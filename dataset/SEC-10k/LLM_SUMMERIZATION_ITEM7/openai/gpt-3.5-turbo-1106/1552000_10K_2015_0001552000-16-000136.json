We are engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\nSIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\nSignificant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 are listed below.

The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the MarkWest Merger, we recorded approximately $2.5 billion of goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Investments for discussion of recent circumstances that may impact the assessment of goodwill impairment.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) provision for income taxes; (iii)non-cash equity-based compensation; (iv) net interest and other financial costs; (v) equity investment income; (vi) equity method distributions; and (vii) acquisition costs. We also use DCF, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA plus (i) the current period cash received/deferred revenue for committed volume deficiencies less (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) unrealized gain on commodity hedges; (v) equity investment capital expenditures paid out; (vi) equity investment cash contributions; (vii) maintenance capital expenditures paid; (viii) volume deficiency credits recognized; and (ix) other non-cash items.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Results of Operations.\nManagement evaluates contract performance on the basis of net operating margin (a non-GAAP financial measure), which is defined as segment revenue less purchased product costs less any derivative gain (loss). These charges have been excluded for the purpose of enhancing the understanding by both management and investors of the underlying baseline operating performance of our contractual arrangements, which management uses to evaluate our financial performance for purposes of planning and forecasting. Net operating margin does not have any standardized definition and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other reporting companies. Net operating margin results should not be evaluated in isolation of, or as a substitute for, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of net operating margin and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations expected in the future, or that we will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods.\nIn evaluating our financial performance, management utilizes the segment performance measures, segment revenues and segment operating income, including total segment operating income. These financial measures are presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 and are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented outside of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of these measures allows investors to understand how management evaluates financial performance to make operating decisions and allocate resources. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 for the reconciliations of these segment measures, including total segment operating income to their respective most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCOMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOur acquisitions have impacted comparability of our financial results (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

This variance was primarily due to an $83 million increase in the G&P segment from the MarkWest Merger and a $2 million increase resulting from higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to a 13 mbpd reduction in third-party crude oil and products volumes shipped.\nService revenue to related parties increased $30 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to a $32 million increase due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped and a $3 million increase in storage fees and other revenue related to the expansion of the Patoka Tank Farms, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in revenue related to volume deficiency credits recognized.\nProduct sales increased $36 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nOther income and other income - related parties increased a total of $7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees received for operating MPC's private pipeline systems and an increase due to the MarkWest Merger.\nCost of revenues increased $27 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nPurchased product costs increased $20 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nPurchases from related parties increased $4 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC, partially offset by increased capitalization of employee costs associated with capital projects.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $39 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $39 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily related to $30 million in acquisition costs.\nOther taxes increased $3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to property taxes from the MarkWest Merger.\nInterest expense and other financial costs increased $42 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was due to borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility, term loan and senior notes in connection with the MarkWest Merger. The increase was also due to $6 million in transaction costs related to the exchange of MarkWest senior notes for MPLX senior notes.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, MPC did not ship its minimum committed volumes on certain of our pipeline systems. As a result, MPC was obligated to make $44 million and $41 million of deficiency payments in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We record deficiency payments as Deferred revenue - related parties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue of $38 million and $45 million, respectively, related to volume deficiency credits. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the cumulative balance of Deferred revenue - related parties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to volume deficiencies was $36 million and $30 million, respectively. The following table presents the future expiration dates of the associated deferred revenue credits for 2015:\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will recognize revenue for the deficiency payments in future periods at the earlier of when volumes are transported in excess of the minimum quarterly volume commitments and when it becomes impossible to physically transport volumes necessary to utilize the accumulated credits or upon expiration of the make-up period. However, deficiency payments are included in the determination of DCF in the period in which a deficiency occurs since the cash has been received.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nService revenue decreased $10 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This variance was primarily due to a $14 million decrease related to a 47 mbpd reduction in third-party crude oil and products volumes shipped, offset by a $4 million increase resulting from higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped.\nService revenue to related parties increased $67 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily related to a $40 million increase in revenue related to volume deficiency credits and $25 million due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped.\nOther income and other income - related parties increased a total of $5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in fees received for operating MPC's private pipeline systems.\nCost of revenues increased $9 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in contract services used for maintenance activities.\nPurchases from related parties increased $3 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the completion of various capital projects.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $12 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in 2014 is primarily related to services provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC and increased consulting fees related to the acquisitions in 2014.\nOther taxes increased $1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased property taxes from investment activities in 2014.\nInterest expense and other financial costs increased $4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was due to borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility and new term loan in 2014.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nWe classify our business in the following reportable segments: L&S and G&P. Segment operating income represents income from operations attributable to the reportable segments. We have investments in entities that we operate that are accounted for using equity method investment accounting standards. However, we view financial information as if those investments were consolidated. Corporate general and administrative expenses, unrealized derivative gains (losses) and depreciation are not allocated to the reportable segments. Management does not consider these items allocable to or controllable by any individual segment and, therefore, excludes these items when evaluating segment performance. Segment results are also adjusted to exclude the portion of income from operations attributable to the noncontrolling interests related to partially owned entities that are either consolidated or accounted for as equity method investments.\nThe tables below present information about segment operating income for the reported segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

information, as evaluated by management, for the reported segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This is a supplemental disclosure showing G&P segment results as if it were acquired as of January 1, 2014 and it incorporates pro forma adjustments necessary, including the removal of approximately $90 million of transaction costs, to reflect a January 1, 2014 acquisition date (see reconciliations below). The pro forma information was prepared in a manner consistent with Article 11 of Regulation S-X and FASB ASC Topic 805 (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4). We believe this full year data will provide a more meaningful discussion of trends for the G&P segment as it helps convey the impact of commodity pricing and volume changes to the business. Future results may vary significantly from the results reflected below because of various factors. In addition, all Partnership operated, non-wholly owned subsidiaries are treated as if they are consolidated for segment reporting purposes (for more information on how management has determined our segments see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9).\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues and other income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Costs and expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(294\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income before portion attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment portion attributable to noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>935\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSegment revenue decreased due to a 39 percent decrease in natural gas prices and a 50 percent decrease in NGL prices over the same period in 2014. There was a $151 million decrease in inventory sold compared to the same period in 2014 due to changes in contractual terms. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in volumes. Total gathering throughput, total natural gas processed and total C2+ NGLs fractionated volumes increased by 28 percent, 36 percent and 30 percent, respectively.\nSegment cost of revenues decreased mainly due to a decrease of $152 million in inventory sold compared to the same period in 2014 due to changes in contractual terms and decreases in natural gas purchased prices and NGL prices. Segment cost of revenues as a percentage of segment revenue decreased 13 percent for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in fee revenue as a percent of total revenue by 16%. The decreases were partially offset by increased expenses related to the expansion of Utica and Marcellus operations.\nThe change in the segment portion of operating income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased due to ongoing growth in our entities that are not wholly owned.\nReconciliation of Segment Operating Income to Consolidated Income Before Provision for Income Tax\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of G&P's segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP to G&P income from operations, G&P segment revenues and other income to G&P total revenues and other income, and G&P segment portion attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $21 million decrease in net income and a $57 million unfavorable impact from changes in working capital as discussed below, partially offset by a $15 million increase in all other, net.\nFor 2015, changes in working capital were a net $38 million use of cash. Third-party receivables were a $29 million use of cash primarily due to higher third-party tariff revenue receivables. Net liabilities to related parties were an $8 million use of cash. Third-party accounts payables and liabilities were a $4 million source of cash due to the timing of project expenditures.\nFor 2014, changes in working capital were a net $19 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in net liabilities to related parties and a decrease in third-party receivables. Net liabilities to related parties increased $15 million from 2013, primarily due to an increase in payables to related parties under the omnibus and employee services agreements and a decrease in receivables from related parties. Third-party receivables decreased $2 million primarily associated with lower tariff revenue receivables from lower product volumes shipped and timing of collections.\nFor 2013, changes in working capital were a net $22 million source of cash, primarily due to an increase in net liabilities to related parties and a decrease in third-party receivables. Net liabilities to related parties increased $19 million from 2012, primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue associated with deficiency payments, partially offset by an increase in receivables from related parties. Third-party receivables decreased $5 million primarily due to lower tariff revenue receivables from lower product volumes shipped.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.4 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to $1.2 billion increase in acquisitions due to the MarkWest Merger and $185 million increase in additions to property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $39 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a $28 million decrease in additions to property, plant and equipment. Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment were $79 million in 2014 and $107 million in 2013. The reduction was primarily associated with lower expansion capital expenditures in 2014.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $1.3 billion compared to net cash used in 2014 of $199 million. The source of cash in 2015 was primarily due to $1.2 billion of contributions from MPC for the MarkWest Merger, $38 million in increased net long-term debt borrowings, $8 million in net proceeds from related party debt with MPC and $169 million in net proceeds from MPLX GP in exchange for a number of general partnership units that allowed it to maintain its general partnership interest, partially offset by $159 million in distributions to unitholders, general partner and noncontrolling interests. The use of cash in 2014 was primarily due to $910 million in distributions to MPC related to the acquisition of an interest in Pipe Line Holdings and $150 million in distributions to unitholders, general partner and noncontrolling interests, partially offset by $634 million in net long-term debt borrowings and $230 million in net proceeds from equity offerings.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $62 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to $632 million in increased net long-term debt borrowings and $230 million in net proceeds from the equity offerings of common units representing limited partnership interests and contributions from MPLX GP LLC in exchange for a number of general\npartnership units that allowed it to maintain its two percent general partnership interest, partially offset by $810 million in increased distributions to MPC related to the acquisition of interests in Pipe Line Holdings.\nDebt and Liquidity Overview\nOur outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of the following:\nTable 330: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPLX LP:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank revolving credit facility due 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility due 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.500% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.500% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.875% senior notes due 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.000% senior notes due 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.875% senior notes due 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated subsidiaries:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MarkWest - 5.500% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MarkWest - 4.500% senior notes due 2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MarkWest - 4.875% senior notes due 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MarkWest - 4.875% senior notes due 2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPL - capital lease obligations due 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized debt issuance costs(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unamortized discount(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(472\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts due within one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt due after one year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We adopted the updated FASB debt issuance cost standard as of June 30, 2015.

In connection with the closing of the MarkWest Merger, we entered into an amendment to our MPLX Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the aggregate amount of revolving credit capacity under the credit agreement by $1 billion for total aggregate commitments of $2 billion and to extend the maturity of the revolving credit facility to December 4, 2020. The term loan facility was not amended and matures on November 20, 2019. Also in connection with the closing of the MarkWest Merger, MarkWest's bank revolving credit facility was terminated and the approximately $943 million outstanding under MarkWest's bank revolving credit facility was repaid with $850 million of borrowings under MPLX's bank revolving credit facility and $93 million of cash. We incurred approximately $2 million of costs related to the borrowing on the bank revolving credit facility.\nThe bank revolving credit facility includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $250 million and swingline capacity of up to $100 million. The borrowing capacity under the MPLX Credit Agreement may be increased by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of lenders whose commitments would increase. In addition, the maturity date may be extended from time-to-time during its term to a date that is one year after the then-effective maturity subject to the approval of lenders holding the majority of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will be terminated on the then-effective maturity date. During 2015, we borrowed $992 million under the bank revolving credit facility, at an average interest rate of 1.617 percent, and repaid $500 million of these borrowings. At December 31, 2015, we had $877 million of borrowings and $8 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility, resulting in total unused loan availability of $1.1 billion, or 55.8 percent of the borrowing capacity.\nThe term loan facility was drawn in full on November 20, 2014. The maturity date for the term loan facility may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to the consent of the lenders holding a majority of the outstanding term loan borrowings, provided that the portion of the term loan borrowings held by any non-consenting lenders will continue to be due and payable on the then-effective maturity date. The borrowings under this facility during 2015 were at an average interest rate of 1.670 percent.\nBorrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Adjusted LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement), at our election, plus a specified margin. We are charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the bank revolving credit facility and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates and certain of the fees fluctuate based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time on our long-term debt.\nThe MPLX Credit Agreement includes certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of that type. The financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict us and certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on our assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with this financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 4.6 to 1.0, as well as other covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had five series of senior notes outstanding: $750 million in aggregate principal amount on the senior notes issued in August 2012 and due February 2023; $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount on senior notes issued in January 2013 and due July 2023; $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount on senior notes issued in November 2014 and due in December 2024; $500 million aggregate principal amount on senior notes issued in February 2015 and due February 2025; and $1.2 billion aggregate principal amount on senior notes issued in June 2015 and due in June 2025 (altogether the Senior Notes Outstanding\u201d). As of December 31, 2015, there were no minimum principal payments on the Senior Notes Outstanding due during the next five years. For further discussion of the Senior Notes Outstanding and other debt related information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16.\nOur intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of December 31, 2015, we had the following credit rating grade levels.\nTable 333: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Agency\n</td> <td>Rating\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch\n</td> <td>BBB- (stable outlook)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's\n</td> <td>Baa3 (stable outlook)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>BBB- (stable outlook)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nThe MPLX Credit Agreement does not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades in the credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt to below investment grade credit ratings would increase the applicable interest rates and other fees payable under the MPLX Credit Agreement and may limit our flexibility to obtain future financing.\nOur liquidity totaled $1.7 billion at December 31, 2015 consisting of:\nTable 334: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>Total Capacity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\nCapacity\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPLX - bank revolving credit facility(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(885\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPC Investment - loan agreement\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>492\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(893\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 335: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Outstanding borrowings includes $8 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit agreements, funding from MPC and opportunistically issuing additional debt and equity securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term funding requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations, repayment of debt maturities and quarterly cash distributions. MPC manages some of our cash and cash equivalents on our behalf directly with third-party institutions as part of the treasury services that it provides to us under our omnibus agreement. From time to time we may also consider other sources of liquidity, including formation of joint ventures or sales of non-strategic assets.\nEquity Overview\nThe table below summarizes the changes in the number of units outstanding through December 31, 2015:\nTable 336: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In units)\n</td> <td>Common\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Class B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Subordinated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>General Partner\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>36,951,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,951,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,508,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,411,255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unit-based compensation awards\n</td> <td>15,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution of interest in Pipe Line Holdings\n</td> <td>2,924,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,983,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 2014 equity offering\n</td> <td>3,450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,520,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>43,341,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,951,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,638,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,931,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unit-based compensation awards\n</td> <td>18,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of units for Pipe Line Holdings acquisition\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Issuance of units under the ATM program\n</td> <td>25,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated unit conversion\n</td> <td>36,951,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,951,515\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MarkWest Merger\n</td> <td>216,350,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,981,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,160,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229,493,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>296,687,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,981,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,800,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311,469,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor more details on equity activity, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8.\nWe intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit, which equates to $79.7 million per quarter, or $318.8 million per year, based on the number of common and general partner units. On January 25, 2016, we announced that the board of directors of our general partner had declared a distribution of $0.5000 per unit that was paid on February 12, 2016 to unitholders of record on February 4, 2016. This represents a 29 percent increase in 2015. This increase in the distribution is consistent with our intent to maintain an attractive distribution growth profile over the long term. Although our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we do not otherwise have a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per common unit.\nThe allocation of total quarterly cash distributions to general and limited partners is as follows for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end; therefore, the following table represents total cash distributions applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned.\nTable 337: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution declared:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limited partner units - public\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Limited partner units - MPC\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General partner units - MPC\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive distribution rights - MPC\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total distribution declared\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions declared per limited partner common unit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter ended March 31\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.4100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.3275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter ended June 30\n</td> <td>0.4400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter ended September 30\n</td> <td>0.4700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter ended December 31\n</td> <td>0.5000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year ended December 31\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.8200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.1675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, enhance or maintain existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, growth capital expenditures are those incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating capacity to increase volumes gathered, processed, transported or fractionated, decrease operating expenses within our facilities or increase operating income over the long term. Examples of growth capital expenditures include the acquisition of equipment or the construction costs associated with new well connections, development or acquisition of additional pipeline or storage capacity. In general, growth capital includes costs that are expected to generate additional or new cash flow for the Partnership.\nOur capital expenditures for the past three years are shown in the table below:\nTable 338: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Increase in capital accruals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to property, plant and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures of unconsolidated subsidiaries(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint venture partner contributions(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross capital expenditures, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 339: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes amounts related to unconsolidated, partnership operated subsidiaries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 340: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>This represents estimated joint venture partners share of growth capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur board originally approved a 2016 growth capital plan of $1.7 billion. In light of current market conditions, we expect capital spending to be between $800 million and $1.2 billion. The G&P segment capital plan is primarily for investment in gathering, processing, and fractionation infrastructure in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays, as well as the STACK and SCOOP formations in the Cana-Woodford Shale in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. The L&S segment capital plan is primarily related to the Cornerstone project and downstream Utica infrastructure development. The Cornerstone project is the building block for the other projects that will become a critical solution for the industry to move condensate and natural gas liquids out of the Utica region into refining centers in Northwest Ohio and connect the pipelines to\nCanada. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. On February 3, 2016, we announced that MPC has offered to contribute its inland marine business in exchange for securities, which would be in addition to the capital plan amounts above.\nWe have revised our timeline for completion of certain capital projects that are classified as construction in progress within Property, plant and equipment, net in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The omnibus agreement with MPC addresses our payment of a fixed annual fee to MPC for the provision of executive management services by certain executive officers of our general partner and our reimbursement to MPC for the provision of certain general and administrative services to us. The omnibus agreement remains in full force and effect so long as MPC controls our general partner. Under the omnibus agreement, we pay to MPC in equal monthly installments an annual amount of approximately $37 million in 2015 for the provision of services by MPC, such as information technology, engineering, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources and other administrative services. The annual amount includes a fixed annual fee of approximately $4 million for the provision of certain executive management services by certain officers of our general partner.\nWe also pay MPC additional amounts based on the costs actually incurred by MPC in providing other services, except for the portion of the amount attributable to engineering services, which is based on the amounts actually incurred by MPC and its affiliates plus six percent of such costs. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse MPC for any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by MPC on our behalf.\nOne of the employee services agreement with MPC addresses reimbursement to MPC for the provision of certain operational and management services to us in support of our pipelines, barge dock and tank farms. This employee services agreement has an initial term that extends through September 30, 2017. We pay MPC a monthly fee that reflects the total employee-based salary and wage costs (including accruals) incurred in providing these services during such month, including a monthly allocated portion of estimated employee benefit costs, bonus accrual, MPC stock-based compensation expense and employer payroll taxes, plus an additional $125,000. On December 28, 2015, MPLX LP entered into an employee services agreement with MW Logistics Services LLC ( MWLS\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, MWLS provides operational and management services to MPLX in support of the assets owned or operated by MarkWest, as well as certain other services to support the MPLX business. Under the terms of the agreement, MPLX pays MWLS a monthly fee to reflect the total employee-based salary, wage and benefits costs and other expenses incurred by MWLS in providing the services during such month. The agreement is effective until December 28, 2020 and automatically renews for two additional renewal terms for up to five years each unless terminated earlier under the provisions of the agreement. We incurred $97 million of expenses under the employee services agreements for 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not engage in off-balance sheet financing activities. As of December 31, 2015, we have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nForward-looking Statements\nOur opinions concerning liquidity and capital resources and our ability to avail ourselves in the future of the financing options mentioned in the above forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. If this information proves to be inaccurate, future availability of financing may be adversely affected. Factors that affect the availability of financing include our performance (as measured by various factors, including cash provided by operating activities), the state of worldwide debt and equity markets, investor perceptions and expectations of past and future performance, the global financial climate, and, in particular, with respect to borrowings, the levels of our outstanding debt and future credit ratings by rating agencies. The discussion of liquidity and capital resources above also contains forward-looking statements regarding expected capital spending. The forward-looking statements about our capital budget are based on current expectations, estimates and projections and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, estimates and projections and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include prices of and demand for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and refined products, actions of competitors, delays in obtaining necessary third-party approvals and governmental permits, changes in labor, material and equipment costs and availability, planned and unplanned outages, the\ndelay of, cancellation of or failure to implement planned capital projects, project overruns, disruptions or interruptions of our operations due to the shortage of skilled labor and unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other operating and economic considerations.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years, it is still a factor in the United States economy and may increase the cost to acquire, build or replace property, plant and equipment. It may also increase the costs of labor and supplies. To the extent permitted by competition, regulation and our existing agreements, we have and expect to continue to pass along all or a portion of increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nMPC owns our general partner and an approximate 18.2 percent limited partner interest (excluding the Class A units owned by MarkWest Hydrocarbon, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, and including the Class B units on an as-converted basis) in us as of February 12, 2016 and all of our incentive distribution rights.\nExcluding revenues attributable to volumes shipped by MPC under joint tariffs with third parties that are treated as third-party revenues for accounting purposes, MPC accounted for 72 percent, 86 percent and 83 percent of our total revenues and other income for 2015, 2014 and 2013. We provide to MPC crude oil and product pipeline transportation services based on regulated tariff rates and storage services based on contracted rates.\nOf our total costs and expenses, MPC accounted for 31 percent for 2015 and 42 percent for 2014 and 2013. MPC performed certain services for us related to information technology, engineering, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources and other administrative services.\nWe believe that transactions with related parties, other than certain transactions with MPC for periods prior to the Initial Offering, related to the provision of administrative services, have generally been conducted under terms comparable to those with unrelated parties. For further discussion of activity with related parties and MPC see Item 1. Business - Our Transportation and Storage Services Agreements with MPC, - Operating and Management Services Agreements with MPC and Third Parties, - Other Agreements with MPC and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to remediate environmental damage from any discharge of hazardous, petroleum or chemical substances from our facilities or require us to install additional pollution control equipment on our equipment and facilities. Our failure to comply with these or any other environmental or safety-related regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational constraints.\nFuture expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various facilities. The impact of these legislative and regulatory developments, if enacted or adopted, could result in increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions on our business, each of which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. MPC will indemnify us for certain of these costs under the omnibus agreement.\nIf these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the fees and tariff rates we receive for our services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the age and location of its operating facilities. Our environmental expenditures for each of the past three years were:\nTable 350: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compliance:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remediation(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash accruals for environmental remediation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.\nNew or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.\nOur environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $1 million in 2016. Actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\nThe policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional information on these policies and estimates, as well as a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates.\nTable 352: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>Judgments and Uncertainties\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nEstimates and Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>In accounting for business combinations, acquired assets and liabilities, noncontrolling interests, if any, and contingent consideration are recorded based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored.\nThe excess or shortfall of the purchase price when compared to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired, if any, and noncontrolling interests, if any, is recorded as goodwill or a bargain purchase gain, respectively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in estimating the individual fair values of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, equity method investments, contingent consideration, other assets and liabilities and noncontrolling interests. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for certain acquisitions, engage third-party consultants for assistance. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, after the acquisition closing date through the end of the measurement period of up to one year as we finalize valuations for the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interest, if any.\n</td> <td>The fair value of assets, liabilities, including contingent consideration, and noncontrolling interests as of the acquisition date are often estimated using a combination of approaches, including the income approach, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount rate; the cost approach, which requires estimates of replacement costs and useful life and obsolescence estimates; and the market approach which uses market data and adjusts for entity-specific differences. Additionally, for customer contract intangibles we must estimate the expected life of the relationship with our customers on a reporting unit basis. The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.\n</td> <td>If estimates or assumptions used to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests significantly differed from assumptions made, the allocation of purchase price between goodwill, intangibles, noncontrolling interests, equity method investments and property plant and equipment could significantly differ. Such a difference would impact future earnings through depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, if forecasts supporting the valuation of the intangibles or goodwill are not achieved, impairments could arise. Further, if customer relationships terminate prior to the expected useful life, we will be required to record a charge to operations to write-off any remaining unamortized balance of the intangible asset assigned to that customer.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for additional information on the MarkWest Merger. That acquisition was completed effective December 4, 2015. Therefore, it is possible that adjustments will be made to the purchase price allocation during the year-ending December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>Judgments and Uncertainties\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from\nEstimates and Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Management evaluates our long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment when certain events have taken place that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from the expected undiscounted future cash flows. Qualitative and quantitative information is reviewed in order to determine if a triggering event has occurred or if an impairment indicator exists. If we determine that a triggering event has occurred we would complete a full impairment analysis. If we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit is not recoverable, a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value. We evaluate our property, plant and equipment and intangibles on at least a segment level and at lower levels where cash flows for specific assets can be identified, which generally is the plant level for our G&P segment, the pipeline system level for our L&S segment, and the customer relationship for our customer contract intangibles.\n</td> <td>Management considers the volume of reserves dedicated to be processed by the asset and future NGL product and natural gas prices to estimate cash flows for each asset group. Management considers the expected net operating margin to be earned by customers for each customer contract intangible. Management uses discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each asset considered. The amount of additional reserves developed by future drilling activity and expected net operating margin earned by customer depends, in part, on expected commodity prices. Projections of reserves, drilling activity, ability to renew contracts of significant customers, and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors, many of which are difficult to forecast. Management considered the sustained reduction of commodity prices in forecasted cash flows.\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, there were no indicators of impairment for any of our long-lived assets, primarily as a result of the G&P segment's assets and customer contract intangible assets being recorded at fair value as of December 4, 2015.\nA significant variance in any of the assumptions or factors used to estimate future cash flows would have resulted in a different allocation of the purchase price, resulting in an increased/(decreased) carrying value of goodwill recorded as of December 4, 2015. This would have changed depreciation/amortization expense on a prospective basis as long-lived assets are depreciated/amortized and goodwill is not amortized.\nSee Item 8.

We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of November 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The first step of the evaluation is a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not\u201d that the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill exceeds its fair value. The additional quantitative steps in the goodwill impairment test may be performed if we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value is greater than the fair value.\n</td> <td>Management performed a quantitative analysis and determined the fair value of our reporting units using the income and market approaches for our 2015 impairment analysis. These types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry and economic factors such as relevant commodity prices, contract renewals, and production volumes. It is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. Management also performed a quantitative analysis on the goodwill reported in the L&S segment.\nFor the current year qualitative analysis, we analyzed whether there were any changes in the assumptions used to perform our December 4, 2015 purchase price allocation in light of current economic conditions to determine if it was more likely than not that impairment exists in the G&P segment. Management also performed a qualitative analysis on the goodwill reported in the L&S segment.\nManagement is also required to make certain assumptions when identifying the reporting units and determining the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit. The method of allocating goodwill resulting from the acquisitions involved estimating the fair value of the reporting units and allocating the purchase price for each acquisition to each reporting unit. Goodwill is then calculated for each reporting unit as the excess of the allocated purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets.\n</td> <td>As of December 31, 2015, there were no indicators of impairment for our goodwill, primarily as a result of the goodwill allocated to reporting units in the G&P segment being recorded at their fair values in connection with the December 4, 2015 MarkWest Merger.\nThe carrying values of the G&P segment reporting units equaled their fair values as of the date of the merger. Any decrease in the fair value of these reporting units going forward could result in an impairment charge to the approximate $2.5 billion of goodwill recorded in connection with the MarkWest Merger.\nIn February of 2016, our units were trading at a price per unit significantly lower that the price per unit used to calculate the merger consideration and the resulting goodwill that was assigned to certain reporting units in our G&P segment.\nThe significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values recorded in acquisition accounting and the resulting goodwill assigned to the reporting units included discount rates, growth rates and customer attrition rates. If we experience negative events related to these assumptions or if the market price of our units continues to trade at a low level in 2016, we may need to assess whether this is a change in circumstances that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill was assigned in connection with the merger is less than the carrying value and, if so, evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nSee Item 8.

We have a gas purchase agreement with a producer customer in which we are required to purchase natural gas based on a complex formula designed to share some of the frac spread with the producer customer, through December 31, 2022. Additionally, we have a keep-whole gas processing agreement with the same producer customer. For accounting purposes, these two contracts have been aggregated into a single contract, and are evaluated together. The agreements have primary terms that expire on December 31, 2022 and contain two successive term-extending options under which the producer customer can extend the purchase and processing agreements an additional five years each. Neither contract may be extended without an election to extend the other contract.\nThe feature of the gas purchase contract to purchase gas based on a complex formula designed to share some of the frac spread with the producer customer and the option to extend both contracts have been identified as a single embedded derivative ( Natural Gas Embedded Derivative\u201d) that requires a complex valuation based on significant judgment. The option to extend the contracts is part of the embedded feature and thus is required to be considered in the valuation of the embedded derivative. We are required to make a significant judgment about the probability that the option would be exercised when determining the value of the embedded derivative.\n</td> <td>We carry the Natural Gas Embedded Derivative at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income each period. The valuation requires significant judgment when forming the assumptions used. Third-party forward curves for certain commodity prices utilized in the valuation do not extend through the term of the arrangement. Thus, pricing is required to be extrapolated for those periods. We utilize multiple cash flow techniques to extrapolate NGL pricing. Due to the illiquidity of future markets, we do not believe one method is more indicative of fair value than the other methods. The fair value is also appropriately adjusted for non-performance risk each period.\nWe evaluated various factors in order to determine the probability that the term-extending options would be exercised by the producer customer such as estimates of future gas reserves in the region, the competitive environment in which the producer customer operates, the commodity price environment and the producer customer's business strategy. As of December 31, 2015, we have estimated the probability that the producer customer will exercise its option to extend the agreements for the first renewal period is 50%, and for the second renewal period is 75% based on the inherent uncertainty of the variables that would impact its decision.\n</td> <td>The Natural Gas Embedded Derivative is an instrument that is not exchange-traded. The valuation of the instrument is complex and requires significant judgment. The inputs used in the valuation model require specialized knowledge, as NGL price curves do not exist for the entire term of the arrangement.\nThe valuation is sensitive to NGL and natural gas future price curves. Holding the natural gas curves constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in NGL price curves causes a 46% increase (decrease) in the liability as of December 31, 2015. Holding the NGL curves constant, a 10% increase (decrease) in the natural gas curves causes a 56% (decrease) increase in the liability as of December 31, 2015. The determination of the fair value of the option to extend is based on our judgment about the probability of the producer customer exercising the extension. If it were determined that the probability of exercise was 25% for the first renewal period and 50% for the second renewal period as of December 31, 2015, the liability would be reduced by 18%. If it were determined that the probability of exercise was 75% for the first renewal period and 100% for the second renewal period as of December 31, the liability would be increased by 21%.\nSee Item 8.

Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's assets.\nWhen we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nWe consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated.\n</td> <td>Significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE.\nWe use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns.\nWe evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group.\nWe continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.\n</td> <td>MarkWest Utica EMG and Ohio Condensate are VIEs; however, we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, they are accounted for under the equity method. Changes in the design or nature of the activities of either of these entities, or our involvement with an entity, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a VIE and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. Such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. This could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements. Ohio Gathering is a subsidiary of MarkWest Utica EMG and is a VIE. If we were to consolidate MarkWest Utica EMG, Ohio Gathering would need to be assessed for consolidation or deconsolidation.\nWe account for our ownership interest in Centrahoma and MarkWest Pioneer under the equity method and have determined that these entities are not VIEs. However, changes in the design or nature of the activities of either entities may require us to reconsider our conclusions. Such reconsideration would require the identification of the variable interests in the entity and a determination on which party is the entity's primary beneficiary. If an equity investment were considered a VIE and we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, the change could cause us to consolidate the entity. The consolidation of an entity that is currently accounted for under the equity method could have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nSee Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business.

We are engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\nSIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\nSignificant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 are listed below. Refer to Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details.\n \u2022 On December 4, 2015, we completed the MarkWest Merger. MarkWest is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX LP. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for more information. \n \u2022 Total segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP increased approximately $185 million, or 87 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was comprised of the following: \n \u2022 An increase of approximately $84 million in our L&S segment is primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Pipe Line Holdings. \n \u2022 An increase of approximately $76 million in our G&P segment is due to the MarkWest Merger. \n \u2022 The offer to exchange MarkWest senior notes for MPLX senior notes and cash expired in December 2015. Approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of MarkWest senior notes were exchanged for MPLX senior notes. We incurred approximately $16 million of expenses related to this exchange. \n \u2022 On October 27, 2015, in connection with the MarkWest Merger, we amended our $1.0 billion bank revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) extend the term of the bank revolving credit facility to a five-year term commencing on the date of the closing of the MarkWest Merger and (ii) increase the borrowing capacity of the bank revolving credit facility to up to $2.0 billion. The amendment became effective in connection with the MarkWest Merger. \n \u2022 In December 2015, we purchased the remaining 0.5 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings from MPC for $12 million. \n \u2022 During the third quarter of 2015, the requirements for the conversion of all subordinated units were satisfied under the partnership agreement. Effective August 17, 2015, 36,951,515 subordinated units owned by MPC were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and prospectively participate on terms equal with all other common units in distributions of available cash. The conversion did not impact the amount of cash distributions paid by the Partnership or total units outstanding. \n \u2022 On February 12, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes. \nIn connection with the MarkWest Merger, we recorded approximately $2.5 billion of goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Investments for discussion of recent circumstances that may impact the assessment of goodwill impairment.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) provision for income taxes; (iii)non-cash equity-based compensation; (iv) net interest and other financial costs; (v) equity investment income; (vi) equity method distributions; and (vii) acquisition costs. We also use DCF, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA plus (i) the current period cash received/deferred revenue for committed volume deficiencies less (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) unrealized gain on commodity hedges; (v) equity investment capital expenditures paid out; (vi) equity investment cash contributions; (vii) maintenance capital expenditures paid; (viii) volume deficiency credits recognized; and (ix) other non-cash items.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Results of Operations.\nManagement evaluates contract performance on the basis of net operating margin (a non-GAAP financial measure), which is defined as segment revenue less purchased product costs less any derivative gain (loss). These charges have been excluded for the purpose of enhancing the understanding by both management and investors of the underlying baseline operating performance of our contractual arrangements, which management uses to evaluate our financial performance for purposes of planning and forecasting. Net operating margin does not have any standardized definition and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other reporting companies. Net operating margin results should not be evaluated in isolation of, or as a substitute for, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of net operating margin and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations expected in the future, or that we will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods.\nIn evaluating our financial performance, management utilizes the segment performance measures, segment revenues and segment operating income, including total segment operating income. These financial measures are presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 and are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented outside of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of these measures allows investors to understand how management evaluates financial performance to make operating decisions and allocate resources. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 for the reconciliations of these segment measures, including total segment operating income to their respective most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCOMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOur acquisitions have impacted comparability of our financial results (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n (1) Non-GAAP financial measure. See the following tables for reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. \nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Items from Adjusted EBITDA attributable to MPLX LP to DCF attributable to MPLX LP are shown net of noncontrolling interest.\n\n (1) MarkWest pre-merger EBITDA and undistributed DCF relates to MarkWest's EBITDA and DCF from Oct. 1, 2015, through Dec. 3, 2015. \n\n (1) MarkWest pre-merger EBITDA and undistributed DCF relates to MarkWest's EBITDA and DCF from Oct. 1, 2015, through Dec. 3, 2015.  The following table presents a reconciliation of net operating margin to income from operations, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\n\n (1) These amounts relate to Partnership operated unconsolidated affiliates. The chief operating decision maker and management include these to evaluate the segment performance as we continue to operate and manage the operations. Therefore, the impact of the revenue is included for segment reporting purposes, but removed for GAAP purposes. \n2015 Compared to 2014\nService revenue increased $81 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to an $83 million increase in the G&P segment from the MarkWest Merger and a $2 million increase resulting from higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to a 13 mbpd reduction in third-party crude oil and products volumes shipped.\nService revenue to related parties increased $30 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to a $32 million increase due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped and a $3 million increase in storage fees and other revenue related to the expansion of the Patoka Tank Farms, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in revenue related to volume deficiency credits recognized.\nProduct sales increased $36 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nOther income and other income - related parties increased a total of $7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees received for operating MPC's private pipeline systems and an increase due to the MarkWest Merger.\nCost of revenues increased $27 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nPurchased product costs increased $20 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nPurchases from related parties increased $4 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC, partially offset by increased capitalization of employee costs associated with capital projects.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $39 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $39 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily related to $30 million in acquisition costs.\nOther taxes increased $3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to property taxes from the MarkWest Merger.\nInterest expense and other financial costs increased $42 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was due to borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility, term loan and senior notes in connection with the MarkWest Merger. The increase was also due to $6 million in transaction costs related to the exchange of MarkWest senior notes for MPLX senior notes.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, MPC did not ship its minimum committed volumes on certain of our pipeline systems. As a result, MPC was obligated to make $44 million and $41 million of deficiency payments in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We record deficiency payments as Deferred revenue - related parties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue of $38 million and $45 million, respectively, related to volume deficiency credits. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the cumulative balance of Deferred revenue - related parties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to volume deficiencies was $36 million and $30 million, respectively. The following table presents the future expiration dates of the associated deferred revenue credits for 2015:\n\nWe will recognize revenue for the deficiency payments in future periods at the earlier of when volumes are transported in excess of the minimum quarterly volume commitments and when it becomes impossible to physically transport volumes necessary to utilize the accumulated credits or upon expiration of the make-up period. However, deficiency payments are included in the determination of DCF in the period in which a deficiency occurs since the cash has been received.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nService revenue decreased $10 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This variance was primarily due to a $14 million decrease related to a 47 mbpd reduction in third-party crude oil and products volumes shipped, offset by a $4 million increase resulting from higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped.\nService revenue to related parties increased $67 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily related to a $40 million increase in revenue related to volume deficiency credits and $25 million due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped.\nOther income and other income - related parties increased a total of $5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in fees received for operating MPC's private pipeline systems.\nCost of revenues increased $9 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in contract services used for maintenance activities.\nPurchases from related parties increased $3 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the completion of various capital projects.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $12 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in 2014 is primarily related to services provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC and increased consulting fees related to the acquisitions in 2014.\nOther taxes increased $1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased property taxes from investment activities in 2014.\nInterest expense and other financial costs increased $4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was due to borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility and new term loan in 2014.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nWe classify our business in the following reportable segments: L&S and G&P. Segment operating income represents income from operations attributable to the reportable segments. We have investments in entities that we operate that are accounted for using equity method investment accounting standards. However, we view financial information as if those investments were consolidated. Corporate general and administrative expenses, unrealized derivative gains (losses) and depreciation are not allocated to the reportable segments. Management does not consider these items allocable to or controllable by any individual segment and, therefore, excludes these items when evaluating segment performance. Segment results are also adjusted to exclude the portion of income from operations attributable to the noncontrolling interests related to partially owned entities that are either consolidated or accounted for as equity method investments.\nThe tables below present information about segment operating income for the reported segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. For information for the year ended December 31, 2013, see Results of Operations.\nL&S Segment\n\nSegment revenue increased due to a $34 million increase in higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in revenue related to volume deficiency credits recognized.\nSegment other income increased due to an increase in storage fees and other revenue related to the expansion of the Patoka Tank Farms.\nSegment cost of revenues increased primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC, partially offset by increased capitalization of employee costs associated with capital projects.\nSegment portion attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased due to the acquisition of the remaining interest of Pipe Line Holdings, of which the 0.5 percent was purchased on December 4, 2015.\nG&P Segment\n\nThe G&P segment increased overall due to the MarkWest Merger.\nThe following tables provide reconciliations of segment operating income to our consolidated income from operations, segment revenue to our consolidated total revenues and other income, and segment portion attributable to noncontrolling interest to our consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial Data and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes various forward-looking statements concerning trends or events potentially affecting our business.

We are engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs and the gathering, transportation and storage of crude oil and refined petroleum products.\nSIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\nSignificant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2015 are listed below. Refer to Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details.\n \u2022 On December 4, 2015, we completed the MarkWest Merger. MarkWest is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX LP. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4 for more information. \n \u2022 Total segment operating income attributable to MPLX LP increased approximately $185 million, or 87 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was comprised of the following: \n \u2022 An increase of approximately $84 million in our L&S segment is primarily due to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Pipe Line Holdings. \n \u2022 An increase of approximately $76 million in our G&P segment is due to the MarkWest Merger. \n \u2022 The offer to exchange MarkWest senior notes for MPLX senior notes and cash expired in December 2015. Approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of MarkWest senior notes were exchanged for MPLX senior notes. We incurred approximately $16 million of expenses related to this exchange. \n \u2022 On October 27, 2015, in connection with the MarkWest Merger, we amended our $1.0 billion bank revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) extend the term of the bank revolving credit facility to a five-year term commencing on the date of the closing of the MarkWest Merger and (ii) increase the borrowing capacity of the bank revolving credit facility to up to $2.0 billion. The amendment became effective in connection with the MarkWest Merger. \n \u2022 In December 2015, we purchased the remaining 0.5 percent interest in Pipe Line Holdings from MPC for $12 million. \n \u2022 During the third quarter of 2015, the requirements for the conversion of all subordinated units were satisfied under the partnership agreement. Effective August 17, 2015, 36,951,515 subordinated units owned by MPC were converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and prospectively participate on terms equal with all other common units in distributions of available cash. The conversion did not impact the amount of cash distributions paid by the Partnership or total units outstanding. \n \u2022 On February 12, 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of four percent unsecured senior notes due February 15, 2025 (the Senior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes were offered at a price to the public of 99.64 percent of par. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility, as well as for general partnership purposes. \nIn connection with the MarkWest Merger, we recorded approximately $2.5 billion of goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if warranted due to events or changes in circumstances. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Investments for discussion of recent circumstances that may impact the assessment of goodwill impairment.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) provision for income taxes; (iii)non-cash equity-based compensation; (iv) net interest and other financial costs; (v) equity investment income; (vi) equity method distributions; and (vii) acquisition costs. We also use DCF, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA plus (i) the current period cash received/deferred revenue for committed volume deficiencies less (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) unrealized gain on commodity hedges; (v) equity investment capital expenditures paid out; (vi) equity investment cash contributions; (vii) maintenance capital expenditures paid; (viii) volume deficiency credits recognized; and (ix) other non-cash items.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see Results of Operations.\nManagement evaluates contract performance on the basis of net operating margin (a non-GAAP financial measure), which is defined as segment revenue less purchased product costs less any derivative gain (loss). These charges have been excluded for the purpose of enhancing the understanding by both management and investors of the underlying baseline operating performance of our contractual arrangements, which management uses to evaluate our financial performance for purposes of planning and forecasting. Net operating margin does not have any standardized definition and, therefore, is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other reporting companies. Net operating margin results should not be evaluated in isolation of, or as a substitute for, our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our use of net operating margin and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations expected in the future, or that we will not, in fact, incur such charges in future periods.\nIn evaluating our financial performance, management utilizes the segment performance measures, segment revenues and segment operating income, including total segment operating income. These financial measures are presented in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 and are considered non-GAAP financial measures when presented outside of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The use of these measures allows investors to understand how management evaluates financial performance to make operating decisions and allocate resources. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9 for the reconciliations of these segment measures, including total segment operating income to their respective most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCOMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nOur acquisitions have impacted comparability of our financial results (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The chief operating decision maker and management include these to evaluate the segment performance as we continue to operate and manage the operations. Therefore, the impact of the revenue is included for segment reporting purposes, but removed for GAAP purposes. \n2015 Compared to 2014\nService revenue increased $81 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to an $83 million increase in the G&P segment from the MarkWest Merger and a $2 million increase resulting from higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped, partially offset by a $5 million decrease related to a 13 mbpd reduction in third-party crude oil and products volumes shipped.\nService revenue to related parties increased $30 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This increase was primarily related to a $32 million increase due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped and a $3 million increase in storage fees and other revenue related to the expansion of the Patoka Tank Farms, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in revenue related to volume deficiency credits recognized.\nProduct sales increased $36 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nOther income and other income - related parties increased a total of $7 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in fees received for operating MPC's private pipeline systems and an increase due to the MarkWest Merger.\nCost of revenues increased $27 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nPurchased product costs increased $20 million in 2015 compared to 2014. This variance was primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nPurchases from related parties increased $4 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC, partially offset by increased capitalization of employee costs associated with capital projects.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $39 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the MarkWest Merger.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $39 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily related to $30 million in acquisition costs.\nOther taxes increased $3 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to property taxes from the MarkWest Merger.\nInterest expense and other financial costs increased $42 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was due to borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility, term loan and senior notes in connection with the MarkWest Merger. The increase was also due to $6 million in transaction costs related to the exchange of MarkWest senior notes for MPLX senior notes.\nDuring 2015 and 2014, MPC did not ship its minimum committed volumes on certain of our pipeline systems. As a result, MPC was obligated to make $44 million and $41 million of deficiency payments in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We record deficiency payments as Deferred revenue - related parties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue of $38 million and $45 million, respectively, related to volume deficiency credits. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the cumulative balance of Deferred revenue - related parties on our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to volume deficiencies was $36 million and $30 million, respectively. The following table presents the future expiration dates of the associated deferred revenue credits for 2015:\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will recognize revenue for the deficiency payments in future periods at the earlier of when volumes are transported in excess of the minimum quarterly volume commitments and when it becomes impossible to physically transport volumes necessary to utilize the accumulated credits or upon expiration of the make-up period. However, deficiency payments are included in the determination of DCF in the period in which a deficiency occurs since the cash has been received.\n2014 Compared to 2013\nService revenue decreased $10 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This variance was primarily due to a $14 million decrease related to a 47 mbpd reduction in third-party crude oil and products volumes shipped, offset by a $4 million increase resulting from higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped.\nService revenue to related parties increased $67 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This increase was primarily related to a $40 million increase in revenue related to volume deficiency credits and $25 million due to higher average tariffs received on the volumes of crude oil and products shipped.\nOther income and other income - related parties increased a total of $5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The net increase was primarily due to an increase in fees received for operating MPC's private pipeline systems.\nCost of revenues increased $9 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in contract services used for maintenance activities.\nPurchases from related parties increased $3 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation expenses provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $1 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the completion of various capital projects.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $12 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in 2014 is primarily related to services provided under the omnibus and employee services agreements with MPC and increased consulting fees related to the acquisitions in 2014.\nOther taxes increased $1 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to increased property taxes from investment activities in 2014.\nInterest expense and other financial costs increased $4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was due to borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility and new term loan in 2014.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nWe classify our business in the following reportable segments: L&S and G&P. Segment operating income represents income from operations attributable to the reportable segments. We have investments in entities that we operate that are accounted for using equity method investment accounting standards. However, we view financial information as if those investments were consolidated. Corporate general and administrative expenses, unrealized derivative gains (losses) and depreciation are not allocated to the reportable segments. Management does not consider these items allocable to or controllable by any individual segment and, therefore, excludes these items when evaluating segment performance. Segment results are also adjusted to exclude the portion of income from operations attributable to the noncontrolling interests related to partially owned entities that are either consolidated or accounted for as equity method investments.\nThe tables below present information about segment operating income for the reported segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. For information for the year ended December 31, 2013, see Results of Operations.\nL&S Segment\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
