Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this filing. This discussion and other parts of this filing contain forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, intentions, and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this filing, and you should not place undue certain on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this filing. See Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a) (19) of the Securities Act. Pursuant to Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, meaning that we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies to delay adoption of such standards until such standards are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nHistorical Development\nReign Sapphire Corporation was established on December 15, 2014 in the State of Delaware as a vertically integrated mines-gate to retail\u201d model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.\nWe have developed relationships with a number of commercial miners in Australia and purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from these commercial miners. We outsource the processing of the rough material to facilities in Asia that meet our quality and ethical criteria and standards, We engage the services of a quality control specialist based in Asia to assist in this process. The outsourced processing includes sorting rough parcels of sapphires and cutting and polishing rough stones. We believe that consumers will appreciate that our sapphires come from a verified source and are processed under our oversight and supervision.\nWe started as UWI Holdings Corporation (previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation) ( UWI\u201d) and was established on May 31, 2013 in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada and listed on the GXG Markets in the UK.\nOn December 31, 2014, UWI entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations with us, pursuant to which UWI transferred all of its net assets to us. The sole shareholder of UWI along with his spouse retained 100% ownership of Reign and were issued 27,845,000 of Reign common shares in exchange for the 16,000,250 outstanding shares of UWI. There was no significant tax consequence to this exchange. As a result, we are considered to be the continuation of the predecessor UWI. All historical financial information prior to the reorganization is that of UWI. While UWI was previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d, the Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d referred to elsewhere in this filing as a current shareholder of the Company is a different entity, a California corporation, formed by Mr. Segelman to hold shares of the Company engage in gemstone marketing consultancy.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>18 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to the reorganization, we were authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. On May 8, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number common shares to 100,000,000 and authorized number of preferred shares to 10,000,000. On December 22, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number common shares to 150,000,000 with the authorized number of preferred shares remaining at 10,000,000.\nFor share and earnings per share information, we have retroactively restated per share and the outstanding shares for weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods presented, as a result of the reorganizations.\nWe began our planned principal operations, and accordingly, we have prepared our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nRecent Developments\nFinancing Transactions\nWe started as UWI (previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation), which was established on May 31, 2013 in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada. On December 31, 2014, UWI entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations with Reign, pursuant to which UWI transferred all of its net assets to Reign. The sole shareholder of UWI along with his spouse retained 100% ownership of Reign and were issued 27,845,000 of Reign common shares in exchange for the 16,000,250 outstanding shares of UWI. There was no significant tax consequence to this exchange. As a result, Reign is considered to be the continuation of the predecessor UWI. All historical financial information prior to the reorganization is that of UWI. While UWI was previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d, the Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d referred to elsewhere in this filing as a current shareholder of the Company is a different entity, a California corporation, formed by Mr. Segelman to hold shares of the Company engage in gemstone marketing consultancy.\nPrior to the reorganization, our Articles of Incorporation authorized the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.0001, with each share of common stock entitled to one vote for all matters on which a shareholder vote is required or requested. We were also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having a par value of $0.0001. On May 8, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number of common shares to 100,000,000 and the authorized number of preferred shares to 10,000,000. On December 22, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number common shares to 150,000,000 with the authorized number of preferred shares remaining at 10,000,000.\nFor share and earnings per share information, we have retroactively restated per share and the outstanding shares for weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods presented, as a result of the reorganizations.\nOur Board of Directors are authorized to provide for the issue of any and all of the unissued and undesignated shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated an expressed in the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn December 23, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with respect to the sale and issuance to certain institutional investors Alpha Capital Anstalt and Brio Capital Master Fund Ltd. (collectively Purchasers\u201d) of up to (i) 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (the Incentive Shares\u201d); (ii) $862,500 aggregate principal amount of Secured Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) and (iii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,187,542 shares of our Common Stock (the Warrants\u201d). The Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants were issued on December 23, 2015 (the Original Issue Date\u201d). Purchasers received (i) Incentive Shares at the rate of 2.8986 Incentive Shares for each $1.00 of Note principal issued to such Purchaser; (ii) a Note with a principal amount of $1.00 for each $0.86956 for each $1.00 paid by each purchaser for such purchaser's Note; and (iii) Warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12 ( Purchaser Conversion Price\u201d), the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment. The aggregate cash subscription amount received by us from the purchasers for the issuance of the Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants was approximately $724,500 (the Subscription Amount\u201d) which was issued at a $138,000 discount from the face value of the Note.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>19 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Notes mature on June 23, 2017, eighteen (18) months after the Original Issue Date, and provide for interest to accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 15% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law after the occurrence of any event of default as provided in the Notes. At any time after the Original Issue Date, the holders, at their option, may convert the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest into shares of our Common Stock. The initial conversion price for the principal and interest in connection with voluntary conversions by a holder of a Note is $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein. Each Note, for example, is subject to adjustment upon certain events such as stock splits and has full ratchet anti-dilution protections for issuance of securities by us at a price that is lower than the conversion price. Each Note also contains certain negative covenants, including prohibitions on incurrence of indebtedness, liens, charter amendments, dividends, redemption. None of the holders of the Note have the right to convert any portion of their Note if it (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise. The Notes include customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of our Common Stock from trading. If such an event of default occurs, the holders of the Notes may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes and accrual of interest as described above. The Notes are collectively collateralized by substantially all of our assets and guarantees of payment of the Notes have also been delivered by Joseph Segelman, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Australian Sapphire Corporation ( ASC\u201d), a stockholder of the Company which is wholly-owned by Joseph Segelman, guaranteed payment of all amounts owed under the Notes, subject to the terms of such guaranty agreements.\nIn addition, until one year after the initial trading date of a Registration Statement which registers all then outstanding or issuable underlying shares, the Purchasers shall have the right to participate in an amount of subsequent financing equal to 100% of the Purchase Agreement.\nOptional Redemption\nThe Notes provide that commencing six (6) months after the Original Issue Date, we will have the option of prepaying the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (an Optional Redemption\u201d), in whole or in part, by paying to the holders a sum of money in cash equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the holder arising under the Note through the Redemption Payment Date and 2.8986 shares of our Common Stock for each $1.00 of Note principal amount being redeemed. A Notice of Redemption, if given, may be given on the first Trading Day following twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days during which all of the Equity Conditions\u201d, as defined, have been in effect.\nPurchaser Conversion\nThe Purchaser has the right at any time after the Original Issue Date until the outstanding balance of the Note has been paid in full, to convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into shares ( Purchaser Conversion Shares\u201d) of our common stock, of the portion of the outstanding balance being converted (the Conversion Amount\u201d) divided by the Purchaser Conversion Price of $0.12, subject to potential future adjustments described below. If the total outstanding balance of the Note were convertible as of December 31, 2015, the Note would have been convertible into 7,187,500 shares of our common stock.\nWe evaluated the note under the requirements of ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and concluded that the Note does not fall within the scope of ASC 480. We next evaluated the Note under the requirements of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the anti-dilution provision which reduces the Purchaser Conversion Price in the event of subsequent dilutive issuances by us below the Purchaser Conversion Price as described above, the Purchaser Conversion feature does not meet the definition of indexed to\u201d our stock, and the scope exception to ASC 815's derivative accounting provisions does not apply. We also evaluated the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and concluded that the Purchaser Conversion feature meets all of the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and therefore, the Purchaser Conversion feature meets the definition of an embedded derivative that should be separated from the note and accounted for as a derivative liability.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>20 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe embedded derivative was recorded as a derivative liability on the Balance Sheet at its fair value of $88,983 at the date of issuance of the Note and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling incorporating the following inputs:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47% - 0.86% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 - 1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Conversion price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be recorded in the Statements of Operations.\nPurchaser Warrants\nThe Purchaser Warrants allow the Purchaser to purchase up to a number of shares of common stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12, the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment.\nThe term of the Purchaser Warrants is at any time on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the Original Issue Date and on or prior to the five (5) year anniversary of the Initial Trading Date of our common stock on a Trading Market.\nThe exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants is $0.30 per share of our common stock, as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the antidilution provisions of the Purchaser Warrants.\nThe Purchaser Warrants are exercisable by the Purchaser in whole or in part, as either a cash exercise or as a cashless\u201d exercise.\nWe evaluated the Warrants under ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the antidilution provision, which reduces the Exercise Price and Conversion Price in the event of subsequent Dilutive Issuances, the Purchaser Warrants are not indexed to our common stock, and we determined that the Purchaser Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815. Accordingly, the Purchaser Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities in the Balance Sheet at their fair value of $439,107 at the date of issuance and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the Purchaser Warrants is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling, incorporating the following inputs:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>1.74% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 - 1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exercise price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the Purchaser Warrants will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be reported in the Statements of Operations.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td>21 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchaser Common Stock\nThe Purchasers were issued a total of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $625,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant).\nAt inception, the total proceeds $724,500 received by us for the Note, Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser Warrants, was allocated first to the Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities at their initial fair values determined at the issuance date. The difference between the full fair value of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities of $1,153,090 and the proceeds of $724,500 was recorded as $433,590 (including $5,000 paid by the CEO on our behalf) of interest expense in the Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nStock Transactions\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued a total of 618,000 restricted common shares, valued at $154,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for marketing, investor relations, and outside consulting services.\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued 10,000 restricted common shares, valued at $2,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of our CEO for marketing services.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to an unrelated third party, valued at $250,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) plus $10,000 cash for the purchase of two trademarks.

We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.\nThe processing of our rough Australian sapphires is done at our contract cutting factories in Asia and includes sorting rough parcels of sapphires and cutting and polishing rough stones. The processing and manufacturing costs are part of inventory costs in the use of proceeds section of this document.\nReign Sapphires is our color gemstone brand and we intend to launch our inaugural jewelry collection via our website www.reignsapphires.com in the second calendar quarter of 2016. The sample jewelry collection has been designed and manufactured and is ready for production.\nOur core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our initial jewelry collections. The Company has sufficient inventory to launch the sample collection.\nThe design direction for the collection we intend to offer is reflective of old Hollywood glamour meeting turn of the century. The inaugural collections we intend to offer are Reign Day-to-Night; featuring classic & timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet; featuring bold designs, made for the stars to hold a time and place in Hollywood's history.\nWe intend to position Reign Sapphires as a premium brand in the price point and company of competitors such as Cartier; Harry Winston; Roberto Coin; Van Cleef & Arpels and Bvlgari. We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong E-commerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust & recognition.

Prior to launching the Company's sales campaign, the Company intends to develop and use association strategy to identify appropriate and strategic partners for co-marketing opportunities.\nPlan of Operations\nAs of the date of this filing, we have generated minimal revenue by selling loose finished gemstones to a number of wholesale customers. We currently have no operational retail website and no retail customers, our activities and operations have been limited to developing our business and financial plans as well as designing and sample manufacturing our inaugural collection which we intend to launch together with our retail website in the second calendar quarter of 2016. We will not have the necessary capital to fully execute the first phase of our business plan until we are able to secure financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. Even if we raise such financing, we may not have sufficient capital to begin generating further revenues from operations.\nWe had no significant operating revenues through December 31, 2015. We expect to have operating revenues in the first half of 2016 as we launch our B2C marketing initiative. Revenues will be predominately the result of fine jewelry sales. At December 31, 2015 our cash balance was negligible.\nOur plan of operations consists of:\nTable 65: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Purchase rough sapphires from commercial miners in Australian and process the rough material into cut gemstones and finished jewelry. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Launch of our B2B marketing and sales efforts through the use of distribution partners and a high-end fashion retailers. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Launch of our B2C marketing and sales efforts through the use of Internet marketing, print advertising, promotions, and signage </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Raise capital to launch Reign Sapphires, fund administrative infrastructure and ongoing operations until our operations generate positive cash flow. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo enable us to launch Reign and take us to the point of being able to generate revenue within 12 months, our activities and milestones for the next 12 months include:\nTable 69: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the development, creation and launch of a lifestyle visual marketing campaign (achieved through the engagement of a branding specialist, marketing consultant and creative director); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the development and roll-out of an E commerce platform and online experience (achieved through the engagement of a digital marketing specialist and E commerce specialist company); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the development and execution of a digital media marketing strategy (achieved through the engagement of a digital media specialist) and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the roll-out of red carpet placements and editorial activities (achieved through the engagement of a luxury markets publicist). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese marketing and promotional activities will take place concurrently and will be ongoing over the 12 months at a cost of $250,000. This is in addition to day-to-day operations and hiring of additional team members, financial activities and strategies at a cost of $275,000 over the next 12 months.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nWe recognize revenue at the time of sale. Revenues are presented net of refunds and known credits.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe currently have no retail sales or operational retail website. Revenue generated to date has been as a result of wholesale sales of loose gemstones; we intend to continue with wholesale sales of loose gemstones to a number of customers with one major customer contributing the bulk of our revenue until we are ready to launch our jewelry collection direct to consumers in the second calendar quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist of the cost of customer service, billing, cost of information systems and personnel required to support our operations and growth.\nDepending on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems. We will need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing new information systems that will provide better record-keeping, customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance that our management resources or information systems will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenue\nRevenue decreased by $13,947, or 32.3%, to $29,207 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $43,154 for the year ended December 31, 2014. To date, revenues have been generated through the sale of loose sapphires. Although we will continue to sell loose sapphires, we will focus on our primary business of placing the loose sapphires in jewelry settings. Therefore, we had no revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2015.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $15,320, or 60.7%, to $9,930 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $25,250 for the year ended December 31, 2014. To date, cost of sales has been generated through the sale of loose sapphires. Although we will continue to sell loose sapphires, we will focus on our primary business of placing the loose sapphires in jewelry settings. Therefore, we had no cost of sales in the current quarter.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $1,866,958, or 460.5%, to $2,272,406 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $405,448 for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to increases in stock based compensation of $1,395,869, consulting services costs of $119,246, rent of $6,007, professional fees of $290,548, marketing costs of $37,423, and general and administration costs of $17,865 as a result of adding administrative infrastructure, primarily consulting, for our current and anticipated sales growth.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we had stock based compensation of $1,395,869, marketing expenses of $42,990, and general and administrative expenses of $833,547 primarily due to consulting costs of $327,024, travel expenses of $77,297, rent of $38,611, professional fees of $342,781, and general and administration costs of $47,834 as a result of adding administrative infrastructure, primarily consulting, for our current and anticipated sales growth, and the costs of our S-1.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we had marketing expenses of $5,567, general and administrative expenses of $399,881 primarily due to consulting costs of $207,778, travel expenses of $78,226, rent of $32,604 professional fees of $52,233, and general and administration costs of $29,040 as a result of startup marketing initiatives and adding administrative infrastructure.\nOther Expense\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to interest expense of $441,181 in conjunction with debt discount recorded in December 2015.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss before income taxes\nNet loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $2,694,310 and $387,544 for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to stock based compensation, consulting services costs, rent, professional fees, marketing costs, and general and administration costs.\nAssets and Liabilities\nAssets were $1,426,996 as of December 31, 2015. Assets consisted primarily of cash of $638,824, inventory of $509,788 which includes samples inventory of $122,774, prepaid expenses of $13,623, equipment of $4,761, and intangible assets of $260,000. Liabilities were $1,509,004 as of December 31, 2015. Liabilities consisted primarily of accrued compensation-related party of $516,000, accounts payable - related party of $396,819, warrant liabilities of $439,107, derivative liabilities of $88,983, advance from shareholder of $55,504, and long-term convertible note of $12,591, net of $849,909 of unamortized debt discount.\nStockholders' (Deficit) Equity\nStockholders' (deficit) equity was ($82,008) as of December 31, 2015. Stockholder's equity consisted primarily of shares issued to founders for cash of $119,000, shares issued to founders for inventory of $150,000, shares issued to founders for services of $250, stock issued for services of $254,450, stock issued for inventory of $300,000, stock issued for intangible assets of $250,000, stock issued for deferred offering costs of $150,000, stock issued with long-term convertible notes of $625,000, and stock based compensation of $1,395,869, offset primarily by the accumulated deficit at December 31, 2015 of $3,326,577.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral - Overall, we had an increase in cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $638,729 resulting from cash provided by financing activities of $735,000, offset partially by cash used in operating activities of $83,820, and cash used in investing activities of $12,451.\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods indicated:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(83,820 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,440 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,451 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,465 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>735,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>638,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - For the year ending December 31, 2015, net cash used in operations was $83,820 compared to net cash used in operations of $44,440 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of $2,694,310 for the year ended December 31, 2015, offset primarily by stock based compensation - related party of $1,395,869, the estimated fair market value of stock issued for services of $167,000, the amortization of stock issued for future services of $48,300, depreciation expense of $1,155, interest expense in conjunction with debt issuance of $433,590, accretion of debt discount of $12,591, deferred offering costs charged to expense of $150,000, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $401,985, primarily due to the increase in accrued compensation - related party of $240,000, accounts payable -related party of $191,416, and inventory of $9,930, offset primarily by accounts receivable of $29,206, and prepaid expenses of $10,155.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily resulted from a net loss of $387,544, offset primarily by the estimated fair market value of stock issued for services of $23,050, the amortization of stock issued for future services of $16,100, and the changes in operating assets and liabilities of $303,954, primarily due to the increase in accrued compensation - related party of $180,000, accounts payable -related party of $103,194, and inventory of $25,249, offset primarily by accounts receivable of $1,021, and prepaid expenses of $3,468.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - For the year ending December 31, 2015, net cash used in investing was $12,451 compared to net cash used in operations of $3,465 for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to purchases of equipment and the acquisition of intangible assets.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - For the year ending December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing was $735,000 compared to net cash provided by operations of $48,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was primarily due to proceeds from long-term convertible notes of $724,500, net of debt issuance costs of $138,000, and advances from shareholder of $10,500.\nThe net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 was primarily due to advances from shareholder of $48,000.\nFinancing - We expect that our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations will be insufficient to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks (see Risk Factors\u201d), and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future.\nWe have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Due to the ongoing global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn December 23, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with respect to the sale and issuance to certain institutional investors Alpha Capital Anstalt and Brio Capital Master Fund Ltd. (collectively Purchasers\u201d) of up to (i) 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (the Incentive Shares\u201d); (ii) $862,500 aggregate principal amount of Secured Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) and (iii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,187,542 shares of our Common Stock (the Warrants\u201d). The Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants were issued on December 23, 2015 (the Original Issue Date\u201d). Purchasers received (i) Incentive Shares at the rate of 2.8986 Incentive Shares for each $1.00 of Note principal issued to such Purchaser; (ii) a Note with a principal amount of $1.00 for each $0.86956 for each $1.00 paid by each purchaser for such purchaser's Note; and (iii) Warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12 ( Purchaser Conversion Price\u201d), the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment. The aggregate cash subscription amount received by us from the purchasers for the issuance of the Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants was approximately $724,500 (the Subscription Amount\u201d) which was issued at a $138,000 discount from the face value of the Note.\nThe Notes mature on June 23, 2017, eighteen (18) months after the Original Issue Date, and provide for interest to accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 15% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law after the occurrence of any event of default as provided in the Notes. At any time after the Original Issue Date, the holders, at their option, may convert the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest into shares of our Common Stock. The initial conversion price for the principal and interest in connection with voluntary conversions by a holder of a Note is $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein. Each Note, for example, is subject to adjustment upon certain events such as stock splits and has full ratchet anti-dilution protections for issuance of securities by us at a price that is lower than the conversion price. Each Note also contains certain negative covenants, including prohibitions on incurrence of indebtedness, liens, charter amendments, dividends, redemption. None of the holders of the Note have the right to convert any portion of their Note if it (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise. The Notes include customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of our Common Stock from trading. If such an event of default occurs, the holders of the Notes may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes and accrual of interest as described above. The Notes are collectively collateralized by substantially all of our assets and guarantees of payment of the Notes have also been delivered by Joseph Segelman, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Australian Sapphire Corporation ( ASC\u201d), a stockholder of the Company which is wholly-owned by Joseph Segelman, guaranteed payment of all amounts owed under the Notes, subject to the terms of such guaranty agreements.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, until one year after the initial trading date of a Registration Statement which registers all then outstanding or issuable underlying shares, the Purchasers shall have the right to participate in an amount of subsequent financing equal to 100% of the Purchase Agreement.\nOptional Redemption\nThe Notes provide that commencing six (6) months after the Original Issue Date, we will have the option of prepaying the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (an Optional Redemption\u201d), in whole or in part, by paying to the holders a sum of money in cash equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the holder arising under the Note through the Redemption Payment Date and 2.8986 shares of our Common Stock for each $1.00 of Note principal amount being redeemed. A Notice of Redemption, if given, may be given on the first Trading Day following twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days during which all of the Equity Conditions\u201d, as defined, have been in effect.\nPurchaser Conversion\nThe Purchaser has the right at any time after the Original Issue Date until the outstanding balance of the Note has been paid in full, to convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into shares ( Purchaser Conversion Shares\u201d) of our common stock, of the portion of the outstanding balance being converted (the Conversion Amount\u201d) divided by the Purchaser Conversion Price of $0.12, subject to potential future adjustments described below. If the total outstanding balance of the Note were convertible as of December 31, 2015, the Note would have been convertible into 7,187,500 shares of our common stock.\nWe evaluated the note under the requirements of ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and concluded that the Note does not fall within the scope of ASC 480. We next evaluated the Note under the requirements of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the anti-dilution provision which reduces the Purchaser Conversion Price in the event of subsequent dilutive issuances by us below the Purchaser Conversion Price as described above, the Purchaser Conversion feature does not meet the definition of indexed to\u201d our stock, and the scope exception to ASC 815's derivative accounting provisions does not apply. We also evaluated the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and concluded that the Purchaser Conversion feature meets all of the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and therefore, the Purchaser Conversion feature meets the definition of an embedded derivative that should be separated from the note and accounted for as a derivative liability.\nThe embedded derivative was recorded as a derivative liability on the Balance Sheet at its fair value of $88,983 at the date of issuance of the Note and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling incorporating the following inputs:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47% - 0.86% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 - 1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Conversion price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be recorded in the Statements of Operations.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchaser Warrants\nThe Purchaser Warrants allow the Purchaser to purchase up to a number of shares of common stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12, the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment.\nThe term of the Purchaser Warrants is at any time on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the Original Issue Date and on or prior to the five (5) year anniversary of the Initial Trading Date of our common stock on a Trading Market.\nThe exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants is $0.30 per share of our common stock, as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the antidilution provisions of the Purchaser Warrants.\nThe Purchaser Warrants are exercisable by the Purchaser in whole or in part, as either a cash exercise or as a cashless\u201d exercise.\nWe evaluated the Warrants under ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the antidilution provision, which reduces the Exercise Price and Conversion Price in the event of subsequent Dilutive Issuances, the Purchaser Warrants are not indexed to our common stock, and we determined that the Purchaser Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815. Accordingly, the Purchaser Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities in the Balance Sheet at their fair value of $439,107 at the date of issuance and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the Purchaser Warrants is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling, incorporating the following inputs:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>1.74% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 - 1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exercise price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the Purchaser Warrants will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be reported in the Statements of Operations.\nPurchaser Common Stock\nThe Purchasers were issued a total of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $625,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant).\nAt inception, the total proceeds $724,500 received by us for the Note, Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser Warrants, was allocated first to the Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities at their initial fair values determined at the issuance date. The difference between the full fair value of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities of $1,153,090 and the proceeds of $724,500 was recorded as $433,590 (including $5,000 paid by the CEO on our behalf) of interest expense in the Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAdvance from Shareholder\nWe borrow funds from our CEO/Director for working capital purposes from time to time. As of December 31, 2015, we have recorded the principal balance due of $55,504 in Advance From Shareholder. We received advances of $10,500 and $48,000, and no repayments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the CEO received $38,637 of our cash receipts on accounts receivable directly from a customer. These amounts reduced advance from shareholder. Advances are non-interest bearing and due on demand. Past loans and advances from our CEO/Director were not made pursuant to any loan agreements or promissory notes, nor will any future loans and advances from our CEO/Director be made pursuant to loan agreements or promissory notes.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock Transactions\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued a total of 618,000 restricted common shares, valued at $154,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for marketing, investor relations, and outside consulting services.\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued 10,000 restricted common shares, valued at $2,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of our CEO for marketing services.\nOn June 30, 2015, we issued an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to an unrelated third party, valued at $250,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) plus $10,000 cash for the purchase of two trademarks. We have recorded a total of $260,000 as intangible assets in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.\nIn February and March 2015, we issued 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $75,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for legal services associated with our initial public offering.\nIn February 2015, we issued 40,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $10,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered.\nOn December 30, 2014, we issued 1,200,000 restricted common shares to an unrelated third party for the purchase of inventory with an estimated fair market value of $300,000. We valued the shares based on the estimated fair market value of the inventory, which was more readily determinable than the fair value of the stock.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we issued 85,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $16,800 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we issued 400,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $64,400 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered or to be rendered.\nOn December 31, 2014, the Company issued 25,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $6,250 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of the Company's CEO for services rendered.\nOn December 31, 2014, we issued 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $75,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for legal services associated with our initial public offering.\nWe have previously filed a registration statement on Form S-1 under the Securities Act that was declared effective on October 30, 2015 (the Original Form S-1\u201d). Pursuant to the Original Form S-1, we proposed to offer 10,000,000 shares of our authorized but unissued Common Stock at an offering price of $0.50 per share. Effective as of January 21, 2016, our board of directors determined that it was in the best interests of the Company to terminate the offering and declared the offering to be terminated immediately as of that date as permitted under the terms of the offering described in the Original Form S-1. As of the date of the termination, no shares of our common stock had been offered or sold under the terms of the offering. A post-effective amendment to the Original Form S-1 has been filed pursuant to Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act to deregister, as of the effectiveness of the post-effective amendment, the 10,000,000 shares of our common stock that were to be offered and sold in the offering due to the termination of the offering as described above.\nStock Based Compensation\nOn May 1, 2015 our board of directors and stockholders authorized the adoption and implementation of the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan\u201d). The principal purpose of the 2015 Plan is to attract, retain and motivate employees, officers, directors, consultants, agents, advisors and independent contractors to us and our related companies by providing them the opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest in us and to link their interests and efforts to the long-term interests of our stockholders. The material terms of the 2015 Plan are summarized in Executive Compensation Plans and Other Benefit Plans\u201d in this filing. Under the 2015 Plan, as amended on December 22, 2015, 14,000,000 shares of our common stock have initially been reserved for issuance pursuant to a variety of stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock and cash-based awards.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn July 1, 2015 ( Grant Date\u201d), we issued our CEO, options for 10,000,000 shares of our common stock under the 2015 Plan, valued at $2,500,000 (based on the Black Scholes valuation model on the Grant Date). The options will vest 50% on the first anniversary of the Grant Date ( First Year Vest\u201d) and the remaining 50% of the shares shall vest in twelve (12) equal installments on the first day of each calendar month following the first anniversary of the Grant Date beginning on June 1, 2016 and ending on June 1, 2017 ( Second Year Vest\u201d), provided that CEO is continuously employed by the Company from the Grant Date through such applicable vesting date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 100% of the shares of the Company's common stock subject to the Option shall fully vest if the Company shall successfully sell all of the shares of its common stock included in the primary offering of such common stock by the Company pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-1 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within ninety (90) days of the Grant Date. The First Year Vest options will amortize to expense over a 12 month period beginning May 2015 through April 2016 and the Second Year Vest options will amortize to expense over a 24 month period beginning May 2015 through April 2017. We recognized expense of $1,395,869 for the year ended December 31, 2015 within stock based compensation in the accompanying Statement of Operations with the remaining $1,104,131 to be recognized over the remaining vesting period.\nManagement used the Black-Scholes valuation model to value the options with known inputs for option term exercise price and stock price and assumptions for expected volatility rate; dividend rate; and risk free interest rate. The table summarizes the Black-Scholes assumptions used in the valuation of the options issued:\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.87 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exercise price </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.005 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpected dividend yield. We base the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nExpected stock-price volatility. As our common stock has never been publicly traded, the expected volatility is derived from the average historical volatilities of publicly traded companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period approximately equal to the expected term.\nRisk-free interest rate. We base the risk-free interest rate assumption on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the stock option grants.\nExpected term of options. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Because the Company does not have historic exercise behavior, the Company determines the expected life assumption using the simplified method, which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its ordinary vesting period.\nStock price. Determined from third party transactions through the purchase of inventory or services provided to us by outside consultants.\nCapital Expenditures\nOther Capital Expenditures\nWe expect to purchase approximately $30,000 of equipment in connection with the expansion of our business.\nFiscal year end\nOur fiscal year end is December 31.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoing Concern\nOur independent registered accounting firm has added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately $3,327,000 and $632,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, had a net loss of approximately $2,694,000 and $388,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and net cash used in operating activities of approximately $84,000 and $44,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with limited revenue earned since inception.\nWhile we are attempting to expand operations and increase revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our daily operations. We intend to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. We believe that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues. Our current burn rate to maintain the minimal level of operations for us to be in a position to execute our business plan upon funding is anticipated to be no greater than $25,000 per month in cash and Joseph Segelman, our President and CEO, has agreed to underwrite these costs until the offering described in this filing is completed and we are then able to begin execution of our business plan. In addition, until the offering described in this filing is completed we will continue to defer and accrue salaries and thus will not require cash to make payments under employment agreements.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Commission has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant to understanding our results.\nThe following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: inventory valuation, and common stock and option valuation. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition\u201d, and with the guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) No. 104 Revenue Recognition\u201d.\nUnder SAB 104, four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when the product is received and accepted by the customer, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. While the products are being transported and delivered to the customer and until the products are accepted by the customer, the suppliers bear the risk of loss. Credit is granted generally for terms of 7 to 90 days, based on credit evaluations.\nWe currently have no return policy. We are currently evaluating our return policy to be more in line with industry standards.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record trade receivables when revenue is recognized. When appropriate, we will record an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables. Those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance. These provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible. Trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no allowance for doubtful accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no accounts written-off.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a lot basis each quarter. A lot is determined by the cut, clarity, size, and weight of the sapphires. Our inventory consists of loose sapphire jewels that meet rigorous grading criteria and are of cuts and sizes most commonly used in the jewelry industry. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, inventory consists of loose sapphire jewels and loose sapphire jewels held as samples. Samples are used to show potential customers what the jewelry would look like. Promotional items given to customers that are not expected to be returned will be removed from inventory and expensed. We appraise our inventory on an annual basis or if circumstances dictate sooner to determine if the estimated fair value is greater or less than cost. In addition, we review the inventory each quarter by the Company against industry prices from gem-guide and if there is a potential impairment, we would appraise the inventory. The estimated fair value is subject to significant change due to changes in popularity of cut, perceived grade of the clarity of the sapphires, the number type and size of inclusions, the availability of other similar quality and size sapphires, and other factors. As a result, the appraised value of the sapphires could be significantly lower from the current estimated fair value. Our loose sapphire jewels do not degrade in quality over time and are not subject to fashion trends. In view of the foregoing factors, we have concluded that no excess or obsolete loose jewel inventory reserve requirements existed as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our balance sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. We must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance in a period are recorded through the income tax provision on the statements of operations.\nFrom the date of our inception we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, we recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.\nStock Based Compensation\nIssuances of our common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a performance commitment\u201d which would include a penalty considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance is complete. However, situations may arise in which counter performance may be required over a period of time but the equity award granted to the party performing the service is fully vested and non-forfeitable on the date of the agreement. As a result, in this situation in which vesting periods do not exist as the instruments fully vested on the date of agreement, we determine such date to be the measurement date and will record the estimated fair market value of the instruments granted as a prepaid expense and amortize such amount to general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations over the contract period. When it is appropriate for us to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior to the measurement date, for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at the then-current fair values at each of those interim financial reporting dates.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>34 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 505, Equity\u201d and FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation,\u201d we perform an analysis of current market data and historical Company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility, the expected term of the option and the expected forfeiture rate. With the exception of the expected forfeiture rate, which is not an input, we use these estimates as variables in the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Depending upon the number of stock options granted, any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our statements of operations and comprehensive income. In addition, any differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements.\nNon-Cash Equity Transactions\nShares of equity instruments issued for non-cash consideration are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received based on the market value of services to be rendered, or at the value of the stock given, considered in reference to contemporaneous cash sale of stock.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe apply the provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of inventory, accrued compensation - related party, and advance from shareholder approximated carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market rates.\nDebt\nWe issue debt that may have separate warrants, conversion features, or no equity-linked attributes.\nDebt with warrants - When we issue debt with warrants, we treat the warrants as a debt discount, record as a contra-liability against the debt, and amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statements of operations. The offset to the contra-liability is recorded as additional paid in capital in our balance sheet. We determine the value of the warrants using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model ( Black-Scholes\u201d) using the stock price on the date of issuance, the risk free interest rate associated with the life of the debt, and the volatility of our stock. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations. The debt is treated as conventional debt.\nConvertible debt - derivative treatment - When we issue debt with a conversion feature, we must first assess whether the conversion feature meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, as follows: a) one or more underlyings, typically the price of our common stock; b) one or more notional amounts or payment provisions or both, generally the number of shares upon conversion; c) no initial net investment, which typically excludes the amount borrowed; and d) net settlement provisions, which in the case of convertible debt generally means the stock received upon conversion can be readily sold for cash. An embedded equity-linked component that meets the definition of a derivative does not have to be separated from the host instrument if the component qualifies for the scope exception for certain contracts involving an issuer's own equity. The scope exception applies if the contract is both a) indexed to its own stock; and b) classified in stockholders' equity in its statement of financial position.\nIf the conversion feature within convertible debt meets the requirements to be treated as a derivative, we estimate the fair value of the convertible debt derivative using Black-Scholes upon the date of issuance. If the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is higher than the face value of the convertible debt, the excess is immediately recognized as interest expense. Otherwise, the fair value of the convertible debt derivative is recorded as a liability with an offsetting amount recorded as a debt discount, which offsets the carrying amount of the debt. The convertible debt derivative is revalued at the end of each reporting period and any change in fair value is recorded as a gain or loss in the statement of operations. The debt discount is amortized through interest expense over the life of the debt.\nConvertible debt - beneficial conversion feature - If the conversion feature is not treated as a derivative, we assess whether it is a beneficial conversion feature ( BCF'). A BCF exists if the conversion price of the convertible debt instrument is less than the stock price on the commitment date. This typically occurs when the conversion price is less than the fair value of the stock on the date the instrument was issued. The value of a BCF is equal to the intrinsic value of the feature, the difference between the conversion price and the common stock into which it is convertible, and is recorded as additional paid in capital and as a debt discount in the balance sheet. We amortize the balance over the life of the underlying debt as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations. If the debt is retired early, the associated debt discount is then recognized immediately as amortization of debt discount expense in the statement of operations.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td>35 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf the conversion feature does not qualify for either the derivative treatment or as a BCF, the convertible debt is treated as traditional debt.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which provides guidance regarding management's responsibility to assess whether substantial doubt exists regarding the ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). This ASU is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. We do not expect that the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our financial position, operations, or cash flows.\nIn June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.\u201d This ASU removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition, the ASU eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. In addition, ASU 2014-10 requires an entity that has not commenced principal operations to provide disclosures about the risks and uncertainties related to the activities in which the entity is currently engaged and an understanding of what those activities are being directed toward. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. We have elected to adopt this ASU and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development stage disclosures. Adoption of this ASU did not impact our financial position, operations or cash flows.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU 2014-09, which will update Codification topic: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Management is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\u201d. This standard update requires an entity to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability as opposed to an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within those periods) beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued, and the new guidance would be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. Adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position, operations or cash flows.\nFuture Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no future contractual obligations and commitments. Future contractual obligations and commitments are based on the terms of the relevant agreements and appropriate classification of items under U.S. GAAP as currently in effect. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>36 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe incur contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations include future cash payments required under existing contracts, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related operating activities. Details on these obligations are set forth below.\nConvertible Note Payable\nOn December 23, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with respect to the sale and issuance to certain institutional investors Alpha Capital Anstalt and Brio Capital Master Fund Ltd. (collectively Purchasers\u201d) of up to (i) 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (the Incentive Shares\u201d); (ii) $862,500 aggregate principal amount of Secured Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) and (iii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,187,542 shares of our Common Stock (the Warrants\u201d). The Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants were issued on December 23, 2015 (the Original Issue Date\u201d). Purchasers received (i) Incentive Shares at the rate of 2.8986 Incentive Shares for each $1.00 of Note principal issued to such Purchaser; (ii) a Note with a principal amount of $1.00 for each $0.86956 for each $1.00 paid by each purchaser for such purchaser's Note; and (iii) Warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12 ( Purchaser Conversion Price\u201d), the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment. The aggregate cash subscription amount received by the Company from the purchasers for the issuance of the Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants was approximately $724,500 (the Subscription Amount\u201d) which was issued at a $138,000 discount from the face value of the Note.\nIn addition, the Notes provide that commencing six (6) months after the Original Issue Date, we will have the option of prepaying the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (an Optional Redemption\u201d), in whole or in part, by paying to the holders a sum of money in cash equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the holder arising under the Note through the Redemption Payment Date and 2.8986 shares of our Common Stock for each $1.00 of Note principal amount being redeemed. A Notice of Redemption, if given, may be given on the first Trading Day following twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days during which all of the Equity Conditions\u201d, as defined, have been in effect.\nEmployment Agreements\nWe previously had a consulting agreement with our CEO under which he was compensated $120,000 per annum. Beginning June 20, 2013, this contract was to continue unless and until terminated at any time by either us or CEO giving two month notice in writing. Such consulting agreement was terminated by mutual agreement as of May 1, 2015 and superseded by the employment agreement effective May 1, 2015. The initial term of the employment agreement expires on December 31, 2018, unless earlier terminated by us or Director. The agreement provides for automatic one-year renewals, unless either we or Director give notice of our or his intention not to extend at least 90 days prior to the expiration of any term. In addition, Director will receive a minimum annual base salary of $180,000, is eligible to receive an annual performance bonus each year, if performance goals established by our board of directors are met, and is entitled to participate in customary benefit plans. There have been no performance goals established. If we terminate Director's employment without cause, he will be entitled to the following: (i) payment of (x) accrued compensation and unpaid base salary through the date of such termination, (y) any amounts previously deferred by Director and (z) the payment or reimbursement for expenses incurred prior to the date of such termination; (ii) an amount equal to 200% of the base salary and (iii) continued participation, at our expense, in our health and welfare programs for a period of two years after the date of termination. We incurred compensation expense of $120,000 and $0 and consulting fees of $45,000 and $120,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Deferred compensation totaling $349,000 and $184,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in Accrued Compensation-Related Party.\nWe previously had a consulting agreement with our secretary and director ( Secretary\u201d) under which she was compensated $60,000 per annum. Beginning June 20, 2013, this contract was to continue unless and until terminated at any time by either us or Secretary giving two month notice in writing. Such consulting agreement was terminated by mutual agreement as of May 1, 2015 and superseded by the employment agreement effective May 1, 2015. The initial term of the employment agreement expires on December 31, 2018, unless earlier terminated by us or Secretary. The agreement provides for automatic one-year renewals, unless either we or Secretary give notice of our or his intention not to extend at least 90 days prior to the expiration of any term. In addition, Secretary will receive a minimum annual base salary of $80,000. If we terminate Secretary's employment without cause, she will be entitled to the following: (i) payment of (x) accrued compensation and unpaid base salary through the date of such termination, (y) any amounts previously deferred by Director and (z) the payment or reimbursement for expenses incurred prior to the date of such termination; (ii) an amount equal to 50% of the base salary and (iii) continued participation, at our expense, in our health and welfare programs for a period of two years after the date of termination. We incurred compensation expense of $53,333 and $0 and consulting fees of $21,667 and $60,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Deferred compensation totaling $167,000 and $92,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is included in Accrued Compensation-Related Party.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated under which it has:\nTable 90: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>an obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument; or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>an obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed discussion and analysis of Reign Sapphire Corporation's financial condition, historical development, recent developments, financing transactions, stock transactions, and plan of operations. The company, established in 2014, focuses on a vertically integrated model for sapphires, from rough stones to finished jewelry. It has developed relationships with commercial miners in Australia, and outsources the processing of rough sapphires to facilities in Asia. The company plans to launch two inaugural collections and intends to market to U.S. households with income levels of $60,000 to $100,000 and $100,000 and greater.

Pursuant to Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, we may take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, meaning that we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have chosen to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies to delay adoption of such standards until such standards are made applicable to private companies.

We outsource the processing of the rough material to facilities in Asia that meet our quality and ethical criteria and standards, We engage the services of a quality control specialist based in Asia to assist in this process. The outsourced processing includes sorting rough parcels of sapphires and cutting and polishing rough stones. We believe that consumers will appreciate that our sapphires come from a verified source and are processed under our oversight and supervision.\nWe started as UWI Holdings Corporation (previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation) ( UWI\u201d) and was established on May 31, 2013 in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada and listed on the GXG Markets in the UK.\nOn December 31, 2014, UWI entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations with us, pursuant to which UWI transferred all of its net assets to us. The sole shareholder of UWI along with his spouse retained 100% ownership of Reign and were issued 27,845,000 of Reign common shares in exchange for the 16,000,250 outstanding shares of UWI. There was no significant tax consequence to this exchange. As a result, we are considered to be the continuation of the predecessor UWI.

On December 31, 2014, UWI entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations with Reign, pursuant to which UWI transferred all of its net assets to Reign. The sole shareholder of UWI along with his spouse retained 100% ownership of Reign and were issued 27,845,000 of Reign common shares in exchange for the 16,000,250 outstanding shares of UWI. There was no significant tax consequence to this exchange. As a result, Reign is considered to be the continuation of the predecessor UWI. All historical financial information prior to the reorganization is that of UWI. While UWI was previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d, the Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d referred to elsewhere in this filing as a current shareholder of the Company is a different entity, a California corporation, formed by Mr. Segelman to hold shares of the Company engage in gemstone marketing consultancy.\nPrior to the reorganization, our Articles of Incorporation authorized the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.0001, with each share of common stock entitled to one vote for all matters on which a shareholder vote is required or requested. We were also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having a par value of $0.0001. On May 8, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number of common shares to 100,000,000 and the authorized number of preferred shares to 10,000,000.

(collectively Purchasers\u201d) of up to (i) 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (the Incentive Shares\u201d); (ii) $862,500 aggregate principal amount of Secured Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) and (iii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,187,542 shares of our Common Stock (the Warrants\u201d). The Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants were issued on December 23, 2015 (the Original Issue Date\u201d). Purchasers received (i) Incentive Shares at the rate of 2.8986 Incentive Shares for each $1.00 of Note principal issued to such Purchaser; (ii) a Note with a principal amount of $1.00 for each $0.86956 for each $1.00 paid by each purchaser for such purchaser's Note; and (iii) Warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12 ( Purchaser Conversion Price\u201d), the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment. The aggregate cash subscription amount received by us from the purchasers for the issuance of the Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants was approximately $724,500 (the Subscription Amount\u201d) which was issued at a $138,000 discount from the face value of the Note.\n 19 \nThe Notes mature on June 23, 2017, eighteen (18) months after the Original Issue Date, and provide for interest to accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 15% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law after the occurrence of any event of default as provided in the Notes. At any time after the Original Issue Date, the holders, at their option, may convert the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest into shares of our Common Stock. The initial conversion price for the principal and interest in connection with voluntary conversions by a holder of a Note is $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein. Each Note, for example, is subject to adjustment upon certain events such as stock splits and has full ratchet anti-dilution protections for issuance of securities by us at a price that is lower than the conversion price. Each Note also contains certain negative covenants, including prohibitions on incurrence of indebtedness, liens, charter amendments, dividends, redemption. None of the holders of the Note have the right to convert any portion of their Note if it (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise. The Notes include customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of our Common Stock from trading. If such an event of default occurs, the holders of the Notes may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes and accrual of interest as described above. The Notes are collectively collateralized by substantially all of our assets and guarantees of payment of the Notes have also been delivered by Joseph Segelman, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Australian Sapphire Corporation ( ASC\u201d), a stockholder of the Company which is wholly-owned by Joseph Segelman, guaranteed payment of all amounts owed under the Notes, subject to the terms of such guaranty agreements.\nIn addition, until one year after the initial trading date of a Registration Statement which registers all then outstanding or issuable underlying shares, the Purchasers shall have the right to participate in an amount of subsequent financing equal to 100% of the Purchase Agreement.\nOptional Redemption\nThe Notes provide that commencing six (6) months after the Original Issue Date, we will have the option of prepaying the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (an Optional Redemption\u201d), in whole or in part, by paying to the holders a sum of money in cash equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the holder arising under the Note through the Redemption Payment Date and 2.8986 shares of our Common Stock for each $1.00 of Note principal amount being redeemed. A Notice of Redemption, if given, may be given on the first Trading Day following twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days during which all of the Equity Conditions\u201d, as defined, have been in effect.\nPurchaser Conversion\nThe Purchaser has the right at any time after the Original Issue Date until the outstanding balance of the Note has been paid in full, to convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into shares ( Purchaser Conversion Shares\u201d) of our common stock, of the portion of the outstanding balance being converted (the Conversion Amount\u201d) divided by the Purchaser Conversion Price of $0.12, subject to potential future adjustments described below. If the total outstanding balance of the Note were convertible as of December 31, 2015, the Note would have been convertible into 7,187,500 shares of our common stock.\nWe evaluated the note under the requirements of ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and concluded that the Note does not fall within the scope of ASC 480. We next evaluated the Note under the requirements of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the anti-dilution provision which reduces the Purchaser Conversion Price in the event of subsequent dilutive issuances by us below the Purchaser Conversion Price as described above, the Purchaser Conversion feature does not meet the definition of indexed to\u201d our stock, and the scope exception to ASC 815's derivative accounting provisions does not apply. We also evaluated the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and concluded that the Purchaser Conversion feature meets all of the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and therefore, the Purchaser Conversion feature meets the definition of an embedded derivative that should be separated from the note and accounted for as a derivative liability.\n 20 \nThe embedded derivative was recorded as a derivative liability on the Balance Sheet at its fair value of $88,983 at the date of issuance of the Note and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling incorporating the following inputs:\n\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be recorded in the Statements of Operations.\nPurchaser Warrants\nThe Purchaser Warrants allow the Purchaser to purchase up to a number of shares of common stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12, the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment.\nThe term of the Purchaser Warrants is at any time on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the Original Issue Date and on or prior to the five (5) year anniversary of the Initial Trading Date of our common stock on a Trading Market.\nThe exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants is $0.30 per share of our common stock, as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the antidilution provisions of the Purchaser Warrants.\nThe Purchaser Warrants are exercisable by the Purchaser in whole or in part, as either a cash exercise or as a cashless\u201d exercise.\nWe evaluated the Warrants under ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the antidilution provision, which reduces the Exercise Price and Conversion Price in the event of subsequent Dilutive Issuances, the Purchaser Warrants are not indexed to our common stock, and we determined that the Purchaser Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815. Accordingly, the Purchaser Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities in the Balance Sheet at their fair value of $439,107 at the date of issuance and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the Purchaser Warrants is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling, incorporating the following inputs:\n\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the Purchaser Warrants will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be reported in the Statements of Operations.\n 21 \nPurchaser Common Stock\nThe Purchasers were issued a total of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $625,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant).\nAt inception, the total proceeds $724,500 received by us for the Note, Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser Warrants, was allocated first to the Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities at their initial fair values determined at the issuance date. The difference between the full fair value of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities of $1,153,090 and the proceeds of $724,500 was recorded as $433,590 (including $5,000 paid by the CEO on our behalf) of interest expense in the Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nStock Transactions\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued a total of 618,000 restricted common shares, valued at $154,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for marketing, investor relations, and outside consulting services.\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued 10,000 restricted common shares, valued at $2,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of our CEO for marketing services.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to an unrelated third party, valued at $250,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) plus $10,000 cash for the purchase of two trademarks. The Company has recorded a total of $260,000 as intangible assets in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.\nIn February and March 2015, we issued an aggregate of 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $75,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for legal services associated with our initial public offering.\nIn February 2015, we issued 40,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $10,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered.\nOn December 30, 2014, we issued 1,200,000 restricted common shares to an unrelated third party for the purchase of inventory with an estimated fair market value of $300,000. We valued the shares based on the estimated fair market value of the inventory, which was more readily determinable than the fair value of the stock.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we issued 85,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $16,800 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we issued 400,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $64,400 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services to be rendered, recorded.\nOn December 31, 2014, the Company issued 25,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $6,250 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of the Company's CEO for services rendered.\nOn December 31, 2014, we issued 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $75,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for legal services associated with our initial public offering.\nStock Based Compensation\nOn May 1, 2015 ( Grant Date\u201d), we issued to our Chief Executive Officer and director ( CEO\u201d), options to purchase 10,000,000 shares of our common stock under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan\u201d), valued at $2,500,000 (based on the Black Scholes valuation model on the Grant Date). We recognized expense of $1,395,869 for the year ended December 31, 2015 within stock based compensation - related party in the accompanying Statement of Operations.\nLimited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital\nThere is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. To date, we have not generated significant revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available we may be unable to continue operations.\n 22 \nOverview of Presentation\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) or Plan of Operations includes the following sections:\n \u00b7 Plan of Operations \n \u00b7 Results of Operations \n \u00b7 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u00b7 Capital Expenditures \n \u00b7 Going Concern \n \u00b7 Critical Accounting Policies \n \u00b7 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nPlan of Operations\nReign Sapphire Corporation was established as a vertically integrated miners-gate to retail\u201d model for sapphires-rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires. We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.\nThe processing of our rough Australian sapphires is done at our contract cutting factories in Asia and includes sorting rough parcels of sapphires and cutting and polishing rough stones. The processing and manufacturing costs are part of inventory costs in the use of proceeds section of this document.\nReign Sapphires is our color gemstone brand and we intend to launch our inaugural jewelry collection via our website www.reignsapphires.com in the second calendar quarter of 2016. The sample jewelry collection has been designed and manufactured and is ready for production.\nOur core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our initial jewelry collections. The Company has sufficient inventory to launch the sample collection.\nThe design direction for the collection we intend to offer is reflective of old Hollywood glamour meeting turn of the century. The inaugural collections we intend to offer are Reign Day-to-Night; featuring classic & timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet; featuring bold designs, made for the stars to hold a time and place in Hollywood's history.\nWe intend to position Reign Sapphires as a premium brand in the price point and company of competitors such as Cartier; Harry Winston; Roberto Coin; Van Cleef & Arpels and Bvlgari. We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong E-commerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust & recognition. However, we intend to set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.\n 23 \nThe Company intends to focus its marketing initiatives on: (1) Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) marketing to attract customers to the reignsapphires.com website, (2) Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d) marketing and sales efforts, to establish exclusive distribution partners, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level.\nThe Company's intends to launch a collection that includes rings, bracelets, and necklaces; featuring predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut sapphire melees. The Company intends to market the Red Carpet collection to households with annual income of $100,000 and greater and the Day-to-Night collection to households with income of $60,000 to $100,000.\nThe Company intends to initially focus marketing efforts in the U.S. and upon encountering three years of year on year growth in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, the Company intends to expand its retail marketing efforts internationally.\nWe believe that the cutting factories have sufficient capabilities to process the rough material required to supply the jewelry manufacturer with orders for our inaugural collection. We have prepared the CAD renderings, castings and molds required to mass-produce our jewelry. We have completed our market research and have retained the services of a publicist and marketing specialist to launch and promote Reign Sapphires, we have also identified the approximate location of our initial flagship location.\nWe will require a minimum of $2,500,000 to implement the business plan and intend to raise the additional funds needed to implement this plan but have no agreement in place or plans in place to raise such funds.\nStrategy\nReign Sapphire Corporation intends to set itself apart from its competition by marketing three core offerings: a vertically integrated direct from the miners-gate to retail model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.\nWe intend to promote Reign Sapphires as conflict free, ethically processed and natural. We also intend to make video footage and pictures of the process available to consumers via our website www.reignsapphires.com.\nThe Company intends to focus primarily on the conflict free, procured from a verified source element well as quality and design.\nProducts\nThe Company's intends to launch two inaugural collections: Reign Day-to-Night; featuring classic & timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet; featuring bold designs, made for the stars to hold a time and place in Hollywood's history. The company intends to include in these collections rings, bracelets, and necklaces; using predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut sapphire melees.\nMarket Opportunities & Marketing Strategy\nThe Company intends to market the Red Carpet collection to households with annual income of $100,000 and greater and the Day-to-Night collection to households with income of $60,000 to $100,000.\nDemand for the industry's products is largely driven by the needs and preferences of consumers, along with variations in the level of disposable income allocated toward their purchases. The Company intends to eventually also capitalize on fashion market opportunities by having a lower price point silver jewelry collection.\nThe Company intends to focus its marketing initiatives on: (1) Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) marketing to attract customers to the reignsapphires.com website, (2) Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d) marketing and sales efforts, to establish distribution partners such as high-end fashion retailers, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level. The Company intends to initially focus marketing efforts in the U.S. and upon encountering three years of year on year growth in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, the Company intends to expand its marketing efforts internationally.\n 24 \nThe Company intends to attract retail customers to the reignsapphires.com website by spreading awareness of the company and its offerings by engaging the services of a digital marketing specialist and social media specialist. The company also intends to hire a publicist as well as a marketing and branding specialist to manage print advertising campaigns and seasonal promotional activities. The Company intends to identify ideal locations for retail flagship stores that contain a large volume of walk-by traffic in communities with upper income residents.\nThe Company intends to form limited wholesale partnerships with retailers to sell the products at their retail boutiques, the benefit to Reign Sapphires is the promotion of the Company brand at the consumer level until we are in a position to open our own flagship stores. Prior to launching the Company's sales campaign, the Company intends to develop and use association strategy to identify appropriate and strategic partners for co-marketing opportunities.\nPlan of Operations\nAs of the date of this filing, we have generated minimal revenue by selling loose finished gemstones to a number of wholesale customers. We currently have no operational retail website and no retail customers, our activities and operations have been limited to developing our business and financial plans as well as designing and sample manufacturing our inaugural collection which we intend to launch together with our retail website in the second calendar quarter of 2016. We will not have the necessary capital to fully execute the first phase of our business plan until we are able to secure financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. Even if we raise such financing, we may not have sufficient capital to begin generating further revenues from operations.\nWe had no significant operating revenues through December 31, 2015. We expect to have operating revenues in the first half of 2016 as we launch our B2C marketing initiative. Revenues will be predominately the result of fine jewelry sales. At December 31, 2015 our cash balance was negligible.\nOur plan of operations consists of:\n \u00b7 Purchase rough sapphires from commercial miners in Australian and process the rough material into cut gemstones and finished jewelry. \n \u00b7 Launch of our B2B marketing and sales efforts through the use of distribution partners and a high-end fashion retailers. \n \u00b7 Launch of our B2C marketing and sales efforts through the use of Internet marketing, print advertising, promotions, and signage ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

The outsourced processing includes sorting rough parcels of sapphires and cutting and polishing rough stones. We believe that consumers will appreciate that our sapphires come from a verified source and are processed under our oversight and supervision.\nWe started as UWI Holdings Corporation (previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation) ( UWI\u201d) and was established on May 31, 2013 in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada and listed on the GXG Markets in the UK.\nOn December 31, 2014, UWI entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations with us, pursuant to which UWI transferred all of its net assets to us. The sole shareholder of UWI along with his spouse retained 100% ownership of Reign and were issued 27,845,000 of Reign common shares in exchange for the 16,000,250 outstanding shares of UWI. There was no significant tax consequence to this exchange. As a result, we are considered to be the continuation of the predecessor UWI. All historical financial information prior to the reorganization is that of UWI.

On May 8, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number common shares to 100,000,000 and authorized number of preferred shares to 10,000,000. On December 22, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number common shares to 150,000,000 with the authorized number of preferred shares remaining at 10,000,000.\nFor share and earnings per share information, we have retroactively restated per share and the outstanding shares for weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods presented, as a result of the reorganizations.\nWe began our planned principal operations, and accordingly, we have prepared our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d).\nRecent Developments\nFinancing Transactions\nWe started as UWI (previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation), which was established on May 31, 2013 in the Province of New Brunswick, Canada. On December 31, 2014, UWI entered into an Agreement of Conveyance, Transfer and Assignment of Assets and Assumption of Obligations with Reign, pursuant to which UWI transferred all of its net assets to Reign. The sole shareholder of UWI along with his spouse retained 100% ownership of Reign and were issued 27,845,000 of Reign common shares in exchange for the 16,000,250 outstanding shares of UWI. There was no significant tax consequence to this exchange. As a result, Reign is considered to be the continuation of the predecessor UWI. All historical financial information prior to the reorganization is that of UWI. While UWI was previously known as Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d, the Australian Sapphire Corporation\u201d referred to elsewhere in this filing as a current shareholder of the Company is a different entity, a California corporation, formed by Mr. Segelman to hold shares of the Company engage in gemstone marketing consultancy.\nPrior to the reorganization, our Articles of Incorporation authorized the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.0001, with each share of common stock entitled to one vote for all matters on which a shareholder vote is required or requested. We were also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having a par value of $0.0001. On May 8, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number of common shares to 100,000,000 and the authorized number of preferred shares to 10,000,000. On December 22, 2015, our certificate of incorporation was amended to increase the authorized number common shares to 150,000,000 with the authorized number of preferred shares remaining at 10,000,000.\nFor share and earnings per share information, we have retroactively restated per share and the outstanding shares for weighted average shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods presented, as a result of the reorganizations.\nOur Board of Directors are authorized to provide for the issue of any and all of the unissued and undesignated shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each series, such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designation, preferences, and relative, participating, optional, or other rights and qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereof, as shall be stated an expressed in the resolution adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares and as may be permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn December 23, 2015, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with respect to the sale and issuance to certain institutional investors Alpha Capital Anstalt and Brio Capital Master Fund Ltd. (collectively Purchasers\u201d) of up to (i) 2,500,000 shares of our Common Stock (the Incentive Shares\u201d); (ii) $862,500 aggregate principal amount of Secured Convertible Notes (the Notes\u201d) and (iii) Common Stock Purchase Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,187,542 shares of our Common Stock (the Warrants\u201d). The Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants were issued on December 23, 2015 (the Original Issue Date\u201d). Purchasers received (i) Incentive Shares at the rate of 2.8986 Incentive Shares for each $1.00 of Note principal issued to such Purchaser; (ii) a Note with a principal amount of $1.00 for each $0.86956 for each $1.00 paid by each purchaser for such purchaser's Note; and (iii) Warrants to purchase up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12 ( Purchaser Conversion Price\u201d), the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment. The aggregate cash subscription amount received by us from the purchasers for the issuance of the Incentive Shares, Notes and Warrants was approximately $724,500 (the Subscription Amount\u201d) which was issued at a $138,000 discount from the face value of the Note.\n 19 \nThe Notes mature on June 23, 2017, eighteen (18) months after the Original Issue Date, and provide for interest to accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 15% per annum or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law after the occurrence of any event of default as provided in the Notes. At any time after the Original Issue Date, the holders, at their option, may convert the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest into shares of our Common Stock. The initial conversion price for the principal and interest in connection with voluntary conversions by a holder of a Note is $0.12 per share, subject to adjustment as provided therein. Each Note, for example, is subject to adjustment upon certain events such as stock splits and has full ratchet anti-dilution protections for issuance of securities by us at a price that is lower than the conversion price. Each Note also contains certain negative covenants, including prohibitions on incurrence of indebtedness, liens, charter amendments, dividends, redemption. None of the holders of the Note have the right to convert any portion of their Note if it (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 9.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise. The Notes include customary events of default, including, among other things, payment defaults, covenant breaches, certain representations and warranties, certain events of bankruptcy, liquidation and suspension of our Common Stock from trading. If such an event of default occurs, the holders of the Notes may be entitled to take various actions, which may include the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes and accrual of interest as described above. The Notes are collectively collateralized by substantially all of our assets and guarantees of payment of the Notes have also been delivered by Joseph Segelman, the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Australian Sapphire Corporation ( ASC\u201d), a stockholder of the Company which is wholly-owned by Joseph Segelman, guaranteed payment of all amounts owed under the Notes, subject to the terms of such guaranty agreements.\nIn addition, until one year after the initial trading date of a Registration Statement which registers all then outstanding or issuable underlying shares, the Purchasers shall have the right to participate in an amount of subsequent financing equal to 100% of the Purchase Agreement.\nOptional Redemption\nThe Notes provide that commencing six (6) months after the Original Issue Date, we will have the option of prepaying the outstanding principal amount of the Notes (an Optional Redemption\u201d), in whole or in part, by paying to the holders a sum of money in cash equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the principal amount to be redeemed, together with accrued but unpaid interest thereon, if any, and any and all other sums due, accrued or payable to the holder arising under the Note through the Redemption Payment Date and 2.8986 shares of our Common Stock for each $1.00 of Note principal amount being redeemed. A Notice of Redemption, if given, may be given on the first Trading Day following twenty (20) consecutive Trading Days during which all of the Equity Conditions\u201d, as defined, have been in effect.\nPurchaser Conversion\nThe Purchaser has the right at any time after the Original Issue Date until the outstanding balance of the Note has been paid in full, to convert all or any part of the outstanding balance into shares ( Purchaser Conversion Shares\u201d) of our common stock, of the portion of the outstanding balance being converted (the Conversion Amount\u201d) divided by the Purchaser Conversion Price of $0.12, subject to potential future adjustments described below. If the total outstanding balance of the Note were convertible as of December 31, 2015, the Note would have been convertible into 7,187,500 shares of our common stock.\nWe evaluated the note under the requirements of ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and concluded that the Note does not fall within the scope of ASC 480. We next evaluated the Note under the requirements of ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the anti-dilution provision which reduces the Purchaser Conversion Price in the event of subsequent dilutive issuances by us below the Purchaser Conversion Price as described above, the Purchaser Conversion feature does not meet the definition of indexed to\u201d our stock, and the scope exception to ASC 815's derivative accounting provisions does not apply. We also evaluated the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and concluded that the Purchaser Conversion feature meets all of the embedded derivative criteria in ASC 815, and therefore, the Purchaser Conversion feature meets the definition of an embedded derivative that should be separated from the note and accounted for as a derivative liability.\n 20 \nThe embedded derivative was recorded as a derivative liability on the Balance Sheet at its fair value of $88,983 at the date of issuance of the Note and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the embedded derivative liability is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling incorporating the following inputs:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>0.47% - 0.86% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 - 1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Conversion price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.12 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be recorded in the Statements of Operations.\nPurchaser Warrants\nThe Purchaser Warrants allow the Purchaser to purchase up to a number of shares of common stock equal to 100% of such purchaser's Note principal amount divided by $0.12, the conversion price in effect on the Initial Closing Date, with a per share exercise price equal to $0.30, subject to adjustment.\nThe term of the Purchaser Warrants is at any time on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the Original Issue Date and on or prior to the five (5) year anniversary of the Initial Trading Date of our common stock on a Trading Market.\nThe exercise price of the Purchaser Warrants is $0.30 per share of our common stock, as may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the antidilution provisions of the Purchaser Warrants.\nThe Purchaser Warrants are exercisable by the Purchaser in whole or in part, as either a cash exercise or as a cashless\u201d exercise.\nWe evaluated the Warrants under ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities From Equity\u201d and ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging\u201d. Due to the existence of the antidilution provision, which reduces the Exercise Price and Conversion Price in the event of subsequent Dilutive Issuances, the Purchaser Warrants are not indexed to our common stock, and we determined that the Purchaser Warrants meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815. Accordingly, the Purchaser Warrants were recorded as derivative liabilities in the Balance Sheet at their fair value of $439,107 at the date of issuance and at December 31, 2015 as any change in the fair value was deemed immaterial. The fair value of the Purchaser Warrants is measured in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement\u201d, using monte carlo simulation\u201d modeling, incorporating the following inputs:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td>0.00% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected stock-price volatility </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td>1.74% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term of options (years) </td> <td> </td> <td>.5 - 1.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.25 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exercise price </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each subsequent reporting date, the fair value of the Purchaser Warrants will be remeasured and changes in the fair value will be reported in the Statements of Operations.\n 21 \nPurchaser Common Stock\nThe Purchasers were issued a total of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $625,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant).\nAt inception, the total proceeds $724,500 received by us for the Note, Purchaser Common Stock, and Purchaser Warrants, was allocated first to the Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities at their initial fair values determined at the issuance date. The difference between the full fair value of Purchaser Common Stock, Purchaser Warrants, and embedded derivative liabilities of $1,153,090 and the proceeds of $724,500 was recorded as $433,590 (including $5,000 paid by the CEO on our behalf) of interest expense in the Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nStock Transactions\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued a total of 618,000 restricted common shares, valued at $154,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for marketing, investor relations, and outside consulting services.\nOn July 15, 2015, we issued 10,000 restricted common shares, valued at $2,500 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of our CEO for marketing services.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to an unrelated third party, valued at $250,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) plus $10,000 cash for the purchase of two trademarks. The Company has recorded a total of $260,000 as intangible assets in the accompanying Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015.\nIn February and March 2015, we issued an aggregate of 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $75,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for legal services associated with our initial public offering.\nIn February 2015, we issued 40,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $10,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered.\nOn December 30, 2014, we issued 1,200,000 restricted common shares to an unrelated third party for the purchase of inventory with an estimated fair market value of $300,000. We valued the shares based on the estimated fair market value of the inventory, which was more readily determinable than the fair value of the stock.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we issued 85,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $16,800 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services rendered.\nIn fiscal year 2014, we issued 400,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $64,400 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to outside consultants for services to be rendered, recorded.\nOn December 31, 2014, the Company issued 25,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $6,250 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) to a Brother-in-law of the Company's CEO for services rendered.\nOn December 31, 2014, we issued 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $75,000 (based on the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant) for legal services associated with our initial public offering.\nStock Based Compensation\nOn May 1, 2015 ( Grant Date\u201d), we issued to our Chief Executive Officer and director ( CEO\u201d), options to purchase 10,000,000 shares of our common stock under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan\u201d), valued at $2,500,000 (based on the Black Scholes valuation model on the Grant Date). We recognized expense of $1,395,869 for the year ended December 31, 2015 within stock based compensation - related party in the accompanying Statement of Operations.\nLimited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital\nThere is limited historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. To date, we have not generated significant revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available we may be unable to continue operations.\n 22 \nOverview of Presentation\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD&A\u201d) or Plan of Operations includes the following sections:\n \u00b7 Plan of Operations \n \u00b7 Results of Operations \n \u00b7 Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \u00b7 Capital Expenditures \n \u00b7 Going Concern \n \u00b7 Critical Accounting Policies \n \u00b7 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements \nPlan of Operations\nReign Sapphire Corporation was established as a vertically integrated miners-gate to retail\u201d model for sapphires-rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires. We are not an exploration or mining company and are not engaged in exploration or mining activities. We purchase rough sapphires in bulk, directly from commercial miners in Australia, and we intend to oversee each step of the process as the stones go from the miners-gate to the consumer as Reign Sapphire jewelry.\nThe processing of our rough Australian sapphires is done at our contract cutting factories in Asia and includes sorting rough parcels of sapphires and cutting and polishing rough stones. The processing and manufacturing costs are part of inventory costs in the use of proceeds section of this document.\nReign Sapphires is our color gemstone brand and we intend to launch our inaugural jewelry collection via our website www.reignsapphires.com in the second calendar quarter of 2016. The sample jewelry collection has been designed and manufactured and is ready for production.\nOur core values are to offer consumers conflict free sapphires; sapphires that are mined from a verified source; sapphires that have been procured directly from miners, sapphires that are ethically processed and sapphires that are natural (not synthetic). In addition, we intend to feature exclusively Australian sapphires in our initial jewelry collections. The Company has sufficient inventory to launch the sample collection.\nThe design direction for the collection we intend to offer is reflective of old Hollywood glamour meeting turn of the century. The inaugural collections we intend to offer are Reign Day-to-Night; featuring classic & timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet; featuring bold designs, made for the stars to hold a time and place in Hollywood's history.\nWe intend to position Reign Sapphires as a premium brand in the price point and company of competitors such as Cartier; Harry Winston; Roberto Coin; Van Cleef & Arpels and Bvlgari. We believe that our competitors have certain existing advantages such as history and heritage; strong E-commerce and mobile presence; wholesale and flagship retail presence; strong social presence; a wide range of ancillary product offerings; strong public relations and marketing efforts; a balanced range of price points across the board; and consumer trust & recognition. However, we intend to set ourselves apart with strong brand identity and visuals, unique design and quality and brand awareness through traditional and social media.\n 23 \nThe Company intends to focus its marketing initiatives on: (1) Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) marketing to attract customers to the reignsapphires.com website, (2) Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d) marketing and sales efforts, to establish exclusive distribution partners, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level.\nThe Company's intends to launch a collection that includes rings, bracelets, and necklaces; featuring predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut sapphire melees. The Company intends to market the Red Carpet collection to households with annual income of $100,000 and greater and the Day-to-Night collection to households with income of $60,000 to $100,000.\nThe Company intends to initially focus marketing efforts in the U.S. and upon encountering three years of year on year growth in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, the Company intends to expand its retail marketing efforts internationally.\nWe believe that the cutting factories have sufficient capabilities to process the rough material required to supply the jewelry manufacturer with orders for our inaugural collection. We have prepared the CAD renderings, castings and molds required to mass-produce our jewelry. We have completed our market research and have retained the services of a publicist and marketing specialist to launch and promote Reign Sapphires, we have also identified the approximate location of our initial flagship location.\nWe will require a minimum of $2,500,000 to implement the business plan and intend to raise the additional funds needed to implement this plan but have no agreement in place or plans in place to raise such funds.\nStrategy\nReign Sapphire Corporation intends to set itself apart from its competition by marketing three core offerings: a vertically integrated direct from the miners-gate to retail model for sapphires - rough sapphires to finished jewelry; a color gemstone brand; and a jewelry brand featuring Australian sapphires.\nWe intend to promote Reign Sapphires as conflict free, ethically processed and natural. We also intend to make video footage and pictures of the process available to consumers via our website www.reignsapphires.com.\nThe Company intends to focus primarily on the conflict free, procured from a verified source element well as quality and design.\nProducts\nThe Company's intends to launch two inaugural collections: Reign Day-to-Night; featuring classic & timeless pieces designed to complement versus take over and Reign Red-Carpet; featuring bold designs, made for the stars to hold a time and place in Hollywood's history. The company intends to include in these collections rings, bracelets, and necklaces; using predominantly 1.5mm to 2.5mm diamond and princess cut sapphire melees.\nMarket Opportunities & Marketing Strategy\nThe Company intends to market the Red Carpet collection to households with annual income of $100,000 and greater and the Day-to-Night collection to households with income of $60,000 to $100,000.\nDemand for the industry's products is largely driven by the needs and preferences of consumers, along with variations in the level of disposable income allocated toward their purchases. The Company intends to eventually also capitalize on fashion market opportunities by having a lower price point silver jewelry collection.\nThe Company intends to focus its marketing initiatives on: (1) Business-to-Consumer ( B2C\u201d) marketing to attract customers to the reignsapphires.com website, (2) Business-to-Business ( B2B\u201d) marketing and sales efforts, to establish distribution partners such as high-end fashion retailers, and eventually (3) building a strong retail presence to market the products directly to consumers on a retail level. The Company intends to initially focus marketing efforts in the U.S. and upon encountering three years of year on year growth in the U.S. with online, wholesale, and retail sales, the Company intends to expand its marketing efforts internationally.\n 24 \nThe Company intends to attract retail customers to the reignsapphires.com website by spreading awareness of the company and its offerings by engaging the services of a digital marketing specialist and social media specialist. The company also intends to hire a publicist as well as a marketing and branding specialist to manage print advertising campaigns and seasonal promotional activities. The Company intends to identify ideal locations for retail flagship stores that contain a large volume of walk-by traffic in communities with upper income residents.\nThe Company intends to form limited wholesale partnerships with retailers to sell the products at their retail boutiques, the benefit to Reign Sapphires is the promotion of the Company brand at the consumer level until we are in a position to open our own flagship stores. Prior to launching the Company's sales campaign, the Company intends to develop and use association strategy to identify appropriate and strategic partners for co-marketing opportunities.\nPlan of Operations\nAs of the date of this filing, we have generated minimal revenue by selling loose finished gemstones to a number of wholesale customers. We currently have no operational retail website and no retail customers, our activities and operations have been limited to developing our business and financial plans as well as designing and sample manufacturing our inaugural collection which we intend to launch together with our retail website in the second calendar quarter of 2016. We will not have the necessary capital to fully execute the first phase of our business plan until we are able to secure financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on suitable terms. Even if we raise such financing, we may not have sufficient capital to begin generating further revenues from operations.\nWe had no significant operating revenues through December 31, 2015. We expect to have operating revenues in the first half of 2016 as we launch our B2C marketing initiative. Revenues will be predominately the result of fine jewelry sales. At December 31, 2015 our cash balance was negligible.\nOur plan of operations consists of:\n \u00b7 Purchase rough sapphires from commercial miners in Australian and process the rough material into cut gemstones and finished jewelry. \n \u00b7 Launch of our B2B marketing and sales efforts through the use of distribution partners and a high-end fashion retailers. \n \u00b7 Launch of our B2C marketing and sales efforts through the use of Internet marketing, print advertising, promotions, and signage "}
