Through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our business was reported in nine operating segments: U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Latin America, EMEA, Asia and Payment Services. Changes in our management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2017 required us to conduct an assessment in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, to determine our operating segments.\nAs a result of this assessment, we now have the following operating segments:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North America\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>South America\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Rest of World.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior period information has been revised to reflect our current segment structure.\nWe believe that Brink's has significant competitive advantages including:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>track record of refining our business portfolio to deliver shareholder value\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>medium-term growth drivers from high-value services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>global footprint in a world with increasing security needs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>brand name recognition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>reputation for a high level of service and security\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>risk management and logistics expertise\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>value-based solutions expertise\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operational excellence\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe focus our time and resources on service quality, protecting and strengthening our brand, and addressing our risks. Our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the Brink's\u201d brand, so we seek to protect and build its value. Because our services focus on handling, transporting, protecting and managing valuables, we strive to understand and manage risk.\nIn order to earn an adequate return on capital, we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources in addition to our pricing discipline. We attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches, vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety, security or service.\nOperating results may vary from period to period. Because revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported, they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers. We also periodically incur costs to change the scale of our operations when volumes increase or decrease. Incremental costs incurred usually relate to increasing or decreasing the number of employees and increasing or decreasing branches or administrative facilities. In addition, security costs can vary depending on performance, the cost of insurance coverage, and changes in crime rates (i.e., attacks and robberies).\nBrink's revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnalysis of Results: 2017 versus 2016\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide an analysis of our operations below on both a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP basis. The purpose of the non-GAAP information is to report our operating profit, income from continuing operations and earnings per share without certain income and expense items that do not reflect the regular earnings of our operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. The non-GAAP adjustments used to reconcile our GAAP results are described in detail on pages 28-30 and are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures on pages 35-37.\nDefinition of Organic Growth Organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period excluding the effect of: acquisitions and dispositions and changes in currency exchange rates.

A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar ($400.8 million). Revenues increased 21% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Argentina (including the effects of inflation) and organic revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico driven by volume growth and price increases. See above for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues increased 9% to $2,608.2 million due the impact of acquisitions and inflation-based increases on labor and other operational costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Selling, general and administrative costs increased 10% to $468.2 million due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs driven by incentive-based compensation, partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $89.4 million due mainly to:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>organic increases in Venezuela ($115.8 million), South America ($52.6 million) and North America ($31.3 million), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($21.0 million),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>lower organic impact of costs from reorganization and restructuring actions and acquisition and disposition activities ($18.8 million) included in \"Other items not allocated to segments\",\n</td> </tr>\n</table> partially offset by:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($122.2 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher corporate expenses ($27.6 million on an organic basis) due to higher incentive-based compensation and security losses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2017 decreased $19.3 million to $16.9 million primarily due to higher income tax expense ($79.2 million) driven by U.S. tax reform, higher interest expense ($11.8 million), and higher interest and other income (expense) ($21.1 million). These items were partially offset by the operating profit increase mentioned above. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.33, down from $0.72 in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2017 versus 2016\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues increased $284.5 million primarily due to organic growth in South America ($134.7 million), North America ($33.2 million), and Rest of World ($18.1 million), as well as the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($70.4 million) and currency exchange rates ($28.1 million). The favorable currency impact was driven by the Brazilian real and the euro, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the Argentine peso. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Argentina (including the effects of inflation) and organic revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico driven by volume growth and price increases. See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $65.6 million due mainly to:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>organic increases in South America ($52.6 million) and North America ($31.3 million), and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($19.9 million),\n</td> </tr>\n</table> partially offset by:\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>higher corporate expenses ($27.6 million on an organic basis) due to higher incentive-based compensation and security losses, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($10.3 million).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2017 increased $41.6 million to $157.2 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($14.6 million) and higher interest expense ($10.7 million).

Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by price and volume growth in Mexico. Operating profit increased $33.9 million primarily due to organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico. Organic profit growth in the U.S. was driven by lower vehicle costs, labor and other productivity improvements, and lower security losses. Organic profit growth in Mexico was driven by productivity improvements.\nSouth America\nRevenues increased 29% ($205.9 million) primarily due to 19% organic growth ($134.7 million), the favorable impact of acquisitions ($63.7 million) and currency exchange rates ($7.5 million) mostly from the Brazilian real, partially offset by a decline in the Argentine peso. The organic growth was driven by inflation-based price increases in Argentina and increased volume growth and price increases in Brazil. Operating profit increased 49% ($60.2 million) driven by organic growth in Argentina and Brazil and the favorable impact of acquisitions ($16.0 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency ($8.4 million) driven by the Argentine peso.\nRest of World\nRevenues increased 4% ($34.7 million) due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates ($20.6 million), primarily from the euro, and 2% organic growth ($18.1 million). The organic revenue growth was driven by Greece and Asia, partially offset by a decrease in France due to pricing pressure. Operating profit increased 4% ($3.9 million) due to the favorable impact of currency ($2.2 million) and acquisitions and dispositions ($2.0 million). Organic growth was down slightly ($0.3 million) due to a decrease in France related to pricing pressure which was partially offset by growth in Asia.\nAnalysis of Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Results\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except for per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,020.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,061.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>2,391.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,443.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>424.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>184.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,908.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,976.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating profit\n</td> <td>215.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP income from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>115.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 35-37.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $40.8 million or 1% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($399.6 million), the impact of dispositions ($34.3 million), and an organic decrease in Rest of World ($3.4 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($226.4 million), South America ($124.7 million), and North America ($45.4 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar after February 2016. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the Mexican peso and most currencies in South America.

Organic growth was driven by volume increases in the U.S. and price and volume increases in Mexico, with U.S. volume growth driven by the increased sales of cash recyclers to a large retailer. Operating profit decreased $5.5 million due to unfavorable currency ($4.4 million) primarily from the Mexican peso and organic decreases in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. organic decline was due to higher fleet and insurance costs and the Canada decline was due to inflationary cost increases and lower organic revenue growth. These declines were partially offset by organic growth in the U.S. Payments business driven by revenue growth and lower marketing expenditures related to increasing cardholders.\nSouth America\nRevenues decreased $0.6 million as the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates ($125.3 million) was mostly offset by 17% organic growth ($124.7 million) driven by inflation-based revenue increases in Argentina and price increases in Brazil. Operating profit increased 17% ($18.0 million) primarily due to organic growth in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, partially offset by unfavorable currency ($31.3 million). The organic growth in Brazil was driven by a favorable tax ruling and productivity improvements.\nRest of World\nRevenues decreased 5% ($54.2 million) due to the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), unfavorable currency ($13.7 million), and organic decreases ($3.4 million). Organic revenue decreases were driven by lower BGS volumes, and lower revenue in France due to volume and pricing pressure and the loss of an airport guarding contract, partially offset by organic growth in Asia driven by Hong Kong and Singapore. Operating profit increased 9% ($8.8 million) due to organic growth ($5.5 million) and the favorable impact of dispositions ($4.2 million). The organic growth was driven by higher organic results in France due to growth in cash management services and a benefit recognized related to social charges, as well as organic growth in Asia due to revenue growth.\nIncome and Expense Not Allocated to Segments\nCorporate Expenses\nCorporate expenses include former non-segment and regional management costs, currency transaction gains and losses, and costs related to global initiatives.\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General, administrative and other expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(84.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(59.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(81.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transaction gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of segment policies to GAAP\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate items\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(90.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(58.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(85.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate expenses in 2017 were $32.4 million higher than the prior year primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and security losses recognized in corporate expenses. Corporate expenses include costs to manage the global business and to perform activities required of public companies, as well as currency transaction gains and losses.\nCorporate expenses in 2016 were $27.0 million lower than the prior year due to lower compensation-related expenses, along with the recognition of foreign currency transaction gains in 2016 compared to foreign currency transaction losses in 2015.\nOther Items Not Allocated to Segments\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and dispositions\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reorganization and Restructuring\n</td> <td>(22.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions and dispositions\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(73\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(76\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 versus 2016\nThe impact of other items not allocated to segments on operating profit was a smaller loss ($7.5 million in 2017 versus $31.3 million in the prior year). The change was primarily due to lower charges from acquisitions and dispositions in 2017 as the prior year included losses from Ireland operations exited in 2016 as well as a loss on the sale of corporate assets. In addition, the current year includes a gain on the sale of real estate in Mexico. These favorable items were partially offset by higher amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets, severance costs related to recent business acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil and transaction costs related to 2017 business acquisitions. Charges from reorganization and restructuring activities were lower in the current year and profit from Venezuela operations was higher in 2017.\n2016 versus 2015\nThe impact of other items not allocated to segments on operating profit was a smaller loss ($31.3 million in 2016 versus $71.1 million in the prior year period). The reduction was primarily due to the $35.3 million of Venezuela impairment charges recognized in the prior year period as well as lower losses related to currency devaluation in Venezuela in the current year period. The Venezuela-related items were partially offset by charges related to the shutdown of operations in Ireland, a loss on the sale of corporate assets and higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016.\nVenezuela operations We have excluded from our segment results all of our Venezuela operating results, including remeasurement losses on net monetary assets related to currency devaluations ($9.1 million in 2017, $4.8 million in 2016 and $18.1 million in 2015) and charges related to the impairment of property and equipment ($35.3 million in 2015), due to the Venezuelan government's restrictions that have prevented us from repatriating funds. In light of these unique circumstances, our operations in Venezuela are largely independent of the rest of our global operations. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer, the Company's Chief Operating Decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses segment performance and makes resource decisions by segment excluding Venezuela operating results. Additionally, management believes excluding Venezuela from segment results makes it possible to more effectively evaluate the company's performance between periods.\nFactors considered by management in excluding Venezuela results include:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued inability to repatriate cash to redeploy to other operations or dividend to shareholders\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Highly inflationary environment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fixed exchange rate policy\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued currency devaluations and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Difficulty raising prices and controlling costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReorganization and Restructuring\n2016 Restructuring\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions. As a result of these actions, we recognized $18.1 million in related 2016 costs. We recognized an additional $17.3 million in 2017 under this restructuring for additional costs related to severance, asset-related adjustments, a benefit program termination and lease terminations. Severance actions are expected to reduce our global workforce by 800 to 900 positions and result in approximately $20 million in annualized cost savings when this restructuring is finalized. We expect to incur additional costs between $10 and $12 million in future periods, primarily severance costs.\nExecutive Leadership and Board of Directors\nIn 2015, we recognized $1.8 million in charges related to Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring actions, which were announced in January 2016. We recognized $4.3 million in charges in 2016 related to the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring actions.\n2015 Restructuring\nBrink's initiated a global restructuring of its business in the third quarter of 2015. We recognized $11.6 million in 2015 costs related to employee severance, contract terminations, and property impairment. We recognized an additional $6.5 million in 2016 related to this restructuring for additional severance costs, contract terminations and lease terminations. The 2015 Reorganization and Restructuring reduced the global workforce by approximately 1,100 positions and resulted in approximately $20 million in 2016 savings. The actions under this program were substantially completed by the end of 2016, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $18 million.\n2014 Restructuring\nBrink's reorganized and restructured its business in December 2014, eliminating the management roles and structures in its former Latin America and EMEA regions and implementing a plan to reduce the cost structure of various country operations by eliminating approximately 1,700 positions across its global workforce. Severance costs of $21.8 million associated with these actions were recognized in 2014. An additional $1.9 million in costs were recognized in 2015 related to the 2014 restructuring. The restructuring saved annual direct costs of approximately $50 million in 2015 compared to 2014, excluding charges for severance, lease termination and accelerated depreciation.\nOther Restructurings\nManagement routinely implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business. As a result of these actions, we recognized related severance costs of $4.6 million in 2017. The majority of these restructuring actions were completed in 2017. The completed restructuring actions reduced our workforce by approximately 300 positions, which will result in $4 million in annualized cost savings. For the remaining restructuring actions, we expect to incur additional costs less than $1 million in future periods. These estimates will be updated as management targets additional sections of our business.\nDue to the unique circumstances around these charges, they have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non-GAAP results. Charges related to the employees, assets, leases and contracts impacted by these restructuring actions were excluded from the segments and corporate expenses as shown in the table below.

Certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non-GAAP results.

The change was primarily due to lower property impairment losses as the prior year included impairment charges resulting from the 2016 restructuring actions. In addition, we recognized an $8.4 million gain in 2017 related to the sale of real estate in Mexico. These positive factors were partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction losses in 2017, primarily from remeasurement losses associated with Venezuela currency devaluation ($9.1 million in 2017 versus $4.8 million in 2016) .\n2016 versus 2015\nOther operating expense decreased in 2016 primarily due to lower losses from foreign currency items, property impairments, Argentina currency conversions and business dispositions. The reduction in foreign currency transaction losses mainly resulted from lower remeasurement losses associated with Venezuelan currency devaluation ($4.8 million in 2016 versus $18.1 million in 2015). Impairment charges declined in 2016 as the 2015 Venezuela property impairment of $35.3 million exceeded current year impairment losses, primarily from 2016 restructuring actions. After the December 2015 devaluation of the Argentine peso, we did not incur significant losses from converting Argentina pesos to U.S. dollars ($0.1 million in 2016 versus $7.1 million in 2015). In 2015, we recognized a $5.9 million loss on the sale of a Russian cash management business.\nNonoperating Income and Expense\nInterest Expense\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense was higher in 2017 due to higher borrowing levels used to finance 2017 and future business acquisitions.\nInterest expense was higher in 2016 due to interest recognized on a non-recourse financing liability in Mexico (see Note 19) and the impact of higher weighted-average interest rates in 2016 versus the prior year.\nInterest and Other Income (Expense)\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on available-for-sale securities\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency transaction losses\n</td> <td>(7.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Derivative instruments\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retirement benefit cost other than service cost\n</td> <td>(47.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepayment penalties(a)\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Brazil tax claim(b)\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>unfav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expense)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(60.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Penalties upon prepayment of Private Placement notes in September 2017 and a term loan in October 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Related to an unfavorable court ruling in 2017 on a non-income tax claim in Brazil.

The Tax Reform Act includes a reduction in the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% as of January 1, 2018, a one-time transition tax on the cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, a repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, and more extensive limitations on deductibility of performance-based compensation for named executive officers. Other provisions effective as of January 1, 2018, which could materially impact the Company in the near-term, include the creation of a new U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings called the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI\u201d) and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense.\nDue to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Reform Act, the Company has recorded provisional amounts as of December 31, 2017, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d). We recorded a provisional one-time non-cash charge of $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to remeasure the deferred tax assets for the new rate and for other legislative changes. We do not expect a U.S. federal current tax liability for the transition tax due to our high-tax foreign income, but we have recorded a provisional $31.1 million foreign tax credit offset with a full valuation allowance related to the transition tax. We did not record a current state tax liability related to the transition tax in accordance with the interpretation of existing state laws and the provisional estimates. The Company has not yet adopted an accounting policy related to the provision of deferred taxes related to GILTI. We did not change our assertion on the determination of which subsidiaries that we consider to be permanently invested and for which we do not expect to repatriate to the U.S. as a result of the Tax Reform Act. We will continue to collect and analyze data, including the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related taxes, interpret the Tax Reform Act and apply the additional guidance and legislative changes to be issued by the U.S. federal and state authorities and may be required to make adjustments to these provisional amounts. The accounting for the Tax Reform Act will be completed by the end of 2018 in accordance with SAB 118.\nSummary Rate Reconciliation - GAAP\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In percentages)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. federal tax rate\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increases (reductions) in taxes due to:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Venezuela devaluation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax on accelerated U.S. income(a)\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to valuation allowances\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign income taxes\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax reform\n</td> <td>47.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>French business tax\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes, net\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax rate on continuing operations\n</td> <td>86.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $23.5 million increase to current tax expense related to a transaction that accelerated U.S. taxable income.

Changes in judgment about the future realization of deferred tax assets can result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances. Based on our historical and future expected taxable earnings, we believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.\nContinuing Operations\n2017 Compared to U.S. Statutory Rate\nThe effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2017 was greater than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the one-time non-cash tax charge for the remeasurement of the deferred tax assets as a result of U.S. tax reform. The other items that cause the rate to be higher than the U.S. statutory rate include book losses for which no tax benefit can be recorded, nondeductible expenses in Mexico, taxes on cross border payments and the characterization of a French business tax as an income tax, partially offset by the geographical mix of earnings, significant tax benefits related to the distribution of share-based payments and a French income tax credit.\n2016 Compared to U.S. Statutory Rate\nThe effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2016 was greater than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the significant losses related to operations in the Republic of Ireland, for which no tax benefit can be recorded, a change in judgment resulting in a valuation allowance against certain U.S. tax attributes with a limited statutory carryforward period that are no longer more-likely-than-not to be realized, and the non-deductible expenses resulting from the currency devaluation in Venezuela. The other items that cause the rate to be higher than the U.S. statutory rate include book losses for which no tax benefit can be recorded, non-deductible expenses in Mexico, taxes on undistributed earnings and the characterization of a French business tax as an income tax, partially offset by the geographical mix of earnings and a French income tax credit.\n2015 Compared to U.S. Statutory Rate\nThe effective income tax rate on continuing operations in 2015 was higher than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a significant Venezuela currency remeasurement loss and impairment loss, which were largely non-deductible, and U.S. tax on accelerated taxable income. Excluding these items, the effective income tax rate was higher than the 35% U.S. statutory tax rate due to $3.7 million of tax expense due to the characterization of a French business tax as an income tax.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to $6.9 million in 2017 was primarily due to higher currency remeasurement charges from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency.\nThe change from a $16.3 million net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 to $10.3 million net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2016 was primarily due to improved results in our Venezuelan subsidiaries and lower currency remeasurement charges from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2015 was primarily due to a $35.3 million impairment charge related to Venezuelan property and equipment and $18.1 million in currency remeasurement charges from the devaluation of Venezuelan currency.\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the currency remeasurement charges of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and the Venezuela impairment charge that occurred in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP\nNon-GAAP results described in this filing are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with GAAP. The purpose of the Non-GAAP results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. The specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments, are described in detail on pages 28-30, and are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures below.\nThe full-year Non-GAAP tax rate in each year excludes certain pretax and income tax amounts. Amounts reported for prior periods have been updated in this report to present information consistently for all periods presented.\nThe Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. Additionally, non-GAAP results are utilized as performance measures in certain management incentive compensation plans.\nNon-GAAP results should not be considered as an alternative to revenue, income or earnings per share amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and should be read in conjunction with their GAAP counterparts.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

doing business in foreign countries, including labor and economic conditions, political instability, controls on repatriation of earnings and capital, nationalization, expropriation and other forms of restrictive action by local governments. Changes in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The future effects, if any, of these risks are unknown.\nOur international operations conduct a majority of their business in local currencies. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, they are affected by changes in the value of various local currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. Recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced our reported dollar revenues and operating profit, which may continue in 2018. Our operations in Venezuela are subject to local laws and regulatory interpretations that determine the exchange rate at which repatriating dividends may be converted. See Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Foreign Currency Translation on pages 56-57 for a description of our accounting methods and assumptions used to include our Venezuelan operations in our consolidated financial statements, and a description of the accounting for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies.\nChanges in exchange rates may also affect transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. From time to time, we use foreign currency forward and swap contracts to hedge transactional risks associated with foreign currencies, as discussed in", "summary": "The MD&A report by The Brink's Company discusses its financial condition and results of operations for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015. The company offers transportation and logistics management services for cash and valuables globally, with operations divided into North America, South America, and Rest of World segments. Revenues and operating profit are analyzed for each segment and on a consolidated level. It is highlighted that the company experienced significant organic growth in the South American region due to higher average selling prices and volume growth, as well as favorable currency impacts. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures are provided to reflect operating profit, income from continuing operations, and EPS without certain income and expense items. The report emphasizes cost savings and productivity improvements as key drivers of operating profit growth.", "item_7_tables": "Table 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE BRINK'S COMPANY\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016\nAND FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017\n\nOPERATIONS\nThe Brink's Company offers transportation and logistics management services for cash and valuables throughout the world. These services include:\n \u2022 Cash-in-Transit ( CIT\u201d) Services - armored vehicle transportation of valuables \n \u2022 ATM Services - replenishing and maintaining customers' automated teller machines; providing network infrastructure services \n \u2022 Global Services - secure international transportation of valuables \n \u2022 Cash Management Services \n \u25e6 Currency and coin counting and sorting; deposit preparation and reconciliations; other cash management services \n \u25e6 Safe and safe control device installation and servicing (including our patented CompuSafe\u00ae service) \n \u25e6 Vaulting services \n \u25e6 Check imaging services \n \u2022 Payment Services - bill payment and processing services on behalf of utility companies and other billers at any of our Brink's or Brink's - operated payment locations in Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Mexico and Brink's Money\u2122 general purpose reloadable prepaid cards and payroll cards in the U.S. \n \u2022 Commercial Security Systems Services - design and installation of security systems in designated markets in Europe \n \u2022 Guarding Services - protection of airports, offices, and certain other locations in Europe and Brazil with or without electronic surveillance, access control, fire prevention and highly trained patrolling personnel \nDuring the first quarter of 2017, we implemented changes to our organizational and management structure that resulted in changes to our operating segments for financial reporting purposes. Through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our business was reported in nine operating segments: U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Latin America, EMEA, Asia and Payment Services. Changes in our management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2017 required us to conduct an assessment in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, to determine our operating segments.\nAs a result of this assessment, we now have the following operating segments:\n \u2022 North America \n \u2022 South America \n \u2022 Rest of World. \nPrior period information has been revised to reflect our current segment structure.\nWe believe that Brink's has significant competitive advantages including:\n \u2022 track record of refining our business portfolio to deliver shareholder value \n \u2022 medium-term growth drivers from high-value services \n \u2022 global footprint in a world with increasing security needs \n \u2022 brand name recognition \n \u2022 reputation for a high level of service and security \n \u2022 risk management and logistics expertise \n \u2022 value-based solutions expertise \n \u2022 operational excellence \n \u2022 high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength \nWe focus our time and resources on service quality, protecting and strengthening our brand, and addressing our risks. Our marketing and sales efforts are enhanced by the Brink's\u201d brand, so we seek to protect and build its value. Because our services focus on handling, transporting, protecting and managing valuables, we strive to understand and manage risk.\nIn order to earn an adequate return on capital, we focus on the effective and efficient use of resources in addition to our pricing discipline. We attempt to maximize the amount of business that flows through our branches, vehicles and systems in order to obtain the lowest costs possible without compromising safety, security or service.\nOperating results may vary from period to period. Because revenues are generated from charges per service performed or based on the value of goods transported, they can be affected by both the level of economic activity and the volume of business for specific customers. We also periodically incur costs to change the scale of our operations when volumes increase or decrease. Incremental costs incurred usually relate to increasing or decreasing the number of employees and increasing or decreasing branches or administrative facilities. In addition, security costs can vary depending on performance, the cost of insurance coverage, and changes in crime rates (i.e., attacks and robberies).\nBrink's revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnalysis of Results: 2017 versus 2016\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide an analysis of our operations below on both a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP basis. The purpose of the non-GAAP information is to report our operating profit, income from continuing operations and earnings per share without certain income and expense items that do not reflect the regular earnings of our operations. The non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. The non-GAAP adjustments used to reconcile our GAAP results are described in detail on pages 28-30 and are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures on pages 35-37.\nDefinition of Organic Growth Organic growth represents the change in revenues or operating profit between the current and prior period excluding the effect of: acquisitions and dispositions and changes in currency exchange rates. See definitions on page 24.\n\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 35-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2017 versus 2016\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues increased $326.4 million as organic growth in Venezuela ($445.5 million), South America ($134.7 million), North America ($33.2 million), and Rest of World ($18.1 million), and the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($67.6 million) was partially offset by unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($372.7 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar ($400.8 million). Revenues increased 21% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Argentina (including the effects of inflation) and organic revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico driven by volume growth and price increases. See above for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues increased 9% to $2,608.2 million due the impact of acquisitions and inflation-based increases on labor and other operational costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Selling, general and administrative costs increased 10% to $468.2 million due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs driven by incentive-based compensation, partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $89.4 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic increases in Venezuela ($115.8 million), South America ($52.6 million) and North America ($31.3 million), and \n \u2022 the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($21.0 million), \n \u2022 lower organic impact of costs from reorganization and restructuring actions and acquisition and disposition activities ($18.8 million) included in \"Other items not allocated to segments\",  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($122.2 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, and \n \u2022 higher corporate expenses ($27.6 million on an organic basis) due to higher incentive-based compensation and security losses \nConsolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2017 decreased $19.3 million to $16.9 million primarily due to higher income tax expense ($79.2 million) driven by U.S. tax reform, higher interest expense ($11.8 million), and higher interest and other income (expense) ($21.1 million). These items were partially offset by the operating profit increase mentioned above. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.33, down from $0.72 in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2017 versus 2016\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues increased $284.5 million primarily due to organic growth in South America ($134.7 million), North America ($33.2 million), and Rest of World ($18.1 million), as well as the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($70.4 million) and currency exchange rates ($28.1 million). The favorable currency impact was driven by the Brazilian real and the euro, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the Argentine peso. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Argentina (including the effects of inflation) and organic revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico driven by volume growth and price increases. See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $65.6 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic increases in South America ($52.6 million) and North America ($31.3 million), and \n \u2022 the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($19.9 million),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 higher corporate expenses ($27.6 million on an organic basis) due to higher incentive-based compensation and security losses, and \n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($10.3 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2017 increased $41.6 million to $157.2 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($14.6 million) and higher interest expense ($10.7 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.03, up from $2.28 in 2016.\nRevenues and Operating Profit by Segment: 2017 versus 2016\n\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\n (a) Non-GAAP amounts include the impact of prior year comparable period results for acquired and disposed businesses. GAAP results also include the impact of acquisition-related intangible amortization, restructuring and other charges, and disposition related gains/losses. \n (b) The amounts in the Currency\u201d column consist of the effects of Venezuela devaluations and the sum of monthly currency changes. Monthly currency changes represent the accumulation throughout the year of the impact on current period results of changes in foreign currency rates from the prior year period. \n (c) Corporate expenses are not allocated to segment results. Corporate expenses include salaries and other costs to manage the global business and to perform activities required by public companies. \n (d) See pages 28-30 for more information. \nAnalysis of Segment Results: 2017 versus 2016\nNorth America\nRevenues increased 4% ($43.9 million) driven by organic growth of 3% ($33.2 million) and the favorable impact of acquisitions ($10.7 million). Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by price and volume growth in Mexico. Operating profit increased $33.9 million primarily due to organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico. Organic profit growth in the U.S. was driven by lower vehicle costs, labor and other productivity improvements, and lower security losses. Organic profit growth in Mexico was driven by productivity improvements.\nSouth America\nRevenues increased 29% ($205.9 million) primarily due to 19% organic growth ($134.7 million), the favorable impact of acquisitions ($63.7 million) and currency exchange rates ($7.5 million) mostly from the Brazilian real, partially offset by a decline in the Argentine peso. The organic growth was driven by inflation-based price increases in Argentina and increased volume growth and price increases in Brazil. Operating profit increased 49% ($60.2 million) driven by organic growth in Argentina and Brazil and the favorable impact of acquisitions ($16.0 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency ($8.4 million) driven by the Argentine peso.\nRest of World\nRevenues increased 4% ($34.7 million) due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates ($20.6 million), primarily from the euro, and 2% organic growth ($18.1 million). The organic revenue growth was driven by Greece and Asia, partially offset by a decrease in France due to pricing pressure. Operating profit increased 4% ($3.9 million) due to the favorable impact of currency ($2.2 million) and acquisitions and dispositions ($2.0 million). Organic growth was down slightly ($0.3 million) due to a decrease in France related to pricing pressure which was partially offset by growth in Asia.\nAnalysis of Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Results\n\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 35-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $40.8 million or 1% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($399.6 million), the impact of dispositions ($34.3 million), and an organic decrease in Rest of World ($3.4 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($226.4 million), South America ($124.7 million), and North America ($45.4 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar after February 2016. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the Mexican peso and most currencies in South America. Revenues increased 13% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and South America (including the effects of inflation). See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 2% to $2,391.7 million as changes in currency rates more than offset higher labor costs from inflation-based increases. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 6% to $424.3 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $88.1 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 a $35.3 million charge in 2015 related to impairment of fixed assets in Venezuela, which did not reoccur in 2016, \n \u2022 organic increases in Venezuela ($84.8 million), South America ($49.3 million), and Rest of World ($5.5 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($76.1 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, \n \u2022 higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016 ($15.0 million), \n \u2022 negative impact of exiting operations in Ireland ($10.0 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in North America ($1.1 million). \nConsolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $45.3 million from the prior year primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($26.6 million) and higher income tax expense ($12.0 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.72, up from negative $0.19 in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues decreased $68.5 million or 2% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($198.1 million), the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), and an organic decrease in Rest of World ($3.4 million), partially offset by organic growth in South America ($124.7 million), and North America ($45.4 million). The reduction in Non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, and most currencies in South America. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in South America (including the effects of inflation). See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $48.3 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic increases in South America ($49.3 million) and Rest of World ($5.5 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($23.0 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in North America ($1.1 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $28.5 million to $115.6 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($16.6 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.28, up from $1.75 in 2015.\nRevenues and Operating Profit by Segment: 2016 versus 2015\n\nAmounts may not add due to rounding.\nSee page 24 for footnotes.\nAnalysis of Segment Results: 2016 versus 2015\nNorth America\nRevenues decreased 1% ($13.7 million) due to the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates ($59.1 million) primarily from the Mexican peso, partially offset by organic growth of 4% ($45.4 million). Organic growth was driven by volume increases in the U.S. and price and volume increases in Mexico, with U.S. volume growth driven by the increased sales of cash recyclers to a large retailer. Operating profit decreased $5.5 million due to unfavorable currency ($4.4 million) primarily from the Mexican peso and organic decreases in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. organic decline was due to higher fleet and insurance costs and the Canada decline was due to inflationary cost increases and lower organic revenue growth. These declines were partially offset by organic growth in the U.S. Payments business driven by revenue growth and lower marketing expenditures related to increasing cardholders.\nSouth America\nRevenues decreased $0.6 million as the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates ($125.3 million) was mostly offset by 17% organic growth ($124.7 million) driven by inflation-based revenue increases in Argentina and price increases in Brazil. Operating profit increased 17% ($18.0 million) primarily due to organic growth in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, partially offset by unfavorable currency ($31.3 million). The organic growth in Brazil was driven by a favorable tax ruling and productivity improvements.\nRest of World\nRevenues decreased 5% ($54.2 million) due to the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), unfavorable currency ($13.7 million), and organic decreases ($3.4 million). Organic revenue decreases were driven by lower BGS volumes, and lower revenue in France due to volume and pricing pressure and the loss of an airport guarding contract, partially offset by organic growth in Asia driven by Hong Kong and", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Through the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, our business was reported in nine operating segments: U.S., France, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Latin America, EMEA, Asia and Payment Services. Changes in our management reporting structure during the first quarter of 2017 required us to conduct an assessment in accordance with ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, to determine our operating segments.\nAs a result of this assessment, we now have the following operating segments:\n \u2022 North America \n \u2022 South America \n \u2022 Rest of World. \nPrior period information has been revised to reflect our current segment structure.\nWe believe that Brink's has significant competitive advantages including:\n \u2022 track record of refining our business portfolio to deliver shareholder value \n \u2022 medium-term growth drivers from high-value services \n \u2022 global footprint in a world with increasing security needs \n \u2022 brand name recognition \n \u2022 reputation for a high level of service and security \n \u2022 risk management and logistics expertise \n \u2022 value-based solutions expertise \n \u2022 operational excellence \n \u2022 high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength \nWe focus our time and resources on service quality, protecting and strengthening our brand, and addressing our risks.

We also periodically incur costs to change the scale of our operations when volumes increase or decrease. Incremental costs incurred usually relate to increasing or decreasing the number of employees and increasing or decreasing branches or administrative facilities. In addition, security costs can vary depending on performance, the cost of insurance coverage, and changes in crime rates (i.e., attacks and robberies).\nBrink's revenues and related operating profit are generally higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, due to generally increased economic activity associated with the holiday season.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAnalysis of Results: 2017 versus 2016\nConsolidated Results\nGAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide an analysis of our operations below on both a generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP basis.

A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar ($400.8 million). Revenues increased 21% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and Argentina (including the effects of inflation) and organic revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico driven by volume growth and price increases. See above for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues increased 9% to $2,608.2 million due the impact of acquisitions and inflation-based increases on labor and other operational costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Selling, general and administrative costs increased 10% to $468.2 million due primarily to the impact of acquisitions and higher compensation costs driven by incentive-based compensation, partially offset by changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $89.4 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic increases in Venezuela ($115.8 million), South America ($52.6 million) and North America ($31.3 million), and \n \u2022 the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($21.0 million), \n \u2022 lower organic impact of costs from reorganization and restructuring actions and acquisition and disposition activities ($18.8 million) included in \"Other items not allocated to segments\",  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($122.2 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, and \n \u2022 higher corporate expenses ($27.6 million on an organic basis) due to higher incentive-based compensation and security losses \nConsolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2017 decreased $19.3 million to $16.9 million primarily due to higher income tax expense ($79.2 million) driven by U.S. tax reform, higher interest expense ($11.8 million), and higher interest and other income (expense) ($21.1 million). These items were partially offset by the operating profit increase mentioned above. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.33, down from $0.72 in 2016.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2017 versus 2016\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues increased $284.5 million primarily due to organic growth in South America ($134.7 million), North America ($33.2 million), and Rest of World ($18.1 million), as well as the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($70.4 million) and currency exchange rates ($28.1 million). The favorable currency impact was driven by the Brazilian real and the euro, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the Argentine peso. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Argentina (including the effects of inflation) and organic revenue growth in Brazil and Mexico driven by volume growth and price increases. See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $65.6 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic increases in South America ($52.6 million) and North America ($31.3 million), and \n \u2022 the favorable impact of acquisitions and dispositions ($19.9 million),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 higher corporate expenses ($27.6 million on an organic basis) due to higher incentive-based compensation and security losses, and \n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($10.3 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2017 increased $41.6 million to $157.2 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by the corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($14.6 million) and higher interest expense ($10.7 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $3.03, up from $2.28 in 2016.\nRevenues and Operating Profit by Segment: 2017 versus 2016\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisitions /\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dispositions(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Currency(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Organic\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,210.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,254.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South America\n</td> <td>718.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>924.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rest of World\n</td> <td>979.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,014.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues -

Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by price and volume growth in Mexico. Operating profit increased $33.9 million primarily due to organic growth in the U.S. and Mexico. Organic profit growth in the U.S. was driven by lower vehicle costs, labor and other productivity improvements, and lower security losses. Organic profit growth in Mexico was driven by productivity improvements.\nSouth America\nRevenues increased 29% ($205.9 million) primarily due to 19% organic growth ($134.7 million), the favorable impact of acquisitions ($63.7 million) and currency exchange rates ($7.5 million) mostly from the Brazilian real, partially offset by a decline in the Argentine peso. The organic growth was driven by inflation-based price increases in Argentina and increased volume growth and price increases in Brazil. Operating profit increased 49% ($60.2 million) driven by organic growth in Argentina and Brazil and the favorable impact of acquisitions ($16.0 million), partially offset by unfavorable currency ($8.4 million) driven by the Argentine peso.\nRest of World\nRevenues increased 4% ($34.7 million) due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates ($20.6 million), primarily from the euro, and 2% organic growth ($18.1 million). The organic revenue growth was driven by Greece and Asia, partially offset by a decrease in France due to pricing pressure. Operating profit increased 4% ($3.9 million) due to the favorable impact of currency ($2.2 million) and acquisitions and dispositions ($2.0 million). Organic growth was down slightly ($0.3 million) due to a decrease in France related to pricing pressure which was partially offset by growth in Asia.\nAnalysis of Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Results\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except for per share amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,020.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,061.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>2,391.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,443.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>424.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>184.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>36.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>fav\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,908.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,976.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating profit\n</td> <td>215.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>167.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP income from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>115.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Amounts reported in this table are attributable to the shareholders of Brink's and exclude earnings related to noncontrolling interests. \n (b) Non-GAAP results are reconciled to the applicable GAAP results on pages 35-37. \nGAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nConsolidated Revenues Revenues decreased $40.8 million or 1% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($399.6 million), the impact of dispositions ($34.3 million), and an organic decrease in Rest of World ($3.4 million), partially offset by organic growth in Venezuela ($226.4 million), South America ($124.7 million), and North America ($45.4 million). A significant portion of the reduction in revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar after February 2016. The U.S. dollar also strengthened against the Mexican peso and most currencies in South America. Revenues increased 13% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in Venezuela and South America (including the effects of inflation). See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses Cost of revenues decreased 2% to $2,391.7 million as changes in currency rates more than offset higher labor costs from inflation-based increases. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased 6% to $424.3 million due primarily to changes in currency exchange rates.\nConsolidated Operating Profit Operating profit increased $88.1 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 a $35.3 million charge in 2015 related to impairment of fixed assets in Venezuela, which did not reoccur in 2016, \n \u2022 organic increases in Venezuela ($84.8 million), South America ($49.3 million), and Rest of World ($5.5 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($76.1 million), including the effects of Venezuela devaluations, \n \u2022 higher reorganization and restructuring costs in 2016 ($15.0 million), \n \u2022 negative impact of exiting operations in Ireland ($10.0 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in North America ($1.1 million). \nConsolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $45.3 million from the prior year primarily due to the operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by higher income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($26.6 million) and higher income tax expense ($12.0 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.72, up from negative $0.19 in 2015.\nNon-GAAP Basis\nAnalysis of Consolidated Results: 2016 versus 2015\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Revenues Non-GAAP revenues decreased $68.5 million or 2% due to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($198.1 million), the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), and an organic decrease in Rest of World ($3.4 million), partially offset by organic growth in South America ($124.7 million), and North America ($45.4 million). The reduction in Non-GAAP revenues from currency exchange rates relates to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, and most currencies in South America. Non-GAAP revenues increased 6% on an organic basis due mainly to higher average selling prices in South America (including the effects of inflation). See page 22 for our definition of organic.\u201d\nNon-GAAP Consolidated Operating Profit Non-GAAP operating profit increased $48.3 million due mainly to:\n \u2022 organic increases in South America ($49.3 million) and Rest of World ($5.5 million), and \n \u2022 lower corporate expenses ($13.4 million on an organic basis),  partially offset by:\n \u2022 unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates ($23.0 million), and \n \u2022 organic decreases in North America ($1.1 million). \nNon-GAAP Consolidated Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Brink's and Related Per Share Amounts Non-GAAP income from continuing operations attributable to Brink's shareholders in 2016 increased $28.5 million to $115.6 million primarily due to the non-GAAP operating profit increase mentioned above, partially offset by corresponding higher non-GAAP income tax expense ($16.6 million).

Organic growth was driven by volume increases in the U.S. and price and volume increases in Mexico, with U.S. volume growth driven by the increased sales of cash recyclers to a large retailer. Operating profit decreased $5.5 million due to unfavorable currency ($4.4 million) primarily from the Mexican peso and organic decreases in the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. organic decline was due to higher fleet and insurance costs and the Canada decline was due to inflationary cost increases and lower organic revenue growth. These declines were partially offset by organic growth in the U.S. Payments business driven by revenue growth and lower marketing expenditures related to increasing cardholders.\nSouth America\nRevenues decreased $0.6 million as the unfavorable impact of currency exchange rates ($125.3 million) was mostly offset by 17% organic growth ($124.7 million) driven by inflation-based revenue increases in Argentina and price increases in Brazil. Operating profit increased 17% ($18.0 million) primarily due to organic growth in Argentina, Chile, and Brazil, partially offset by unfavorable currency ($31.3 million). The organic growth in Brazil was driven by a favorable tax ruling and productivity improvements.\nRest of World\nRevenues decreased 5% ($54.2 million) due to the impact of dispositions ($37.1 million), unfavorable currency ($13.7 million), and organic decreases ($3.4 million). Organic revenue decreases were driven by lower BGS volumes, and lower revenue in France due to volume and pricing pressure and the loss of an airport guarding contract, partially offset by organic growth in Asia driven by Hong Kong and"}
