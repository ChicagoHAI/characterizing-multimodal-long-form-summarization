MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nGeneral\nChina XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 633 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2019. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang province. Our Research and Development (the \"R&D\") team consists of 131 professionals and 6 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have a portfolio of 509 patents, 32 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 477 of which we have applications pending in China as of December 31, 2019.\nOur products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE).\nThe Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 31 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines. In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory ( Qinling Road Project\u201d) and Jiangnan Road Factory ( Jiangnan Road Project\u201d) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of second quarter of 2020, Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.\nTable 191: <table><tr><td>68 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2019, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (\"JAFZA\") in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nWhen reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 193: <table><tr><td>69 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights.\nWe depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values, and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period. The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nNo impairment on our long-lived assets was recognized in 2019 and 2018.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nWe extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end.\nValuation of Inventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value below cost. Expected demand and anticipated sales price are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes of our inventory valuation analysis, we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders as well as industry trends and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before the issuance of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and sales price have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales price used for purposes of our inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Our products have a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. We have not experienced any material inventory write-downs before.\nTable 195: <table><tr><td>70 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Uncertainties and Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\nOur income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized and measured primarily based on actual and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total gross deferred income tax assets of US$14,313,575 and US$10,559,911, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was US$14,313,575 and US$10,559,911, respectively.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent (50%) likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly re-evaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the applicable tax authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. However, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date.\nWe estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The model incorporates subjective assumptions. The expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. There is no expected dividend yield, as the Company has not paid dividend and does not anticipate paying dividend over the term of the grants.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td>71 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASC 842\"). The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The Company has adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. This adoption approach resulted in a balance sheet presentation that was not be comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. Additionally, the Company used the package of practical expedients that allowed the Company to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. The Company also elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. The following table summarizes the effect on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of adopting ASC842.\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Effect of </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Adoption </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>US$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>US$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>US$ </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Land use rights, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,796,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,796,795 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease right-of-use assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,872,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,872,008 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued expenses and other liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126,926,898 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>752,795 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(126,174,103 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease liabilities, current </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,086,529 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,086,529 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating lease liabilities, non-current </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,741,479 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,741,479 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2018-02\u201d). The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users. ASU 2018-02 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d). The new guidance largely aligns the accounting for share-based awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Existing guidance for employee awards will apply to non-employee share-based transactions with limited exceptions. The new guidance also clarifies that any share-based payment awards issued to customers should be evaluated under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2018-07 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses for financial assets. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective dates that were originally required by ASU 2016-13 for certain entities. The Company determined it was eligible as a smaller reporting company (SRC) under the SEC's definition based on an its most recent SRC determination as of November 15, 2019 in accordance with SEC regulations and will adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 200: <table><tr><td>72 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company will adopt the standard on January 1, 2020, and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ( ASU 2019-12). The new guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period. It also simplifies other aspects of accounting for income taxes. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table sets forth statements of comprehensive income (loss) data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in millions of US$:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(US$ in millions, except the percentage) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,228.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,055.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues increased by 13.6%, or US$173.4 million, in 2019 as compared to 2018. This was due to the combined result of: (i) an increase of 45.9% in the average RMB selling price of our products, partially offset by (ii) the decrease of 18.8% in the sales volume; and (iii) a depreciation of RMB against US dollars by 6.0%, as compared with those of last year.\nTable 203: <table><tr><td>73 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Domestic market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from domestic market increased by 10.1% or US$127.2 million, as a result of (i) an increase of 43.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products; and partially offset by (ii) a decrease of 20.0% in sales volume; and (iii) a depreciation of RMB against US dollars by 6.0% as compared with those of last year.\nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 7.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for twelve months of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since summer of 2018 continued to exacerbate automobile business environment, but thanks to our positive efforts to expand our marketing areas and customer bases and to meet their new requirements, the Company has achieved sales growth of 30.2% in Northeast China, 22.0% in South China, 18.0% in Central China, and 9.0% in North China, partially offset by the sales decrease of 6.4% in East China and 2.4% in Southwest China.\nAs for the RMB selling price, the increase of 43.6% was mainly due to: (i) increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic market; and (ii) sales of high-priced semi-finished goods in domestic market during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(2) Overseas market\nOverseas sales were US$61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to US$15.0 million in prior year.\nAfter a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, the Company has established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia.\nWe have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2019, we provided an allowance of US$62.8 million for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td>74 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 37.8% or US$138.6 million due to the operating cash outflows. Inventories increased by 3.6% as a result of more purchases of the raw materials for the upcoming orders. Accounts receivable decreased by 24.6% mainly due to the provision of doubtful accounts of US$62.8 million for a UAE customer as a result of estimated probable collection issue. Prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by 30.0% or US$39.6 million primarily because (i) advances to suppliers for purchasing raw materials increased by US$61.9 million; (ii) value added taxes receivables increased by US$1.5 million, partially offset by (iii) other prepaid expenses decreased by US$10.8 million, which mainly included prepaid miscellaneous service fee, staff advance and interest receivable, and (iv) consideration for sales of Shanghai Sales decreased by US$7.3 million. Property, plant and equipment increased by 7.0% as the equipment for upgrading existing 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics facilities was partially delivered in 2019. The aggregate short-term and long-term bank loans increased by 19.2% due to using the line of credits to support operating and investing activities in HLJ Xinda Group and Sichuan Xinda.

We have financed these requirements primarily from cash generated from operations, bank borrowings and the issuance of our convertible preferred stocks and debt financings. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had US$228.4 million and US$367.0 million, respectively, in the total amount of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, which were primarily deposited with banks in China (including Hong Kong and Macau SAR), UAE and U.S. As of December 31, 2019, we had US$680.2 million outstanding short-term bank loans (including the current portion of long-term bank loans), including US$407.8 million unsecured loan and US$64.5 million loans secured by accounts receivable, US$14.3 million loans secured by restricted cash, US$5.7 million loans secured by inventories, US$128.0 syndicated loans, and US$59.9 million long-term bank loans that due in one year. We also had US$322.5 million long-term loans (excluding the current portion), including US$1.3 million loans secured by an undated security cheque, and US$321.2 million unsecured loans. Short-term and long-term bank loans in total bear a weighted average interest rate of 5.1% per annum and do not contain any renewal terms.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nGeneral\nChina XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 633 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2019. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang province. Our Research and Development (the \"R&D\") team consists of 131 professionals and 6 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have a portfolio of 509 patents, 32 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 477 of which we have applications pending in China as of December 31, 2019.\nOur products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE).\nThe Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 31 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines. In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory ( Qinling Road Project\u201d) and Jiangnan Road Factory ( Jiangnan Road Project\u201d) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of second quarter of 2020, Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.\n 68 \n \nIn December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2019, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (\"JAFZA\") in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nWhen reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n 69 \n \nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights.\nWe depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values, and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period. The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nNo impairment on our long-lived assets was recognized in 2019 and 2018.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nWe extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end.\nValuation of Inventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value below cost. Expected demand and anticipated sales price are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes of our inventory valuation analysis, we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders as well as industry trends and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before the issuance of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and sales price have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales price used for purposes of our inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Our products have a long life cycle and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. We have not experienced any material inventory write-downs before.\n 70 \n \nIncome Tax Uncertainties and Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets\nOur income tax provision, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized and measured primarily based on actual and expected future income, PRC statutory income tax rates, PRC tax regulations and tax planning strategies.\nSignificant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the PRC, evaluating uncertain tax positions, and assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets. Actual results could differ materially from those judgments, and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had total gross deferred income tax assets of US$14,313,575 and US$10,559,911, respectively. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, we believe expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction. We evaluate the level of our valuation allowances quarterly, and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was US$14,313,575 and US$10,559,911, respectively.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position if we determine the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based solely on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. In addition, a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent (50%) likely of being realized upon settlement. The tax positions are regularly re-evaluated based on the results of the examination of income tax filings, statute of limitations expirations and changes in tax law that would either increase or decrease the technical merits of a position relative to the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. In the normal course of business, we are regularly audited by the PRC tax authorities. The settlement of any particular issue with the applicable tax authority could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and recognize the cost over the period the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, which generally is the vesting period. We have elected to recognize the compensation cost for an award with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. However, the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date.\nWe estimated the fair value of our share options using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The model incorporates subjective assumptions. The expected volatility was based on implied volatilities from traded options and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined using the Federal Reserve nominal rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. There is no expected dividend yield, as the Company has not paid dividend and does not anticipate paying dividend over the term of the grants.\n 71 \n \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\"ASC 842\"). The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The Company has adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. This adoption approach resulted in a balance sheet presentation that was not be comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. Additionally, the Company used the package of practical expedients that allowed the Company to not reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. The Company also elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing leases. The following table summarizes the effect on the consolidated balance sheets as a result of adopting ASC842.\n\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( ASU 2018-02\u201d). The new guidance allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will improve the usefulness of information reported to financial statement users. ASU 2018-02 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d). The new guidance largely aligns the accounting for share-based awards issued to employees and nonemployees. Existing guidance for employee awards will apply to non-employee share-based transactions with limited exceptions. The new guidance also clarifies that any share-based payment awards issued to customers should be evaluated under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2018-07 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, and there was no material impact on its consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses for financial assets. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective dates that were originally required by ASU 2016-13 for certain entities. The Company determined it was eligible as a smaller reporting company (SRC) under the SEC's definition based on an its most recent SRC determination as of November 15, 2019 in accordance with SEC regulations and will adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n 72 \n \nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company will adopt the standard on January 1, 2020, and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ( ASU 2019-12). The new guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period. It also simplifies other aspects of accounting for income taxes. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table sets forth statements of comprehensive income (loss) data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in millions of US$:\n\nRevenues\nRevenues increased by 13.6%, or US$173.4 million, in 2019 as compared to 2018. This was due to the combined result of: (i) an increase of 45.9% in the average RMB selling price of our products, partially offset by (ii) the decrease of 18.8% in the sales volume; and (iii) a depreciation of RMB against US dollars by 6.0%, as compared with those of last year.\n 73 \n \n(1) Domestic market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from domestic market increased by 10.1% or US$127.2 million, as a result of (i) an increase of 43.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products; and partially offset by (ii) a decrease of 20.0% in sales volume; and (iii) a depreciation of RMB against US dollars by 6.0% as compared with those of last year.\nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 7.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for twelve months of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since summer of 2018 continued to exacerbate automobile business environment, but thanks to our positive efforts to expand our marketing areas and customer bases and to meet their new requirements, the Company has achieved sales growth of 30.2% in Northeast China, 22.0% in South China, 18.0% in Central China, and 9.0% in North China, partially offset by the sales decrease of 6.4% in East China and 2.4% in Southwest China.\nAs for the RMB selling price, the increase of 43.6% was mainly due to: (i) increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic market; and (ii) sales of high-priced semi-finished goods in domestic market during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(2) Overseas market\nOverseas sales were US$61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to US$15.0 million in prior year.\nAfter a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, the Company has established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia.\nWe have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2019, we provided an allowance of US$62.8 million for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\n 74 \n \nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories for the periods indicated.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nGeneral\nChina XD is one of the leading specialty chemical companies engaged in the research, development, manufacture and sale of modified plastics primarily for automotive applications in China, and to a lesser extent, in Dubai, UAE. Through our wholly-owned operating subsidiaries in China and UAE, we develop modified plastics using our proprietary technology, manufacture and sell our products primarily for use in the fabrication of automobile parts and components. We have 633 certifications from manufacturers in the automobile industry as of December 31, 2019. We are the only company certified as a National Enterprise Technology Center in modified plastics industry in Heilongjiang province. Our Research and Development (the \"R&D\") team consists of 131 professionals and 6 consultants. As a result of the integration of our academic and technological expertise, we have a portfolio of 509 patents, 32 of which we have obtained the patent rights and the remaining 477 of which we have applications pending in China as of December 31, 2019.\nOur products include twelve categories: Modified Polypropylene (PP), Modified Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66), Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6), Modified Polyoxymethylenes (POM), Modified Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO), Plastic Alloy, Modified Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Modified Polyimide (PI), Modified Polylactic acid (PLA), Poly Ether Ether Ketone (PEEK), and Polyethylene (PE).\nThe Company's products are primarily used in the production of exterior and interior trim and functional components of 31 automobile brands and 111 automobile models manufactured in China, including Audi, Mercedes Benz, BMW, Toyota, Buick, Chevrolet, Mazda, Volvo, Ford, Citroen, Jinbei, VW Passat, Golf, Jetta, etc. Our research center is dedicated to the research and development of modified plastics, and benefits from its cooperation with well-known scientists from prestigious universities in China. We operate three manufacturing plants in Harbin, Heilongjiang in the PRC. Prior to December 2012, we had approximately 255,000 metric tons of annual production capacity across 58 automatic production lines utilizing German twin-screw extruding systems, automatic weighing systems and Taiwan conveyer systems. In December 2012, we further expanded our third production base in Harbin with additional 135,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, bringing total installed production capacity in our three production bases to 390,000 metric tons with additional 30 new production lines. In July 2017, our Harbin campus launched a new industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics. As a result, our production capacity in Harbin, Heilongjiang was downgraded to 290,000 MT. In 2019, our Harbin campus started two equipment projects in Qinling Road Factory ( Qinling Road Project\u201d) and Jiangnan Road Factory ( Jiangnan Road Project\u201d) for equipment upgrade and overhaul progress, which further downgraded our production capacity to 135,000 MT. The industrial project for upgrading existing equipment for 100,000 metric tons of engineering plastics was expected to be completed by the end of second quarter of 2020, Qinling Road Project and Jiangnan Road Project was expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2020, thus bringing the production capacity in Harbin Campus back to 390,000 MT. Also, in July 2017, HLJ Xinda Group started an industrial project for 300,000 metric tons of biological composite materials, an industrial project for a 3D printing intelligent manufacture demonstration factory and a 3D printing display and experience cloud factory. This project with four workshops was formally broken ground in December 2019. The Company expects the gradual trial out by the end of 2022 and put into production by the end of 2023.\n 68 \n \nIn December 2013, we broke ground on the construction of our fourth production plant in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, with additional 300,000 metric tons of annual production capacity, which we expect will bring total domestic installed production capacity to 590,000 metric tons with the addition of 70 new production lines upon the completion of the construction of our fourth production plant. Sichuan Xinda has been supplying to its customers since 2013. We installed 50 production lines in the second half of 2016 in our Sichuan plant with production capacity of 216,000 metric tons during the year of 2017 and an additional 10 production lines in July 2018, bringing the total capacity to 259,200 metric tons. As of December 31, 2019, there is still construction ongoing on the site of our Sichuan plant which is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn order to develop potential overseas markets, Dubai Xinda obtained one leased property and two purchased properties, approximately 52,530 square meters in total, including one leased 10,000 square meters, and two purchased 20,206 and 22,324 square meters on January 25, 2015, June 28, 2016 and September 21, 2016, respectively, from Jebel Ali Free Zone Authority (\"JAFZA\") in Dubai, UAE, with constructed building comprising warehouses, offices and service blocks. In addition to the earlier 10 trial production lines in Dubai Xinda, the Company completed installing 45 production lines with 11,250 metric tons of annual production capacity by the end of November 2018, and an additional 30 production lines with 7,500 metric tons of annual production capacity. The Company estimates 22 production lines will be put into production in the fourth quarter of 2021, 8 production lines will be put into production in the second quarter of 2022, bringing total installed production capacity in Dubai Xinda to 21,250 metric tons, targeting high-end products for the overseas market.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect (1) the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities; (2) the disclosure of our contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period; and (3) the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We continually evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions based on our own historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and our expectations regarding the future based on available information which together form our basis for making judgments about matters that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, our actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our accounting policies require a higher degree of judgment than others in their application.\nWhen reading our consolidated financial statements, you should consider our selection of critical accounting policies, the judgment and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\n 69 \n \nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and land use rights.\nWe depreciate and amortize our property, plant and equipment and land use rights, using the straight-line method of accounting over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We make estimates of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, including the salvage values, and land use rights in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during each reporting period. The estimated useful life is the period over which the long-lived assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the Company.\nWe evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and land use rights for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. We estimate the fair value of the asset or asset group through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary. Assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nNo impairment on our long-lived assets was recognized in 2019 and 2018.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In establishing the required allowance, we consider historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions, the amount of receivables in dispute, and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. We do not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to our customers.\nWe extend unsecured credit to customers with good credit history. We review our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine if the bad debt allowance is adequate at each year-end.\nValuation of Inventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for net realizable value below cost.

In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which amended the effective dates that were originally required by ASU 2016-13 for certain entities. The Company determined it was eligible as a smaller reporting company (SRC) under the SEC's definition based on an its most recent SRC determination as of November 15, 2019 in accordance with SEC regulations and will adopt ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the standard on its consolidated financial statements.\n 72 \n \nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ( ASU 2018-13\u201d), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements. The Company will adopt the standard on January 1, 2020, and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ( ASU 2019-12). The new guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences and the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period. It also simplifies other aspects of accounting for income taxes. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table sets forth statements of comprehensive income (loss) data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 in millions of US$:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(US$ in millions, except the percentage) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,274.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,228.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84.9 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,055.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(82.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(150.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.4 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(107.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.0 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(95.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues increased by 13.6%, or US$173.4 million, in 2019 as compared to 2018. This was due to the combined result of: (i) an increase of 45.9% in the average RMB selling price of our products, partially offset by (ii) the decrease of 18.8% in the sales volume; and (iii) a depreciation of RMB against US dollars by 6.0%, as compared with those of last year.\n 73 \n \n(1) Domestic market\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue from domestic market increased by 10.1% or US$127.2 million, as a result of (i) an increase of 43.6% in the average RMB selling price of our products; and partially offset by (ii) a decrease of 20.0% in sales volume; and (iii) a depreciation of RMB against US dollars by 6.0% as compared with those of last year.\nAccording to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, automobile production and sales in China decreased by 7.5% and 8.2%, respectively, for twelve months of 2019 as compared to the same period of 2018. The weakening in macroeconomic conditions since summer of 2018 continued to exacerbate automobile business environment, but thanks to our positive efforts to expand our marketing areas and customer bases and to meet their new requirements, the Company has achieved sales growth of 30.2% in Northeast China, 22.0% in South China, 18.0% in Central China, and 9.0% in North China, partially offset by the sales decrease of 6.4% in East China and 2.4% in Southwest China.\nAs for the RMB selling price, the increase of 43.6% was mainly due to: (i) increased sales of new categories of higher-end products of PA66 and PA6 produced with high-priced raw materials with higher selling price in domestic market; and (ii) sales of high-priced semi-finished goods in domestic market during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n(2) Overseas market\nOverseas sales were US$61.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to US$15.0 million in prior year.\nAfter a successful trial production at our production base in Dubai in November 2018, the Company has established business relationships with new customers in UAE and India, and shipped products to the end users in Europe and Southeast Asia.\nWe have experienced a delay in cash collection from a major customer in UAE. As of December 31, 2019, we provided an allowance of US$62.8 million for the overdue accounts receivable from the major customer in UAE, as the customer failed to make payments under the agreed extended repayment plan.\n 74 \n \nThe following table summarizes the breakdown of revenues by categories for the periods indicated.\nTable 207: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenues\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(US$ in millions, except the percentage) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Modified Polyamide 66 (PA66) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>427.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Modified Polyamide 6 (PA6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>338.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Plastic Alloy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>245.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Modified Polypropylene (PP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>126.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Modified Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Polyoxymethylenes (POM) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Polyphenylene Oxide (PPO) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Modified Polylactic acid (PLA) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Polyethylene (PE) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Semi-finished goods </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Raw Materials </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.5 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,448.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td>"}
