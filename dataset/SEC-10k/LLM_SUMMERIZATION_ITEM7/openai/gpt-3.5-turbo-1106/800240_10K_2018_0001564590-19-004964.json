Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide information to assist readers in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We recommend reading this MD&A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nWe are a leading provider of business services and supplies, products and technology solutions through our fully integrated business-to-business ( B2B\u201d) distribution platform of 1,361 retail stores, online presence, and dedicated sales professionals and technicians to retail consumers and small, medium and enterprise businesses. Through our banner brands Office Depot\u00ae, OfficeMax\u00ae, CompuCom\u00ae and Grand&Toy\u00ae, we offer our customers the tools and resources they need to focus on their passion of starting, growing and running their business.\nAt December 29, 2018, our operations are organized into three reportable segments (or Divisions\u201d): Business Solutions Division, Retail Division and CompuCom Division.\nThe Business Solutions Division or BSD provides customers with office supply products and services in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada through dedicated sales forces, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our Internet websites.\nThe Retail Division includes our chain of retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where we sell office supplies, technology products and solutions, business machines and related supplies, print, cleaning, breakroom supplies and facilities products, and furniture. In addition, our Retail Division offers a range of business-related services targeted to small businesses, technology support services as well as printing, copying, mailing and shipping services.\nThe CompuCom Division was formed during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. ( CompuCom\u201d). The CompuCom Division provides information technology ( IT\u201d) outsourcing services and products to enterprise organizations in the United States and Canada, and offers a broad range of solutions including end user computing support, managed IT services, data center monitoring and management, service desk, network infrastructure, IT workforce solutions, mobile device management and cloud services.\nAcquisitions\nOver the last two years, we have been undergoing a strategic transformation to pivot Office Depot into an integrated B2B distribution platform, with the objective of expanding our product offerings to include value-added services for our customers and capture greater market share.\nAs part of this transformation, we acquired CompuCom in 2017 and an enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider in 2018. The latter gives us access to a platform for selling or providing Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) related hardware and projects to the education market. IoT refers to the connection of intelligent systems and devices to allow them to automatically share information so that systems and devices work intelligently together to develop and enhance solutions and reduce human intervention.\nTo strengthen our core operations, over the last two years we have also expanded the reach of our distribution network by identifying and acquiring profitable regional office supply distribution businesses serving small and mid-market customers in geographic areas that were previously underserved by our network. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, for an effective and accretive means to expand our distribution reach, target new business customers and grow our offerings beyond traditional office supplies.\nThe aggregate total purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, for the seven acquisitions completed in 2018 was approximately $114 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. The aggregate purchase price was primarily funded with cash on hand, with the remainder consisting of contingent consideration estimated to be $28 million, the majority of which will be paid in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe operating results of these companies are combined with our operating results subsequent to their purchase dates. The operating results of the office supply distribution businesses we acquired are included in the Business Solutions Division segment, whereas the operating results of CompuCom and the enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider are included in the CompuCom Division. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable of Content\nDisposition of the International Division - Discontinued Operations\nIn September 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell substantially all of our international operations, formerly reported as the International Division through four disposal groups (Europe, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand ( Oceania\u201d) and mainland China).\nOn December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Europe (the European Business\u201d) to The AURELIUS Group (the Purchaser\u201d) and recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $108 million in 2016. We recorded approximately $8 million of additional costs associated with the sale during 2017. We retained the assets and obligations of a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom.\nWe completed the sale of our business in South Korea on April 26, 2017, and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $12 million. Additionally, we completed the sale of our business in mainland China on July 28, 2017, and recognized a cumulative loss of $9 million associated with the sale, of which $10 million was recognized in the first half of 2017 and was partially offset by a $1 million gain recognized at the time of sale. We retained the sourcing and trading operations of the former International Division, which are presented as Other in Note 5. Segment Information\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe completed the sale of our businesses in Australia on February 5, 2018, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $1 million. Additionally, we completed the sale of our business in New Zealand on May 4, 2018, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $3 million. With the sale of this last disposal group, the sale of the International Operations is complete, and there are no further discontinued operations at December 29, 2018.\nRefer to Note 18. Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOverview of 2018 Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations and Liquidity\nThe following summarizes the more significant factors impacting our operating results from continuing operations for the 52-week period ended December 29, 2018 (also referred to as 2018\u201d) and the 52-week period ended December 30, 2017 (also referred to as 2017\u201d) as well as our liquidity in 2018 and 2017.\nOur consolidated sales were 8% higher in 2018 compared to 2017 mostly as a result of including our CompuCom Division's sales for the full year in 2018. Our Business Solutions Division also contributed higher sales of $174 million, which represented an improvement from the prior year of 3% primarily from acquisitions. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower sales in our Retail Division, which decreased 6% year-over-year from lower comparable store sales and store closures.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Solutions Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in comparable store sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CompuCom Division **\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> **\n</td> <td> We formed the CompuCom Division as a result of our acquisition of CompuCom on November 8, 2017.

Higher service revenues were driven primarily by the acquisition of CompuCom. Service revenues in 2018 were also impacted by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which negatively affected the comparability of service revenues by $57 million year-over-year. Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Excluding our CompuCom Division and the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard, service revenues grew 13% as a result of our strategic efforts to expand the array of enterprise and consumer service offerings. The primary drivers of our year-over-year growth in service revenues, excluding the CompuCom acquisition, include higher demand for our managed print and fulfillment services, and the expansion of our service and product subscriptions, with more than one million new subscriptions in 2018 generating over $100 million in sales. On a consolidated basis, services represent approximately 15% and 9% of our total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Significant Factors Impacting Total Company Results and Liquidity\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total gross profit increased by $90 million or 4% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from lower sales in our retail stores.

In addition, we completed several acquisitions and dispositions, some of which resulted in the recognition of a gain or loss for tax purposes that differed from the amount recognized for GAAP purposes. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 51%, primarily impacted by the reduction in the statutory effective Federal rate from 35% to 21% which caused a non-cash charge of $68 million, partially offset by the reversal of $42 million of our U.S. federal and state valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was more likely than not that a benefit from the related deferred tax assets would be realizable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.18 in 2018 compared to $0.27 in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.01 in 2018 compared to $0.06 in 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Including diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations, net diluted earnings per share was $0.19 in 2018 compared to $0.34 in 2017.

As disclosed in Note 18 Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, between the third quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2018, we sold substantially all of our international operations. As a result, over the last two years the Business Solutions Division's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has been primarily limited to our Canadian operations, and the fluctuation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar has had an immaterial impact to the changes in sales for the Division for all periods herein presented.\nProduct sales from our Business Solutions Division increased 3% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to acquisitions, higher online sales and growth in adjacency categories, such as cleaning/breakroom supplies and furniture, partially offset by lower sales of other product categories including paper, toner and ink. Improved sales from the omni-channel programs that we report under our Retail Division partially offset the growth in product sales from our Business Solutions Division - see discussion on order online for pick up in stores or ship from stores within the Retail Division analysis. Product sales declined 6% from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to competitive pressures, customer losses in the contract sales channel, lower catalog sales through our call centers and the impact of increasing levels of sales from the omni-channel programs. The Business Solutions Division sales in 2017 were also affected by one less selling week compared to 2016, resulting in approximately $56 million of lower sales, and the impact of three powerful hurricanes that disrupted our retail and contract operations.\nSales of services in our Business Solutions Division increased 16% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. This positive trend is the reflection of increased sales of our managed print and fulfillment services, and the expansion of our product subscriptions for toner and software.\nTable of Content\nBusiness Solutions Division operating income declined 7% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of sales operating income declined 53 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 22 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Higher selling, general and administrative expenses from investments in our eCommerce platform, demand generation activities and acquisitions costs impacted operating income in 2018. However, these expenses were partially offset by an increase in gross profit primarily from acquisitions. Operating income in our Business Solutions Division was also negatively impacted by the migration of legacy OfficeMax customers to our current systems, which was completed in 2018. The decrease in operating income in 2017 was largely the result of having one less reporting week compared to fiscal 2016.\nRETAIL DIVISION\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Division operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in comparable store sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts sales in our Retail Division decreased 7% and 11% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. This was primarily the result of closing underperforming stores coupled with fewer transactions in the existing locations, a trend that we have partially offset by gradually increasing the volume of omni-channel transactions, whereby our Business Solutions Division customers order online for pick up in our stores. These transactions are included in our Retail Division's sales as they are fulfilled with store inventory and serviced by Retail Division employees.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Buy Online-Pickup in Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales of services within our Retail Division in 2018 were 1% higher compared to 2017. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, which requires that our third-party software sales be reported on a net basis, negatively affected the comparability of our sales of services by $53 million year-over-year. This change in presentation had no impact to the timing of recognition, gross profit, earnings or cash flows. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, sales of services in 2018 actually increased 11% from 2017 due to the expansion of our copy and print services, subscription services, and the introduction of new technology services offered to our retail customers by our store associates.\nIn 2017, sales of services decreased 15% compared to 2016 primarily because of store closures, lower store traffic and the business disruption associated with the three powerful hurricanes that occurred in the year.\nComparable store sales in 2018 decreased 4%, reflecting lower store traffic and transaction counts, partially offset by an increase in improved conversion rate and higher volume of omni-channel, online transactions for pick up in stores or ship from stores described above. Comparable store sales decreased across most of our primary product categories, including ink, supplies, computers and technology related products. Sales of paper and toner remained relatively flat year-over-year. On a comparable store sales basis, revenues related to our copy and print services increased 3% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The 5% comparable store sales decline in 2017 reflect lower store traffic, transaction counts and average order values, partially offset by an improved conversion rate, sales transfers from closed stores into stores that remained open and higher sales from the success of our omni-channel programs compared to 2016. Our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year. Stores are removed from the comparable sales calculation one month prior to closing, as sales during that period are largely non-comparable clearance activity. Stores are also removed from the comparable store sales calculation during periods of store remodeling, store closures due to hurricanes or natural disasters, or if significantly downsized. Our measure of comparable store sales has been applied consistently across periods but may differ from measures used by other companies.\nThe Retail Division operating income declined 24% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 15% from 2016 to 2017. This was mostly attributable to the flow-through impact of lower sales and gross margin rate, partially offset by lower dollars spent for selling, general, and administrative expenses, including payroll and other store expenses from both store closures and increased efficiency. The Division's operating income in 2018 also reflects the impact of investments in additional service capabilities, including targeted advertising, sales training and various customer-oriented initiatives. The impact of one less week in 2017 resulted in approximately $14 million of lower operating income for the Retail Division in 2017 compared to 2016. However, operating income as a percentage of sales remained relatively consistent year-over-year.\nTable of Content\nAt the end of 2018, the Retail Division operated 1,361 retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Store opening and closing activity for the last three years has been as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Open at\nBeginning\nof Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Closed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Opened\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Open at\nEnd\nof Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOf the two retail stores newly opened in 2018, one was opened in our corporate headquarters in Boca Raton, FL to solely serve our corporate headquarters employees, and one was opened to replace a closed location in Deerfield, IL.

Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The total sales increase in 2018 was primarily due to a full year of our CompuCom Division's operating results. Total sales in our CompuCom Division in 2018 were affected by lower business volume from one of its largest customers currently experiencing a significant reorganization. The CompuCom Division's operating income in 2018 was also affected by lower gross margin on product sales mix, and higher expenses associated with onboarding new customers and other growth initiatives.\nOTHER\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain operations previously included in the International Division, including our global sourcing and trading operations in the Asia/Pacific region, which we have retained, are presented as Other.

The analysis includes estimates of store-level sales, gross margins, direct expenses, exercise of future lease renewal options where applicable, and resulting cash flows and, by their nature, include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance. If the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying value of its assets, the assets are written down to estimated fair value.\nThe projections prepared for the 2018 analysis assumed declining sales over the forecast period. Gross margin and operating cost assumptions have been held at levels consistent with recent actual results and planned activities. The present value of our cash flows projections was determined using a 7% discount rate, which reflects a reduction in our cost of capital and balance sheet de-leverage in 2018. The impairment charges include amounts to bring the location's assets to estimated fair value based on projected operating cash flows or residual value, as appropriate. We continue to capitalize additions to previously-impaired operating stores and test for subsequent impairment.\nWe will continue to evaluate initiatives to improve performance and lower operating costs. To the extent that forward-looking sales and operating assumptions are not achieved and are subsequently reduced, or in certain circumstances, even if performance is as anticipated, additional impairment charges may result.\nMerger and restructuring expenses (income), net\nMerger and restructuring expenses, net was $72 million in 2018 compared to $94 million in 2017. Merger and restructuring expenses in 2018 include $46 million of severance, retention, transaction and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CompuCom and the other businesses, $10 million of expenses related to OfficeMax merger activities, which were completed in 2018, $11 million of expenses associated with our strategic transformation plan, and $5 million of expenses associated with our Comprehensive Business Review program.\nIn 2016, we announced the results of a comprehensive business review (the Comprehensive Business Review\u201d), which included the closure of up to 300 stores in North America over a three-year period, and the reduction of operating and general and administrative expenses through efficiencies and organizational optimization. Under the Comprehensive Business Review, we closed a total of 154 stores (19 in 2018, 63 in 2017 and 72 in 2016). We expect to close approximately 50 additional stores through the end of the program in 2019, and anticipate spending approximately $10 million in connection with these store closures.\nRefer to Note 3. Merger and Restructuring Activity\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for an extensive analysis of these Corporate charges.\nTable of Content\nLegal Expense Accrual\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a $25 million legal expense accrual in connection with certain settlement discussions we have undertaken with the Federal Trade Commission during the quarter. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUnallocated Expenses\nWe allocate to our Divisions functional support expenses that are considered to be directly or closely related to segment activity. These allocated expenses are included in the measurement of Division operating income. Other companies may charge more or less for functional support expenses to their segments, and our results, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The unallocated expenses primarily consist of the buildings used for our corporate headquarters and personnel not directly supporting the Divisions, including certain executive, finance, legal, audit and similar functions. Unallocated expenses also include the pension credit related to the frozen OfficeMax pension and other benefit plans. Additionally, the pension plan in the United Kingdom that has been retained by us in connection with the sale of the European Business, as well as certain general and administrative costs previously allocated to the International Division that have been excluded from the discontinued operations measurement have been included in corporate unallocated expenses.\nUnallocated expenses were $93 million, $96 million, and $112 million in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Unallocated expenses remained relatively flat in 2018 when compared to 2017. The decreases in 2017 when compared to 2016 primarily resulted from savings associated with our Comprehensive Business Review and lower incentive expenses associated with our overall performance in 2017, partially offset by certain executive transition expenses.\nOther Income and Expense\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (121\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment and modification of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income includes $19 million in 2018, $20 million in 2017 and $20 million in 2016, related to the Timber notes receivable, including amortization of the fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting. Interest expense includes non-recourse debt interest, including amortization of the fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting, amounting to $18 million in 2018, $18 million in 2017 and $19 million in 2016. Refer to Note 10. Timber Notes/Non-Recourse Debt,\u201d and Note 11. Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into a $750 million Term Loan Credit Agreement, due 2022. Borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement were issued with an original issue discount, at an issue price of 97.00%, and incurred interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 7.00%. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into the First Amendment to reduce the interest rate from LIBOR plus 7.00% to LIBOR plus 5.25%. In connection with the applicable interest rate reduction, we also made a voluntary repayment under the Term Loan Credit Agreement in the amount of $194 million. As a result, we recognized a $15 million loss on modification of debt, which consists of a 1% prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount in an amount proportional to the term loan repaid. We recorded $70 million and $10 million of interest expense in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nIn 2016, interest expense related to certain senior notes, which were redeemed in the third quarter of that year. In connection with the redemption of the 2016 senior notes, we recognized a $15 million loss on modification of debt.\nDiscontinued Operations\nRefer to Note 18. Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (220\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> Income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable of Content\nOur effective income tax rate in 2018 differs from the statutory rate of 21% enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act primarily due to the impact of excess tax deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation awards, a potential nondeductible legal settlement, the impact of state taxes and certain other nondeductible items, and the mix of income and losses across U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. As prior years' equity awards granted at a higher fair value vest, previously recognized deferred tax benefits on the excess compensation expense are reversed, thus causing a tax deficiency. In addition, we completed several acquisitions and dispositions, some of which resulted in the recognition of gain or loss for tax purposes that differed from the amount recognized for GAAP purposes. Our effective tax rate in 2017 varied considerably as a result of three primary factors, 1) the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2) the mix of income and losses across U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 3) the reduction of previously established valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate in 2016 varied considerably as a result of two primary factors, 1) the mix of income and losses across U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 2) the reduction of previously established valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. During 2018 and 2017, the mix of income and losses across jurisdictions, although still applicable, has become less of a factor in influencing our effective tax rates due to the dispositions of the international businesses and improved operating results. In addition, during 2017 and 2016, a large portion of our deferred tax assets that previously were not realizable, became realizable, thereby, causing significant reductions in previously established valuation allowances. As a result, our effective tax rates were 37% in 2018, 51% in 2017 and (48%) in 2016.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and includes, but is not limited to, significant changes to U.S. federal tax law including a U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, changes to the U.S. federal taxation of foreign sourced earnings and a one-time deemed repatriation transition tax. In accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes\u201d, the impact of a change in tax law is recorded in the period of enactment. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded a material, non-cash, change in our deferred income tax balances of approximately $68 million related to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction. We estimate that our deemed repatriation transition tax liability will not be material due to our limited international operations.\nAlso, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d), which provides guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period not to exceed twelve months for companies to complete this accounting. In 2018, we concluded that the remeasurement of deferred income tax balances recorded in 2017 did not materially change. Additionally, we reaffirmed our estimate of deemed repatriation transition tax liability will not be material due to our limited international operations.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017 and 2016, we concluded that it was more likely than not that a benefit from a significant portion of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets would be realized. This conclusion was based on detailed evaluations of all available positive and negative evidence and the weight of such evidence, the current financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, and the expectation of continued earnings. We determined that our U.S. federal and state valuation allowance should be reduced by approximately $40 million in 2017, with approximately $37 million in the third quarter of 2017 as a discrete non-cash income tax benefit and the remainder as an adjustment to the estimated annual effective tax rate. We determined that approximately $382 million of our U.S. federal and state valuation allowance should be reduced in 2016.\nWe continue to have a U.S. valuation allowance for certain U.S. federal credits and state tax attributes, which relate to deferred tax assets that require certain types of income or for income to be earned in certain jurisdictions in order to be realized. We will continue to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets in the U.S. and remaining foreign jurisdictions in future periods. Changes in pretax income projections could impact this evaluation in future periods.\nDue to the completion of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS\u201d) examination for 2014, our balance of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $4 million during 2016, which did impact income tax expense by $3 million due to an offsetting change in valuation allowance. As part of the CompuCom acquisition, our unrecognized tax benefits increased by $8 million in 2017. Approximately $3 million of the unrecognized tax benefit is currently covered under an indemnification agreement with a predecessor owner of CompuCom.\nIt is not reasonably possible that certain tax positions will be resolved within the next 12 months. Additionally, we anticipate that it is reasonably possible that new issues will be raised or resolved by tax authorities that may require changes to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits; however, an estimate of such changes cannot reasonably be made.\nWe file a U.S. federal income tax return and other income tax returns in various states and foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal and state and local income tax examinations for years before 2017 and 2013, respectively. The acquired OfficeMax U.S. consolidated group is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination and with few exceptions, is no longer subject to U.S. state and local income tax examinations for years before 2013. Our U.S. federal income tax return for 2017 is currently under review. Generally, we are subject to routine examination for years 2012 and forward in our international tax jurisdictions.\nRefer to Note 6. Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional tax discussion.\nTable of Content\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity\nAt December 29, 2018, we had $658 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $36 million from December 30, 2017. In addition, at the end of fiscal 2018 we had $947 million of available credit under the Amended Credit Agreement based on the December 2018 borrowing base certificate, for a total liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion, as compared to $1.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, availability of funds under the Amended Credit Agreement, and full year cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayments, common stock repurchases, cash dividends on common stock, merger integration and restructuring expenses, and future acquisitions consistent with our strategic growth initiatives for at least twelve months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNo amounts were drawn under the Amended Credit Agreement during 2018 and there were no amounts outstanding at December 29, 2018. There were letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement at the end of 2018 totaling $73 million and we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants as of December 29, 2018.\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2018, we acquired six small independent regional office supply distribution businesses and an enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider in the United States. The aggregate total purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, for the acquisitions completed in 2018 was approximately $114 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. The aggregate purchase price was primarily funded with cash on hand, with the remainder consisting of contingent consideration of approximately $28 million, the majority of which will be paid in the first quarter of 2019. No additional debt obligations were incurred as part of these transactions.\nIn November 2017, we purchased CompuCom for approximately $937 million, which was funded with a new $750 million 5-year Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 11. Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), approximately 44 million shares of our common stock with an approximate market value of $135 million, and approximately $52 million of cash on hand.\nIn addition to the acquisitions disclosed herein, we have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and assets. Such transactions may be material and may involve cash, our securities or the incurrence of additional indebtedness (Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).\nFinancing\nThe loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, which were issued with an original issue discount, at an issue price of 97.00%, incurred interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 7.00%. In November 2018, we entered into the First Amendment to reduce the applicable interest rate from LIBOR plus 7.00% to LIBOR plus 5.25%. All other material provisions of the Term Loan Credit Agreement remain unchanged. In connection with the applicable interest rate reduction, we also made a voluntary repayment under the Term Loan Credit Agreement in the amount of $194 million. We expect the reduction of the applicable interest rate margin coupled with the voluntary repayment on the amended Term Loan Credit Agreement will allow us to reduce our interest expense by approximately $21 million in 2019 and $79 million over the remaining life of the term loan (before transaction-related costs).\nThe loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement amortize quarterly beginning March 15, 2018 at the rate of approximately $19 million per quarter, with the balance payable at maturity. The Term Loan Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments in connection with certain asset sales as well as potential additional mandatory prepayments from specified percentages of our excess cash flow, subject to certain exceptions. Additionally, the Term Loan Credit Agreement requires the Company to pay a prepayment premium of 1.00% if the loans thereunder are voluntarily repaid after the first anniversary of the closing date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement but on or prior to the second anniversary of the closing date of the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nThe Term Loan Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties, events of default, and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for similar financings and which include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends subject to compliance with an annual limit, repurchase common stock, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets, and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, a minimum liquidity maintenance covenant, requiring us and our restricted subsidiaries to retain unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and availability under our Amended Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of at least $400 million, will apply at any time that our senior secured leverage ratio under the agreement is greater than 1.50:1.00 as calculated quarterly. At December 29, 2018, the Company's senior secured leverage ratio was 0.99:1.00 and the Company was in compliance with the agreement.\nTable of Content\nCapital Expenditures\nIn 2019, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $175 million, including investments to support our critical priorities and redesign the layout of our stores to enhance our in-store experience. These expenditures will be funded through available cash on hand and operating cash flows.\nShare Repurchases\nOn May 27, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock, par value $0.01 per share. In July 2016, our Board of Directors authorized increasing the current common stock repurchase program from $100 million to $250 million. The stock repurchase authorization permits us to repurchase stock from time-to-time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, 10b5-1 trading plans, accelerated stock repurchase transactions and/or other derivative transactions. The current authorization expired on December 31, 2018. In November 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program of up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock effective January 1, 2019, which extends until the end of 2020 and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The exact number and timing of share repurchases will depend on market conditions and other factors, and will be funded through available cash balances. Our ability to repurchase our common stock in 2019 is subject to certain restrictions under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nUnder the original stock repurchase program, we purchased approximately 14 million shares at cost of $39 million in 2018. On December 31, 2018, the current stock repurchase authorization expired. The Board of Directors authorized $100 million for additional purchases under the new stock repurchase program effective January 1, 2019.\nDividends\nOn February 5, 2019, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.025 per share, payable on March 15, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019. The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains certain restrictions on our ability to declare or pay dividends.\nCash Flows\nCash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities of continuing operations is summarized as follows:\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (249\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,030\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (414\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (475\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities from Continuing Operations\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased by $149 million during 2018 when compared to 2017. This was driven by favorable changes in working capital of $260 million, partially offset by lower net income from continuing operations of $47 million. The improvement in working capital is primarily associated with extended payment terms on our accounts payable coupled with improved collections on our accounts receivable. These improvements in working capital were partially offset by a large reduction in inventory levels in 2017 compared to 2018, when the number of store closures was substantially lower than the prior two years. Cash flows from operating activities includes outflows related to merger, restructuring, and integration activity.\nCash provided by operating activities of continuing operations decreased by $25 million in 2017 when compared to 2016. The decrease in operating cash is primarily the result of 2016 operating cash flows including the receipt of the $250 million of termination fees related to the terminated Staples acquisition partially offset by a $204 million lower use of cash related to changes in the level of net working capital in 2017 compared to 2016.\nThe timing of changes in working capital is subject to variability during the year and across years depending on a variety of factors, including period end sales, the flow of goods, credit terms, timing of promotions, vendor production planning, new product introductions and working capital management. For our accounting policy on cash management, refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInvesting Activities from Continuing Operations\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $249 million in 2018, primarily driven by $187 million in investments made in our service platform, eCommerce, and capabilities across our retail and distribution network, the inclusion of a full year of capital expenditures associated with our CompuCom Division, and $81 million in business acquisitions net of cash acquired and contingent consideration liabilities. These cash outflows from investing activities were partially offset by net cash proceeds of $15 million associated with the disposal of non-strategic assets.\nTable of Content\nCash used in investing activities of continuing operations was $1.0 billion in 2017, primarily driven by $872 million of cash used for business acquisitions, including CompuCom, as well as $141 million in capital expenditures. In 2017 we also purchased our corporate headquarters for $134 million in cash, of which $42 million was reflected as an outflow from investing activities of continuing operations, with the remainder presented in financing activities of continuing operations. These cash outflows from investing activities were partially offset by net cash proceeds of $30 million associated with the disposal of non-strategic assets.\nFinancing Activities from Continuing Operations\nCash used in financing activities of continuing operations was $414 million in 2018, reflecting $97 million net repayments on long and short-term borrowings and a $194 million voluntary partial repayment of our Term Loan Credit Agreement. Cash dividends and repurchases of common stock in 2018 were $55 million and $39 million, respectively. We also used $18 million in cash to acquire a non-controlling equity interest of a subsidiary related to the CompuCom acquisition. We sold this subsidiary in December 2018, and the net cash proceeds were included in the $15 million net cash proceeds associated with the disposal of non-strategic assets described above in investing activities from continuing operations.\nCash provided by financing activities of continuing operations was $473 million in 2017, primarily driven by the cash financing received from the Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into to fund the acquisition of CompuCom. This cash inflow was partially offset by $92 million of cash used to extinguish the capital lease obligation associated with the purchase of our corporate headquarters, $53 in cash dividends, and $56 million in repurchases of common stock.\nDiscontinued Operations\nCash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations is summarized as follows:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash flows from operating activity of discontinued operations reflect cash movements between continuing operating and discontinued operating entities up until the sale of the individual businesses included in the disposal group. All intercompany transactions between discontinued and continuing operating entities are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe change in operating cash flows of discontinued operations in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the impact of the sale of our former businesses in Australia and New Zealand in 2018. The change in operating cash flows of discontinued operations in 2017 compared to 2016 reflects the impact of the sale of the businesses in South Korea and mainland China during 2017, as well as the sale of our European Business during 2016.\nCash flows provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2018 reflect the sale of our former businesses in Australia and New Zealand, net of $6 million paid for professional fees and other closing costs. Cash flows used in investing activities of discontinued operations in 2017 include working capital adjustments related to the sale of our European Business, transaction costs and cash on hand transferred associated with the sale of the businesses in South Korea and mainland China, partially offset by funds received in 2017 from the sale of our South Korean business, and $8 million of cash received associated with the extension of the Oceania sale and purchase agreement during the third quarter of 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 29, 2018, we had retail stores and other facilities and equipment under operating lease agreements, which are included in the table below. Most of these will no longer be off-balance sheet arrangements with the adoption of the new leasing standard in 2019. Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the new leasing standard. In addition, Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes certain of our arrangements that contain indemnifications.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 29, 2018, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods. Some of the figures included in this table are based on management's estimates and assumptions about these obligations, including their duration, the possibility of renewal, anticipated actions by third parties and other factors. Because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective, the amounts we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table.\nTable of Content\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recourse debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-recourse debt (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Long-term debt obligations consist primarily of expected payments (principal and interest) on our $750 million term loan credit facility and $186 million of revenue bonds at various interest rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The present value of these obligations is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements.

If the obligation is non-cancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the table. If the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if cancelled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we can unilaterally terminate an agreement simply by providing a certain number of days notice or by paying a termination fee, we have included the amount of the termination fee or the amount that would be paid over the notice period.\u201d As of December 29, 2018, purchase obligations include marketing services, outsourced accounting services, certain fixed assets and software licenses, service and maintenance contracts for information technology and communication. Contracts that can be unilaterally terminated without a penalty have not been included.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2018 includes $300 million classified as Deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities. Deferred income taxes and other long-term liabilities primarily consist of net long-term deferred income taxes, deferred lease credits, long-term restructuring accruals, certain liabilities under our deferred compensation plans, accruals for uncertain tax positions, and environmental accruals. Certain of these liabilities have been excluded from the above table as either the amounts are fully funded or the timing and/or the amount of any cash payment is uncertain. Refer to Note 3. Merger and Restructuring Activity\u201d for a discussion of our restructuring accruals and Note 6. Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax positions and accruals for uncertain tax positions.\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 29, 2018 also includes $112 million of current and non-current pension and postretirement obligations, which is also excluded from the table above, as the timing of the cash payments is uncertain. Our estimate is that payments in future years will total $169 million. This estimate represents the minimum contributions required per Internal Revenue Service funding rules and our estimated future payments under pension and postretirement plans. Actuarially-determined liabilities related to pension and postretirement benefits are recorded based on estimates and assumptions. Key factors used in developing estimates of these liabilities include assumptions related to discount rates, rates of return on investments, healthcare cost trends, benefit payment patterns and other factors. Changes in assumptions related to the measurement of funded status could have a material impact on the amount reported. Refer to Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition to the above, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $73 million at December 29, 2018.\nTable of Content\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies and estimates have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements. A summary of significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We have also identified certain accounting policies and estimates that we consider critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and we have provided below additional information on those policies. Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 4. Revenue Recognition\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the significant changes made for adopting the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. No other significant changes have been made during the three years-ended 2018 to the methodologies used in preparing the estimates discussed below.\nInventory valuation - Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market value. We monitor active inventory for excessive quantities and slow-moving items and record adjustments as necessary to lower the value if the anticipated realizable amount is below cost. We also identify merchandise that we plan to discontinue or have begun to phase out and assess the estimated recoverability of the carrying value. This includes consideration of the quantity of the merchandise, the rate of sale, and our assessment of current and projected market conditions and anticipated vendor programs. If necessary, we record a charge to cost of sales to reduce the carrying value of this merchandise to our estimate of the lower of cost or realizable amount. Additional promotional activities may be initiated, and markdowns may be taken as considered appropriate until the product is sold or otherwise disposed. Estimates and judgments are required in determining what items to stock and at what level, and what items to discontinue and how to value them prior to sale.\nWe also recognize an expense in cost of sales for our estimate of physical inventory loss from theft, short shipments and other factors - referred to as inventory shrink. During the year, we adjust the estimate of our inventory shrink rate accrual following on-hand adjustments and our physical inventory count results. These changes in estimates may result in volatility within the year or impact comparisons to other periods.\nVendor arrangements - Inventory purchases from vendors are generally under arrangements that automatically renew until cancelled with periodic updates or annual negotiated agreements. Many of these arrangements require the vendors to make payments to us or provide credits to be used against purchases if and when certain conditions are met. We refer to these arrangements as vendor programs.\u201d Vendor programs fall into two broad categories, with some underlying sub-categories. The first category is volume-based rebates. Under those arrangements, our product costs per unit decline as higher volumes of purchases are reached. Current accounting rules provide that companies with a reasonable basis for estimating their full year purchases, and therefore the ultimate rebate level, can use that estimate to value inventory and cost of goods sold throughout the year. We believe our history of purchases with many vendors provides us with a basis for our estimates of purchase volume. If the anticipated volume of purchases is not reached, however, or if we form the belief at any point in the year that it is not likely to be reached, cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory balances are adjusted to reflect that change in our outlook. We review sales projections and related purchases against vendor program estimates at least quarterly and adjust these balances accordingly.\nThe second broad category of arrangements with our vendors is event-based programs. These arrangements can take many forms, including advertising support, special pricing offered by certain of our vendors for a limited time, payments for special placement or promotion of a product, reimbursement of costs incurred to launch a vendor's product, and various other special programs. These payments are classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold or inventory, based on the nature of the program and the sell-through of the inventory. Some arrangements may meet the specific, incremental, identifiable cost criteria that allow for direct operating expense offset, but such arrangements are not significant.\nVendor programs are recognized throughout the year based on judgment and estimates and amounts due from vendors are generally settled throughout the year based on purchase volumes. The final amounts not already collected from vendors are generally known soon after year-end and are reflected in our results of operations. Substantially all vendor program receivables outstanding at the end of the year are settled within the three months following year-end. We believe that our historical collection rates of these receivables provide a sound basis for our estimates of anticipated vendor payments throughout the year.\nLong-lived asset impairments - Long-lived assets with identifiable cash flows are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We assess recovery of the asset or asset groups using estimates of cash flows directly associated with the future use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset groups. If anticipated cash flows are insufficient to recover the asset on an undiscounted basis, impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's estimated fair value (generally, the discounted cash flows or its salvage value) and its carrying value, and any costs of disposition. Factors that could trigger an impairment assessment include, among others, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. As restructuring activities continue, we may identify assets or asset groups for sale or abandonment and incur impairment charges.\nTable of Content\nBecause of declining sales, store assets are reviewed periodically throughout the year for recoverability of their asset carrying amounts. The frequency of this test may change in future periods if performance warrants. The analysis uses input from retail store operations and our accounting and finance personnel that organizationally report to the Chief Financial Officer. These projections are based on our estimates of store-level sales, gross margins, direct expenses, and resulting cash flows and, by their nature, include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance. Store asset impairment charges of $6 million, $2 million and $8 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are included in Asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Based on the fourth quarter 2018 analysis, a 100-basis point further decrease in next year sales, combined with a 50-basis point decrease in gross margin from the rates utilized in our analysis, would have increased the impairment charge by less than $1 million. Further, a 100-basis point decrease in sales for all periods would have increased the impairment charge by less than $1 million.\nImportant assumptions used in these projections include an assessment of future overall economic conditions, our ability to control future costs, maintain aspects of positive performance, and successfully implement initiatives designed to enhance sales and gross margins. To the extent our estimates of future performance are not realized, future assessments could result in material impairment charges.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. We review the carrying amount of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of the first day of our third quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances suggest that goodwill may not be recoverable. For reporting units in which our qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further impairment testing is performed. For those reporting units where events or change in circumstances indicate that potential impairment indicators exist, we perform a quantitative assessment to test goodwill. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. In addition, when indicators of impairment exist, we perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether the carrying amount of goodwill can be recovered. We typically use a combination of different valuation approaches that are dependent on several significant assumptions, including subjective estimates of revenue growth rates, gross margin, and expenses. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test using a quantitative assessment that combined the income approach and the market approach valuation methodologies. As a result, we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their respective carrying amount as of the assessment date, which was the first day of the quarter. The fair value of the CompuCom and Contract reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts by 17% and 13%, respectively. These represented the lowest fair value margins of all reporting units tested, which is attributable to the timing of assigning a fair value to the recent acquisitions included in these reporting units. Given the performance of the CompuCom reporting unit, combined with our limited history of forecasting its business, in the fourth quarter of 2018 we performed an interim impairment test for CompuCom which reflected revised long-term projections. As a result, we concluded that the fair value of our CompuCom reporting unit exceeded its carrying amounts by 4% as of December 29, 2018. Notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions used for the projected financial information, long-term growth rate and weighted-average cost of capital in our updated impairment test are reasonable, we performed a sensitivity analysis. The results of this analysis revealed that if the long-term growth rate for CompuCom decreased by 100 basis points, the fair value of the reporting unit would be impaired by approximately $20 million. Alternatively, if the weighted-average cost of capital increased by 100 basis points, the fair value of the reporting unit would be impaired by approximately $60 million. Variation to the critical assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including changes in projected revenue growth rates, gross margin or expenses may result in materially different calculations of fair value that could lead to the recognition of significant impairment charges in future periods.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, are tested at least annually for impairment whereas definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed to ensure the remaining useful lives are appropriate. An impairment analysis may be conducted between annual tests if events or circumstances suggest an intangible asset may not be recoverable. During 2018, we recognized $1 million of impairment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets because of the phase out of one of our brand offerings.\nOther intangible assets primarily include favorable lease assets, customer relationship values, trade names and technology. The favorable lease assets were established in the OfficeMax merger for individual leases with rental rates below current market rates for comparable properties and assumed renewal of all available options. The favorable lease assets are being amortized over the same periods used in estimating their fair value. Should we decide to close a facility prior to the full contemplated term, recovery of the intangible asset will be subject to then-current sublease prospects. During 2017, we recognized $2 million of impairment of favorable lease assets because of closure activity.\nTable of Content\nAt December 29, 2018, the net carrying amount of customer relationships totaled $324 million, and primarily related to the CompuCom acquisition and OfficeMax merger. The original valuation assumed continuation of attrition rates previously experienced with these businesses and synergy benefits from the transactions. If we experience an unanticipated decline in sales or profitability associated with these customers, the remaining useful life will be reassessed and could result in either acceleration of amortization or impairment.\nAccounting for Business Combination\nWe include the results of operations of acquired businesses in our consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition. Total purchase consideration of acquired businesses may include contingent consideration based on the future results of operations of the acquired businesses. Significant judgements are required to estimate the future results of operations of the acquired businesses and the contingent consideration. Differences between the actual results of operations of the acquired businesses and the original estimate may result in additional contingent consideration liabilities. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration may result in additional transaction related expenses. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. We use various valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including using a market participant perspective when applying cost, income and relief from royalty analyses, supplemented with market appraisals where appropriate. Significant judgments and estimates are required in preparing these fair value estimates. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and us and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nSIGNIFICANT TRENDS, DEVELOPMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nCompetitive Factors - Over the years, we have seen continued development and growth of competitors in all segments of our business. In particular, internet-based companies, mass merchandisers and warehouse clubs, as well as grocery and drugstore chains, have increased their assortment of home office merchandise, attracting additional back-to-school customers and year-round casual shoppers. We have seen substantial growth in the number of competitors that offer office products over the internet, as well as the breadth and depth of their product offerings. In addition to large numbers of smaller internet providers featuring special price incentives and one-time deals (such as close-outs), we are experiencing strong competitive pressures from large internet providers such as Amazon and Walmart that offer a full assortment of office products through direct sales and, in the case of Amazon, acting as a storefront\u201d for other specialty office product providers.\nWarehouse clubs have expanded beyond their in-store assortment by adding catalogs and websites from which a much broader assortment of products may be ordered. We also face competition from other office supply stores that compete directly with us in numerous markets. This competition is likely to result in increased competitive pressures on pricing, product selection and services provided by our Retail and Business Solutions Divisions. Many of these retail competitors, including discounters, warehouse clubs, and drug stores and grocery chains, carry basic office supply products. Some of them also feature technology products. Many of them may price certain of these offerings lower than we do, but they have not shown an indication of greatly expanding their somewhat limited product offerings at this time. This trend towards a proliferation of retailers offering a limited assortment of office products is a potentially serious trend that could shift purchasing away from office supply specialty retailers and adversely impact our results. Another trend in our office products industry has been consolidation, as competitors in office supply stores and the copy/print channel have been acquired and consolidated into larger, well-capitalized corporations. This trend towards consolidation, coupled with acquisitions by financially strong organizations, is potentially a significant trend in our office products industry that could impact our results. Additionally, consumers are utilizing more technology and purchasing less paper, ink and toner, physical file storage and general office supplies. Lower demand for printing paper is causing a decline in manufacturing and ensuing industry supply of paper products. This in turn is leading to a meaningful increase in paper cost, which we are not always able to pass along to our customers commensurably.\nOur CompuCom Division also operates in an environment that is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting client needs and expectations. We compete with companies that provide IT services and outsourcing, as well as companies that sell IT related products.\nWe regularly consider these and other competitive factors when we establish both offensive and defensive aspects of our overall business strategy and operating plans.\nEconomic Factors - Our customers in the Retail Division and certain of our customers in the Business Solutions and CompuCom Divisions are small and home office businesses. Accordingly, spending by these customers is affected by macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in the housing market and commodity costs, credit availability and other factors.\nTable of Content\nLiquidity Factors - We rely on our cash flow from operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and access to broad financial markets to provide the liquidity we need to operate our business and fund integration and restructuring activities. Together, these sources have been used to fund operating and working capital needs, as well as invest in business expansion through capital improvements and acquisitions. While we have in place a $1.2 billion asset-based credit facility to provide liquidity, the economic factors affecting our business may limit our ability to access this credit facility in full or cause future refinancing terms to be less favorable than the terms of our current indebtedness.\nMARKET SENSITIVE RISKS AND POSITIONS\nWe have adopted an enterprise risk management process patterned after the principles set out by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO). We utilize a common view of exposure identification and risk management. A process is in place for periodic risk reviews and identification of appropriate mitigation strategies.\nWe have market risk exposure related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodities. Market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings, cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year. Interest rate changes on obligations may result from external market factors, as well as changes in our credit rating. We manage our exposure to market risks at the corporate level. The portfolio of interest-sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored to provide liquidity necessary to satisfy anticipated short-term needs. Our risk management policies allow the use of specified financial instruments for hedging purposes only; speculation on interest rates, foreign currency rates, or commodities is not permitted.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, debt obligations, and defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.\nThe impact on cash and cash equivalents held at December 29, 2018 from a hypothetical 50-basis point change in interest rates would be an increase or decrease in interest income of approximately $3 million. The impact on our term loan at December 29, 2018 from a hypothetical 50-basis point change in interest rates would be an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately $2 million.\nThe following table provides information about our debt portfolio outstanding as of December 29, 2018, that is sensitive to changes in interest rates. The following table does not include our obligations for pension plans and other postretirement benefits, although market risk also arises within our defined benefit pension plans to the extent that the obligations of the pension plans are not fully matched by assets with determinable cash flows. Refer to Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Risk\nSensitivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nAmount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Risk\nSensitivity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Timber notes receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial liabilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recourse debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term Loan, due 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue bonds, due in varying amounts\nperiodically through\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> American & Foreign Power Company, Inc.\n5% debentures,\ndue 2030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-recourse debt - Timber notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risk sensitivity of fixed rate debt reflects the estimated increase in fair value from a 50-basis point decrease in interest rates, calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. The sensitivity of variable rate debt reflects the possible increase in interest expense during the next period from a 50-basis point change in interest rates prevailing at year-end.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nWe conduct business through entities in Canada, Mexico, India, Costa Rica and China, where their functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. We continue to assess our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. As of December 29, 2018, a 10% change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our pretax earnings of approximately $2 million.\nTable of Content\nCommodities Risk\nWe operate a large network of stores and delivery centers. As such, we purchase fuel needed to transport products to our stores and customers as well as pay shipping costs to import products from overseas. We are exposed to potential changes in the underlying commodity costs associated with this transport activity.\nWe enter into economic hedge transactions for a portion of our anticipated fuel consumption. These arrangements are marked to market at each reporting period. Some of these arrangements may not be designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in value are recognized in current earnings through the Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Those that are designated as hedges for accounting purposes are also marked to market at each reporting period, with the change in value deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the related fuel is consumed. At December 29, 2018, we had entered into contracts for approximately two million gallons of fuel that will be settled by January 2020. Currently, these economic hedging transactions are not considered material. As of December 29, 2018, excluding the impact of any hedge transaction, a 10% change in domestic commodity costs would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our operating profit of approximately $5 million.\nINFLATION AND SEASONALITY\nAlthough we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business, we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our sales or the results of our operations. Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality, with sales generally trending lower in the second quarter, following the back-to-business\u201d sales cycle in the first quarter and preceding the back-to-school\u201d sales cycle in the third quarter and the holiday sales cycle in the fourth quarter for the Retail and Business Solutions Divisions. The CompuCom Division generally does not experience notable seasonality. Certain working capital components may build and recede during the year reflecting established selling cycles. Business cycles can and have impacted our operations and financial position when compared to other periods.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a description of new applicable accounting standards, refer to Note 1.

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide information to assist readers in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We recommend reading this MD&A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nWe are a leading provider of business services and supplies, products and technology solutions through our fully integrated business-to-business ( B2B\u201d) distribution platform of 1,361 retail stores, online presence, and dedicated sales professionals and technicians to retail consumers and small, medium and enterprise businesses. Through our banner brands Office Depot\u00ae, OfficeMax\u00ae, CompuCom\u00ae and Grand&Toy\u00ae, we offer our customers the tools and resources they need to focus on their passion of starting, growing and running their business.\nAt December 29, 2018, our operations are organized into three reportable segments (or Divisions\u201d): Business Solutions Division, Retail Division and CompuCom Division.\nThe Business Solutions Division or BSD provides customers with office supply products and services in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada through dedicated sales forces, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our Internet websites.\nThe Retail Division includes our chain of retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where we sell office supplies, technology products and solutions, business machines and related supplies, print, cleaning, breakroom supplies and facilities products, and furniture. In addition, our Retail Division offers a range of business-related services targeted to small businesses, technology support services as well as printing, copying, mailing and shipping services.\nThe CompuCom Division was formed during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. ( CompuCom\u201d). The CompuCom Division provides information technology ( IT\u201d) outsourcing services and products to enterprise organizations in the United States and Canada, and offers a broad range of solutions including end user computing support, managed IT services, data center monitoring and management, service desk, network infrastructure, IT workforce solutions, mobile device management and cloud services.\nAcquisitions\nOver the last two years, we have been undergoing a strategic transformation to pivot Office Depot into an integrated B2B distribution platform, with the objective of expanding our product offerings to include value-added services for our customers and capture greater market share.\nAs part of this transformation, we acquired CompuCom in 2017 and an enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider in 2018. The latter gives us access to a platform for selling or providing Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) related hardware and projects to the education market. IoT refers to the connection of intelligent systems and devices to allow them to automatically share information so that systems and devices work intelligently together to develop and enhance solutions and reduce human intervention.\nTo strengthen our core operations, over the last two years we have also expanded the reach of our distribution network by identifying and acquiring profitable regional office supply distribution businesses serving small and mid-market customers in geographic areas that were previously underserved by our network. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, for an effective and accretive means to expand our distribution reach, target new business customers and grow our offerings beyond traditional office supplies.\nThe aggregate total purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, for the seven acquisitions completed in 2018 was approximately $114 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. The aggregate purchase price was primarily funded with cash on hand, with the remainder consisting of contingent consideration estimated to be $28 million, the majority of which will be paid in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe operating results of these companies are combined with our operating results subsequent to their purchase dates. The operating results of the office supply distribution businesses we acquired are included in the Business Solutions Division segment, whereas the operating results of CompuCom and the enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider are included in the CompuCom Division. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable of Content\nDisposition of the International Division - Discontinued Operations\nIn September 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell substantially all of our international operations, formerly reported as the International Division through four disposal groups (Europe, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand ( Oceania\u201d) and mainland China).\nOn December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Europe (the European Business\u201d) to The AURELIUS Group (the Purchaser\u201d) and recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $108 million in 2016. We recorded approximately $8 million of additional costs associated with the sale during 2017. We retained the assets and obligations of a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom.\nWe completed the sale of our business in South Korea on April 26, 2017, and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $12 million. Additionally, we completed the sale of our business in mainland China on July 28, 2017, and recognized a cumulative loss of $9 million associated with the sale, of which $10 million was recognized in the first half of 2017 and was partially offset by a $1 million gain recognized at the time of sale. We retained the sourcing and trading operations of the former International Division, which are presented as Other in Note 5. Segment Information\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe completed the sale of our businesses in Australia on February 5, 2018, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $1 million. Additionally, we completed the sale of our business in New Zealand on May 4, 2018, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $3 million. With the sale of this last disposal group, the sale of the International Operations is complete, and there are no further discontinued operations at December 29, 2018.\nRefer to Note 18. Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOverview of 2018 Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations and Liquidity\nThe following summarizes the more significant factors impacting our operating results from continuing operations for the 52-week period ended December 29, 2018 (also referred to as 2018\u201d) and the 52-week period ended December 30, 2017 (also referred to as 2017\u201d) as well as our liquidity in 2018 and 2017.\nOur consolidated sales were 8% higher in 2018 compared to 2017 mostly as a result of including our CompuCom Division's sales for the full year in 2018. Our Business Solutions Division also contributed higher sales of $174 million, which represented an improvement from the prior year of 3% primarily from acquisitions. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower sales in our Retail Division, which decreased 6% year-over-year from lower comparable store sales and store closures.\n\n ** We formed the CompuCom Division as a result of our acquisition of CompuCom on November 8, 2017. The 2017 amount represents sales from the acquisition date of November 8, 2017 through the end of fiscal 2017. \nTable of Content\nProduct sales remained flat in 2018 compared to 2017, while service revenues grew 84%. Higher service revenues were driven primarily by the acquisition of CompuCom. Service revenues in 2018 were also impacted by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which negatively affected the comparability of service revenues by $57 million year-over-year. Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Excluding our CompuCom Division and the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard, service revenues grew 13% as a result of our strategic efforts to expand the array of enterprise and consumer service offerings. The primary drivers of our year-over-year growth in service revenues, excluding the CompuCom acquisition, include higher demand for our managed print and fulfillment services, and the expansion of our service and product subscriptions, with more than one million new subscriptions in 2018 generating over $100 million in sales. On a consolidated basis, services represent approximately 15% and 9% of our total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nOther Significant Factors Impacting Total Company Results and Liquidity\n \u2022 Total gross profit increased by $90 million or 4% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from lower sales in our retail stores. Total gross margin was approximately 80 basis points lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily attributable to store and supply chain deleverage. \n \u2022 Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $157 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase reflects $286 million associated with the acquired businesses, partially offset by $129 million related to retail stores closures, lower payroll expenses, operational efficiencies and synergies. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat in 2018 when compared to 2017. \n \u2022 We recorded $72 million of Merger and restructuring expenses, net in 2018 compared to $94 million in 2017. Merger and restructuring expense in 2018 includes $46 million of severance, retention, transaction and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CompuCom and the other businesses, $10 million of expenses related to OfficeMax merger activities, which were completed in 2018, $11 million of expenses associated with our strategic transformation plan, and $5 million of expenses associated with our Comprehensive Business Review program. Refer to Note 3. Merger and Restructuring Activity\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 We recorded a $25 million legal expense accrual in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with certain settlement discussions we have undertaken with the Federal Trade Commission in the quarter. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate of 37% in 2018 reflects the lowered Federal marginal tax rate of 21% as well as a mix of income and losses across US and non-US jurisdictions. In addition, our rate was impacted by several discrete items in the quarter including the impact of the potential nondeductible legal settlement and the impact of excess tax deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation awards, state taxes, and certain other nondeductible items. In addition, we completed several acquisitions and dispositions, some of which resulted in the recognition of a gain or loss for tax purposes that differed from the amount recognized for GAAP purposes. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 51%, primarily impacted by the reduction in the statutory effective Federal rate from 35% to 21% which caused a non-cash charge of $68 million, partially offset by the reversal of $42 million of our U.S. federal and state valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was more likely than not that a benefit from the related deferred tax assets would be realizable. \n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.18 in 2018 compared to $0.27 in 2017. \n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.01 in 2018 compared to $0.06 in 2017. \n \u2022 Including diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations, net diluted earnings per share was $0.19 in 2018 compared to $0.34 in 2017. As disclosed in Note 18 Discontinued Operations\u201d to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the sale of our former International Operations in the first half of 2018. \nTable of Content\n \u2022 At December 29, 2018, we had $658 million in cash and cash equivalents and $947 million available under the Amended Credit Agreement. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $616 million for 2018 compared to $467 million for 2017. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7 for more information on cash flows. \n \u2022 In 2017, we entered into a $750 million Term Loan Credit Agreement in connection with our acquisition of CompuCom. In November 2018, we executed the First Amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) to reduce the applicable interest rate from LIBOR plus 7.00% to LIBOR plus 5.25%. In connection with the applicable interest rate reduction, we made a voluntary repayment under the Term Loan Credit Agreement of $194 million. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a $15 million loss on modification of debt, which is comprised of a 1% prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount in an amount proportional to the term loan repaid. \n \u2022 During 2018 and 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock of $0.025 per share for a total annual dividend distribution of $55 million and $53 million, respectively. In addition, under our share repurchase program we bought back approximately 14 million shares of our common stock in each of the last two fiscal years, returning another $39 million in 2018 and $56 million in 2017 to our shareholders. \nOPERATING RESULTS\nDiscussion of additional income and expense items, including material charges and credits and changes in interest and income taxes follows our review of segment results. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 includes 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2016 includes 53 weeks, with a 14-week fourth quarter.\nBUSINESS SOLUTIONS DIVISION\n\nPrior to 2018, we also reported changes in sales for our Business Solutions Division on a constant currency basis given the span of our former international operations. As disclosed in Note 18 Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, between the third quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2018, we sold substantially all of our international operations. As a result, over the last two years the Business Solutions Division's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has been primarily limited to our Canadian operations, and the fluctuation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar has had an immaterial impact to the changes in sales for the Division for all periods herein presented.\nProduct sales from our Business Solutions Division increased 3% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to acquisitions, higher online sales and growth in adjacency categories, such as cleaning/breakroom supplies and furniture, partially offset by lower sales of other product categories including paper, toner and ink. Improved sales from the omni-channel programs that we report under our Retail Division partially offset the growth in product sales from our Business Solutions Division - see discussion on order online for pick up in stores or ship from stores within the Retail Division analysis. Product sales declined 6% from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to competitive pressures, customer losses in the contract sales channel, lower catalog sales through our call centers and the impact of increasing levels of sales from the omni-channel programs. The Business Solutions Division sales in 2017 were also affected by one less selling week compared to 2016, resulting in approximately $56 million of lower sales, and the impact of three powerful hurricanes that disrupted our retail and contract operations.\nSales of services in our Business Solutions Division increased 16% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. This positive trend is the reflection of increased sales of our managed print and fulfillment services, and the expansion of our product subscriptions for toner and software.\nTable of Content\nBusiness Solutions Division operating income declined 7% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of sales operating income declined 53 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 22 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Higher selling, general and administrative expenses from investments in our eCommerce platform, demand generation activities and acquisitions costs impacted operating income in 2018. However, these expenses were partially offset by an increase in gross profit primarily from acquisitions. Operating income in our Business Solutions Division was also negatively impacted by the migration of legacy OfficeMax customers to our current systems, which was completed in 2018. The decrease in operating income in 2017 was largely the result of having one less reporting week compared to fiscal 2016.\nRETAIL DIVISION\n\nProducts sales in our Retail Division decreased 7% and 11% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. This was primarily the result of closing underperforming stores coupled with fewer transactions in the existing locations, a trend that we have partially offset by gradually increasing the volume of omni-channel transactions, whereby our Business Solutions Division customers order online for pick up in our stores. These transactions are included in our Retail Division's sales as they are fulfilled with store inventory and serviced by Retail Division employees.\n\nSales of services within our Retail Division in 2018 were 1% higher compared to 2017. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, which requires that our third-party software sales be reported on a net basis, negatively affected the comparability of our sales of services by $53 million year-over-year. This change in presentation had no impact to the timing of recognition, gross profit, earnings or cash flows. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, sales of services in 2018 actually increased 11% from 2017 due to the expansion of our copy and print services, subscription services, and the introduction of new technology services offered to our retail customers by our store associates.\nIn 2017, sales of services decreased 15% compared to 2016 primarily because of store closures, lower store traffic and the business disruption associated with the three powerful hurricanes that occurred in the year.\nComparable store sales in 2018 decreased 4%, reflecting lower store traffic and transaction counts, partially offset by an increase in improved conversion rate and higher volume of omni-channel, online transactions for pick up in stores or ship from stores described above. Comparable store sales decreased across most of our primary product categories, including ink, supplies, computers and technology related products. Sales of paper and toner remained relatively flat year-over-year. On a comparable store sales basis, revenues related to our copy and print services increased 3% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The 5% comparable store sales decline in 2017 reflect lower store traffic, transaction counts and average order values, partially offset by an improved conversion rate, sales transfers from closed stores into stores that remained open and higher sales from the success of our omni-channel programs compared to 2016. Our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year. Stores are removed from the comparable sales calculation one month prior to closing, as sales during that period are largely non-comparable clearance activity. Stores are also removed from the comparable store sales calculation during periods of store remodeling, store closures due to hurricanes or natural disasters, or if significantly downsized. Our measure of comparable store sales has been applied consistently across periods but may differ from measures used by other companies.\nThe Retail Division operating income declined 24% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 15% from 2016 to 2017. This was mostly attributable to the flow-through impact of lower sales and gross margin rate, partially offset by lower dollars spent for selling, general, and administrative expenses, including payroll and other store expenses from both store closures and increased efficiency. The Division's operating income in 2018 also reflects the impact of investments in additional service capabilities, including targeted advertising, sales training and various customer-oriented initiatives. The impact of one less week in 2017 resulted in approximately $14 million of lower operating income for the Retail Division in 2017 compared to 2016. However, operating income as a percentage of sales remained relatively consistent year-over-year.\nTable of Content\nAt the end of 2018, the Retail Division operated 1,361 retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Store opening and closing activity for the last three years has been as follows:\n\nOf the two retail stores newly opened in 2018, one was opened in our corporate headquarters in Boca Raton, FL to solely serve our corporate headquarters employees, and one was opened to replace a closed location in Deerfield, IL. We do not expect to open any new stores in 2019.\nCharges associated with store closures are reported as appropriate in Asset impairments and Merger and restructuring expenses (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These charges are reflected in Corporate reporting and are not included in the determination of Division operating income. Refer to Corporate\u201d discussion below for additional information regarding expenses incurred to date.\nCOMPUCOM DIVISION\n\nThe CompuCom Division was formed at the time of acquisition on November 8, 2017 and the amounts reflect the operating results of CompuCom since that date. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The total sales increase in 2018 was primarily due to a full year of our CompuCom Division's operating results. Total sales in our CompuCom Division in 2018 were affected by lower business volume from one of its largest customers currently experiencing a significant reorganization. The CompuCom Division's operating income in 2018 was also affected by lower gross margin on product sales mix, and higher expenses associated with onboarding new customers and other growth initiatives.\nOTHER\n\nCertain operations previously included in the International Division, including our global sourcing and trading operations in the Asia/Pacific region, which we have retained, are presented as Other. These operations primarily relate to the sale of products to former joint venture partners, and are not material in any period. Also included in Other is the elimination of intersegment revenues of $11 million in 2018. There is no elimination of intersegment revenues reflected in the 2017 and 2016 amounts.\nTable of Content\nCORPORATE\nThe line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations impacted by Corporate activities are presented in the table below, followed by a narrative discussion of the significant matters. These activities are managed at the Corporate level and, accordingly, are not included in the determination of Division income for management reporting or external disclosures.\n\nIn addition to these charges and credits, certain Selling, general and administrative expenses are not allocated to the Divisions and are managed at the Corporate level. Those expenses are addressed in the section Unallocated Costs\u201d below.\nAsset impairments\nAsset impairment charges are comprised of the following:\n\nWe regularly conduct a detailed store impairment analysis including any favorable lease intangible assets related to each store. The analysis includes estimates of store-level sales, gross margins, direct expenses, exercise of future lease renewal options where applicable, and resulting cash flows and, by their nature, include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance. If the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying value of its assets, the assets are written down to estimated fair value.\nThe projections prepared for the 2018 analysis assumed declining sales over the forecast period. Gross margin and operating cost assumptions have been held at levels consistent with recent actual results and planned activities. The present value of our cash flows projections was determined using a 7% discount rate, which reflects a reduction in our cost of capital and balance sheet de-leverage in 2018. The", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to provide information to assist readers in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We recommend reading this MD&A in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in this Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company\nWe are a leading provider of business services and supplies, products and technology solutions through our fully integrated business-to-business ( B2B\u201d) distribution platform of 1,361 retail stores, online presence, and dedicated sales professionals and technicians to retail consumers and small, medium and enterprise businesses. Through our banner brands Office Depot\u00ae, OfficeMax\u00ae, CompuCom\u00ae and Grand&Toy\u00ae, we offer our customers the tools and resources they need to focus on their passion of starting, growing and running their business.\nAt December 29, 2018, our operations are organized into three reportable segments (or Divisions\u201d): Business Solutions Division, Retail Division and CompuCom Division.\nThe Business Solutions Division or BSD provides customers with office supply products and services in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Canada through dedicated sales forces, catalogs, telesales, and electronically through our Internet websites.\nThe Retail Division includes our chain of retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands where we sell office supplies, technology products and solutions, business machines and related supplies, print, cleaning, breakroom supplies and facilities products, and furniture. In addition, our Retail Division offers a range of business-related services targeted to small businesses, technology support services as well as printing, copying, mailing and shipping services.\nThe CompuCom Division was formed during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the acquisition of CompuCom Systems, Inc. ( CompuCom\u201d). The CompuCom Division provides information technology ( IT\u201d) outsourcing services and products to enterprise organizations in the United States and Canada, and offers a broad range of solutions including end user computing support, managed IT services, data center monitoring and management, service desk, network infrastructure, IT workforce solutions, mobile device management and cloud services.\nAcquisitions\nOver the last two years, we have been undergoing a strategic transformation to pivot Office Depot into an integrated B2B distribution platform, with the objective of expanding our product offerings to include value-added services for our customers and capture greater market share.\nAs part of this transformation, we acquired CompuCom in 2017 and an enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider in 2018. The latter gives us access to a platform for selling or providing Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) related hardware and projects to the education market. IoT refers to the connection of intelligent systems and devices to allow them to automatically share information so that systems and devices work intelligently together to develop and enhance solutions and reduce human intervention.\nTo strengthen our core operations, over the last two years we have also expanded the reach of our distribution network by identifying and acquiring profitable regional office supply distribution businesses serving small and mid-market customers in geographic areas that were previously underserved by our network. This has allowed, and will continue to allow, for an effective and accretive means to expand our distribution reach, target new business customers and grow our offerings beyond traditional office supplies.\nThe aggregate total purchase consideration, including contingent consideration, for the seven acquisitions completed in 2018 was approximately $114 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. The aggregate purchase price was primarily funded with cash on hand, with the remainder consisting of contingent consideration estimated to be $28 million, the majority of which will be paid in the first quarter of 2019.\nThe operating results of these companies are combined with our operating results subsequent to their purchase dates. The operating results of the office supply distribution businesses we acquired are included in the Business Solutions Division segment, whereas the operating results of CompuCom and the enterprise IT solutions integrator and managed services provider are included in the CompuCom Division. Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable of Content\nDisposition of the International Division - Discontinued Operations\nIn September 2016, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell substantially all of our international operations, formerly reported as the International Division through four disposal groups (Europe, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand ( Oceania\u201d) and mainland China).\nOn December 31, 2016, we completed the sale of our business in Europe (the European Business\u201d) to The AURELIUS Group (the Purchaser\u201d) and recorded a pre-tax loss on sale of $108 million in 2016. We recorded approximately $8 million of additional costs associated with the sale during 2017. We retained the assets and obligations of a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom.\nWe completed the sale of our business in South Korea on April 26, 2017, and recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $12 million. Additionally, we completed the sale of our business in mainland China on July 28, 2017, and recognized a cumulative loss of $9 million associated with the sale, of which $10 million was recognized in the first half of 2017 and was partially offset by a $1 million gain recognized at the time of sale. We retained the sourcing and trading operations of the former International Division, which are presented as Other in Note 5. Segment Information\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe completed the sale of our businesses in Australia on February 5, 2018, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $1 million. Additionally, we completed the sale of our business in New Zealand on May 4, 2018, and recognized a pre-tax loss on the sale of $3 million. With the sale of this last disposal group, the sale of the International Operations is complete, and there are no further discontinued operations at December 29, 2018.\nRefer to Note 18. Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOverview of 2018 Consolidated Results from Continuing Operations and Liquidity\nThe following summarizes the more significant factors impacting our operating results from continuing operations for the 52-week period ended December 29, 2018 (also referred to as 2018\u201d) and the 52-week period ended December 30, 2017 (also referred to as 2017\u201d) as well as our liquidity in 2018 and 2017.\nOur consolidated sales were 8% higher in 2018 compared to 2017 mostly as a result of including our CompuCom Division's sales for the full year in 2018. Our Business Solutions Division also contributed higher sales of $174 million, which represented an improvement from the prior year of 3% primarily from acquisitions. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower sales in our Retail Division, which decreased 6% year-over-year from lower comparable store sales and store closures.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Business Solutions Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail Division\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in comparable store sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CompuCom Division **\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ** We formed the CompuCom Division as a result of our acquisition of CompuCom on November 8, 2017. The 2017 amount represents sales from the acquisition date of November 8, 2017 through the end of fiscal 2017. \nTable of Content\nProduct sales remained flat in 2018 compared to 2017, while service revenues grew 84%. Higher service revenues were driven primarily by the acquisition of CompuCom. Service revenues in 2018 were also impacted by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, which negatively affected the comparability of service revenues by $57 million year-over-year. Refer to Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Excluding our CompuCom Division and the impact of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard, service revenues grew 13% as a result of our strategic efforts to expand the array of enterprise and consumer service offerings. The primary drivers of our year-over-year growth in service revenues, excluding the CompuCom acquisition, include higher demand for our managed print and fulfillment services, and the expansion of our service and product subscriptions, with more than one million new subscriptions in 2018 generating over $100 million in sales. On a consolidated basis, services represent approximately 15% and 9% of our total sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Significant Factors Impacting Total Company Results and Liquidity\n \u2022 Total gross profit increased by $90 million or 4% in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from lower sales in our retail stores. Total gross margin was approximately 80 basis points lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily attributable to store and supply chain deleverage. \n \u2022 Total selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $157 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase reflects $286 million associated with the acquired businesses, partially offset by $129 million related to retail stores closures, lower payroll expenses, operational efficiencies and synergies. As a percentage of sales, total selling, general and administrative expenses remained flat in 2018 when compared to 2017. \n \u2022 We recorded $72 million of Merger and restructuring expenses, net in 2018 compared to $94 million in 2017. Merger and restructuring expense in 2018 includes $46 million of severance, retention, transaction and integration costs associated with our acquisition of CompuCom and the other businesses, $10 million of expenses related to OfficeMax merger activities, which were completed in 2018, $11 million of expenses associated with our strategic transformation plan, and $5 million of expenses associated with our Comprehensive Business Review program. Refer to Note 3. Merger and Restructuring Activity\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 We recorded a $25 million legal expense accrual in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with certain settlement discussions we have undertaken with the Federal Trade Commission in the quarter. Refer to Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate of 37% in 2018 reflects the lowered Federal marginal tax rate of 21% as well as a mix of income and losses across US and non-US jurisdictions. In addition, our rate was impacted by several discrete items in the quarter including the impact of the potential nondeductible legal settlement and the impact of excess tax deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation awards, state taxes, and certain other nondeductible items. In addition, we completed several acquisitions and dispositions, some of which resulted in the recognition of a gain or loss for tax purposes that differed from the amount recognized for GAAP purposes. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was 51%, primarily impacted by the reduction in the statutory effective Federal rate from 35% to 21% which caused a non-cash charge of $68 million, partially offset by the reversal of $42 million of our U.S. federal and state valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as we concluded that it was more likely than not that a benefit from the related deferred tax assets would be realizable. \n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.18 in 2018 compared to $0.27 in 2017. \n \u2022 Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations was $0.01 in 2018 compared to $0.06 in 2017. \n \u2022 Including diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations, net diluted earnings per share was $0.19 in 2018 compared to $0.34 in 2017. As disclosed in Note 18 Discontinued Operations\u201d to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we completed the sale of our former International Operations in the first half of 2018. \nTable of Content\n \u2022 At December 29, 2018, we had $658 million in cash and cash equivalents and $947 million available under the Amended Credit Agreement. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $616 million for 2018 compared to $467 million for 2017. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of this Item 7 for more information on cash flows. \n \u2022 In 2017, we entered into a $750 million Term Loan Credit Agreement in connection with our acquisition of CompuCom. In November 2018, we executed the First Amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the First Amendment\u201d) to reduce the applicable interest rate from LIBOR plus 7.00% to LIBOR plus 5.25%. In connection with the applicable interest rate reduction, we made a voluntary repayment under the Term Loan Credit Agreement of $194 million. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized a $15 million loss on modification of debt, which is comprised of a 1% prepayment premium and the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount in an amount proportional to the term loan repaid. \n \u2022 During 2018 and 2017, we paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock of $0.025 per share for a total annual dividend distribution of $55 million and $53 million, respectively. In addition, under our share repurchase program we bought back approximately 14 million shares of our common stock in each of the last two fiscal years, returning another $39 million in 2018 and $56 million in 2017 to our shareholders. \nOPERATING RESULTS\nDiscussion of additional income and expense items, including material charges and credits and changes in interest and income taxes follows our review of segment results. Fiscal years 2018 and 2017 includes 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2016 includes 53 weeks, with a 14-week fourth quarter.\nBUSINESS SOLUTIONS DIVISION\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Division operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to 2018, we also reported changes in sales for our Business Solutions Division on a constant currency basis given the span of our former international operations. As disclosed in Note 18 Discontinued Operations\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, between the third quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2018, we sold substantially all of our international operations. As a result, over the last two years the Business Solutions Division's exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has been primarily limited to our Canadian operations, and the fluctuation of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar has had an immaterial impact to the changes in sales for the Division for all periods herein presented.\nProduct sales from our Business Solutions Division increased 3% in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily due to acquisitions, higher online sales and growth in adjacency categories, such as cleaning/breakroom supplies and furniture, partially offset by lower sales of other product categories including paper, toner and ink. Improved sales from the omni-channel programs that we report under our Retail Division partially offset the growth in product sales from our Business Solutions Division - see discussion on order online for pick up in stores or ship from stores within the Retail Division analysis. Product sales declined 6% from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to competitive pressures, customer losses in the contract sales channel, lower catalog sales through our call centers and the impact of increasing levels of sales from the omni-channel programs. The Business Solutions Division sales in 2017 were also affected by one less selling week compared to 2016, resulting in approximately $56 million of lower sales, and the impact of three powerful hurricanes that disrupted our retail and contract operations.\nSales of services in our Business Solutions Division increased 16% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 3% in 2017 compared to 2016. This positive trend is the reflection of increased sales of our managed print and fulfillment services, and the expansion of our product subscriptions for toner and software.\nTable of Content\nBusiness Solutions Division operating income declined 7% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 1% in 2017 compared to 2016. As a percentage of sales operating income declined 53 basis points in 2018 compared to 2017, and increased 22 basis points in 2017 compared to 2016. Higher selling, general and administrative expenses from investments in our eCommerce platform, demand generation activities and acquisitions costs impacted operating income in 2018. However, these expenses were partially offset by an increase in gross profit primarily from acquisitions. Operating income in our Business Solutions Division was also negatively impacted by the migration of legacy OfficeMax customers to our current systems, which was completed in 2018. The decrease in operating income in 2017 was largely the result of having one less reporting week compared to fiscal 2016.\nRETAIL DIVISION\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Division operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in comparable store sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts sales in our Retail Division decreased 7% and 11% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, compared to the corresponding prior-year periods. This was primarily the result of closing underperforming stores coupled with fewer transactions in the existing locations, a trend that we have partially offset by gradually increasing the volume of omni-channel transactions, whereby our Business Solutions Division customers order online for pick up in our stores. These transactions are included in our Retail Division's sales as they are fulfilled with store inventory and serviced by Retail Division employees.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Buy Online-Pickup in Store\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> % change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales of services within our Retail Division in 2018 were 1% higher compared to 2017. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, which requires that our third-party software sales be reported on a net basis, negatively affected the comparability of our sales of services by $53 million year-over-year. This change in presentation had no impact to the timing of recognition, gross profit, earnings or cash flows. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, sales of services in 2018 actually increased 11% from 2017 due to the expansion of our copy and print services, subscription services, and the introduction of new technology services offered to our retail customers by our store associates.\nIn 2017, sales of services decreased 15% compared to 2016 primarily because of store closures, lower store traffic and the business disruption associated with the three powerful hurricanes that occurred in the year.\nComparable store sales in 2018 decreased 4%, reflecting lower store traffic and transaction counts, partially offset by an increase in improved conversion rate and higher volume of omni-channel, online transactions for pick up in stores or ship from stores described above. Comparable store sales decreased across most of our primary product categories, including ink, supplies, computers and technology related products. Sales of paper and toner remained relatively flat year-over-year. On a comparable store sales basis, revenues related to our copy and print services increased 3% in 2018 when compared to 2017. The 5% comparable store sales decline in 2017 reflect lower store traffic, transaction counts and average order values, partially offset by an improved conversion rate, sales transfers from closed stores into stores that remained open and higher sales from the success of our omni-channel programs compared to 2016. Our comparable store sales relate to stores that have been open for at least one year. Stores are removed from the comparable sales calculation one month prior to closing, as sales during that period are largely non-comparable clearance activity. Stores are also removed from the comparable store sales calculation during periods of store remodeling, store closures due to hurricanes or natural disasters, or if significantly downsized. Our measure of comparable store sales has been applied consistently across periods but may differ from measures used by other companies.\nThe Retail Division operating income declined 24% in 2018 compared to 2017, and 15% from 2016 to 2017. This was mostly attributable to the flow-through impact of lower sales and gross margin rate, partially offset by lower dollars spent for selling, general, and administrative expenses, including payroll and other store expenses from both store closures and increased efficiency. The Division's operating income in 2018 also reflects the impact of investments in additional service capabilities, including targeted advertising, sales training and various customer-oriented initiatives. The impact of one less week in 2017 resulted in approximately $14 million of lower operating income for the Retail Division in 2017 compared to 2016. However, operating income as a percentage of sales remained relatively consistent year-over-year.\nTable of Content\nAt the end of 2018, the Retail Division operated 1,361 retail stores in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Refer to Note 2. Acquisitions\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The total sales increase in 2018 was primarily due to a full year of our CompuCom Division's operating results. Total sales in our CompuCom Division in 2018 were affected by lower business volume from one of its largest customers currently experiencing a significant reorganization. The CompuCom Division's operating income in 2018 was also affected by lower gross margin on product sales mix, and higher expenses associated with onboarding new customers and other growth initiatives.\nOTHER\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain operations previously included in the International Division, including our global sourcing and trading operations in the Asia/Pacific region, which we have retained, are presented as Other.

The analysis includes estimates of store-level sales, gross margins, direct expenses, exercise of future lease renewal options where applicable, and resulting cash flows and, by their nature, include judgments about how current initiatives will impact future performance. If the anticipated cash flows of a store cannot support the carrying value of its assets, the assets are written down to estimated fair value.\nThe projections prepared for the 2018 analysis assumed declining sales over the forecast period. Gross margin and operating cost assumptions have been held at levels consistent with recent actual results and planned activities. The present value of our cash flows projections was determined using a 7% discount rate, which reflects a reduction in our cost of capital and balance sheet de-leverage in 2018. The"}
