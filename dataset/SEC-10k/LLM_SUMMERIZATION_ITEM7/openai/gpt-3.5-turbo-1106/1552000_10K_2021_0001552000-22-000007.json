Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not address certain items regarding the year ended December 31, 2019. Discussion and analysis of 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAll statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. The following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nMPLX OVERVIEW\nWe are a diversified, large-cap MLP formed by MPC that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, and provides fuels distribution services. Our assets include a network of crude oil and refined product pipelines; an inland marine business; light-product, asphalt, heavy oil and marine terminals; storage caverns; refinery tanks, docks, loading racks, and associated piping; crude oil and natural gas gathering systems and pipelines; as well as natural gas and NGL processing and fractionation facilities. The business consists of two segments based on the nature of services it offers: Logistics and Storage ( L&S\u201d), and Gathering and Processing ( G&P\u201d). Our assets are positioned throughout the United States. The L&S segment is engaged in the gathering, transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. The L&S segment also includes the operation of our refining logistics, fuels distribution and inland marine businesses, terminals, rail facilities and storage caverns. The G&P segment provides gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; and the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs.\nSIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring 2021, we continued to make progress on our three critical priorities to lower our cost structure, improve our commercial performance and strengthen the competitive position of our assets while also benefiting from strong NGL commodity pricing and the recovery of refined product demand. Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021 are shown in the chart below. Refer to the Results of Operations and the Liquidity and Capital Resources sections for further details.\n(1) Includes impairment of equity method investments within our G&P operating segment of $6 million, $1,264 million and $42 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2) Includes impairment expense within our G&P operating segment of $42 million, $2,165 million and $1,197 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Plant, property and equipment were impaired in 2021, goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were impaired in 2020 and goodwill was impaired in 2019.\n(3) The 2019 amount includes Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Predecessor and DCF adjustments attributable to Predecessor.\nAdditional highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021 include:\n\u2022For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 we continued to see recovery in the environment in which our business operates. The increased availability of vaccinations and the reductions in travel and business restrictions appeared to drive increased economic activity, including the opening of many businesses and schools as well as more in-person interaction broadly. This drove 2021 improvements in our crude and refined product pipeline throughput levels to levels which exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels. While we have seen improved results through 2021, we are unable to predict the potential effects that further resurgences of COVID-19 may have on our financial position and results.\n\u2022In line with efforts around portfolio optimization, we closed on the sale of our Javelina plant in Corpus Christi, Texas, during the first quarter of 2021, for $70 million of cash in addition to future consideration contingent on\nthe performance of the facility. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we closed on the sale of minor gathering assets in Wyoming for proceeds of $41 million.\n\u2022Generated $4.9 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, $4.4 billion of free cash flow, and $1.4 billion of excess cash flow after capital spending and investments and base distributions paid to our common and preferred unitholders.\n\u2022With continued focus on strict capital discipline, we reduced our capital spending in 2021 with total growth capital of $509 million versus our initial capital plan of $800 million. The reduced spending was also driven by deferred producer-customer capital spending given the uncertainty related to COVID-19.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2021, we returned $630 million to unitholders through the repurchase of 22,907,174 public common units under our $1 billion unit repurchase program that was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, $337 million remained available under the program for future repurchases.\n\u2022Returned incremental capital to our common unitholders through the payment of a special distribution amount of $0.575 per common unit as well as a 2.5 percent increase in our normal quarterly distribution effective for the third quarter of 2021.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, free cash flow ( FCF\u201d) and excess/deficit cash flow. The amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF generated is considered by the board of directors of our general partner in approving MPLX's cash distributions.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) provision/(benefit) for income taxes; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs; (iv) extinguishment of debt; (v) non-cash equity-based compensation; (vi) impairment expense; (vii) net interest and other financial costs; (viii) income/(loss) from equity method investments; (ix) distributions and adjustments related to equity method investments; (x) unrealized derivative gains/(losses); (xi) acquisition costs; (xii) noncontrolling interests and (xiii) other adjustments as deemed necessary. We also use DCF, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for: (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) sales-type lease payments, net of income; (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) net maintenance capital expenditures; (v) equity method investment capital expenditures paid out; and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary. We make a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the realized gain or loss of the contract is recorded.\nWe define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for: (i) net cash used in investing activities; (ii) contributions from MPC; (iii) contributions from noncontrolling interests and (iv) distributions to noncontrolling interests. We define excess/deficit cash flow as FCF less base distributions to common and preferred unitholders.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, FCF and excess/deficit cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities while the GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF and excess/deficit cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities as they have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the Results of Operations section. For a reconciliation of FCF and excess/deficit cash flow to their most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\nManagement also utilizes Segment Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the financial performance of our segments. The disclosure of this measure allows investors to understand how management evaluates financial performance to make operating decisions and allocate resources.\nCOMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe comparability of our financial results has been impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, performance of our equity method investments, and impairments among others (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 4, 5 and 14).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table and discussion is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF from net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTable 21:

This was primarily due to lower volumes in the Southwest, Marcellus and Rockies, which includes impacts related to severe weather and the Javelina divestiture in the Southwest. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in fees due to a contract modification in the Marcellus resulting in a change in the presentation of lease income from rental income to service revenue.\nService revenue-related parties increased $48 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to increased revenue from pipelines and terminals of $251 million from higher throughput volumes. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $38 million due to a change in the presentation of lease income between service revenue, rental income and other income based on modifications of lease contracts, a $106 million decrease in marine transportation fees due to equipment rate adjustments resulting from the January 2021 contract renewal, and a $56 million decrease due to the transfer of the Western wholesale distribution business to MPC (the Wholesale Exchange\u201d) in 2020.\nRental income decreased $22 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to a contract modification in the Marcellus resulting in a change in the presentation of lease income from rental income to service revenue, partially offset by higher fees related to contracts in the Marcellus and Southern Appalachia.\nRental income-related parties decreased $209 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to a decrease of $240 million due to a change in the presentation of lease income between service revenue, rental income and sales-type lease revenue based on modification to lease contracts. The decrease was partially offset by increased terminal storage revenue as well as other miscellaneous increases.\nService revenue-product related, product sales and product sales-related parties increased $1,161 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to higher prices in all of the regions of approximately $1,102 million and other product related sales increases, partially offset by the impact related to the Javelina divestiture, impacts related to severe weather in the Southwest, a decrease in volumes in the Rockies and the Wholesale Exchange.\nSales-type lease revenue increased $283 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to a change in the presentation of lease income between service revenue, rental income and sales-type lease revenue due to modifications to lease contracts.\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments increased $1,257 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to the $1,264 million impairment charge recorded in 2020 for three of our equity affiliates.\nOther income and Other income-related parties increased $24 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to gains recognized on the sale of non-core assets.\nCost of revenues decreased $142 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to the Wholesale Exchange, lower operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the Javelina divestiture.\nPurchased product costs increased $1,046 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to higher prices of $859 million in the Southwest and Southern Appalachia, other product cost increases and an increase of $42 million due to unrealized derivative losses related to an embedded derivative in a natural gas purchase commitment.\nRental cost of sales and rental cost of sales-related parties decreased $50 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to modifications to lease contracts which resulted in costs now being recorded to purchases - related parties, as noted below, as opposed to rental cost of sales - related parties.\nPurchases-related parties increased $103 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to modifications to lease contracts which resulted in costs now being recorded to purchases - related parties as opposed to rental cost of sales - related parties. There were also increases due to higher prices in the Rockies, employee costs from MPC and project-related spend.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $90 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to the write-off of assets under construction and the impairment of refining logistics, pipeline and terminal assets in 2020, all related to assets located at idled MPC refineries as well as to the derecognition of fixed assets due to the modification of certain lease contracts in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by accelerated depreciation in the current year related to assets located at an indefinitely idled MPC refinery, as well as property, plant and equipment placed in service during 2021.\nImpairment expense decreased $2,123 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Due to changes in forecasted production growth resulting from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we recorded impairment expense of $1,814 million related to goodwill in the Eastern G&P reporting unit, $177 million and $174 million, related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the Southwest region.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $25 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to cost reduction initiatives.\nRestructuring expenses decreased $37 million in 2021 compared to 2020, due to cost-cutting measures during 2020.\nInterest expense and other financial costs (including related parties) decreased $17 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to lower interest expense due to repayment of senior notes during 2021, partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest due to lower 2021 project spend and an overall loss on debt extinguishments in 2021 compared to a gain on debt extinguishment in 2020.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nWe classify our business in the following reportable segments: L&S and G&P. Segment Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the reportable segments. Amounts included in net income and excluded from Segment Adjusted EBITDA include: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) provision/(benefit) for income taxes; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs; (iv) extinguishment of debt; (v) non-cash equity-based compensation; (vi) impairment expense; (vii) net interest and other financial costs; (viii) income/(loss) from equity method investments; (ix) distributions and adjustments related to equity method investments; (x) unrealized derivative gains/(losses); (xi) acquisition costs; (xii) noncontrolling interests; and (xiii) other adjustments as deemed necessary.

This was primarily due to increased volume from pipelines and terminals, partially offset by a $106 million decrease in marine transportation fees, a $56 million decrease due to the Wholesale Exchange, and a decrease of $38 million due to a change in the presentation of lease income between service revenue, rental income and sales-type lease revenue due to modifications to lease contracts.\nRental income decreased $213 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to a change in the presentation of lease income between service revenue, rental income and sales-type lease revenue due to modifications to lease contracts. The net decreases due to lease contract modifications were offset by increased terminal storage fees as well as higher refining logistics fees as a result of annual fee escalations.\nProduct related revenue decreased $37 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to the Wholesale Exchange.\nSales-type lease revenue increased $283 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to a change in the presentation of lease income between service revenue, rental income and sales-type lease revenue due to modifications to lease contracts.\nCost of revenues decreased $152 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to the Wholesale Exchange, lower project-related spend and other operating expenses as a result of cost reduction initiatives. In addition, modifications to lease contracts resulted in costs now being recorded to purchases - related parties, as noted below, as opposed to rental cost of sales - related parties, which is included in the decrease being explained here.\nPurchases - related parties increased $89 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to modifications to lease contracts which resulted in costs now being recorded to purchases - related parties as opposed to rental cost of sales - related parties, which is included in cost of revenues as noted above. In addition, higher employee related costs and project-related spend also contributed to the increase.\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $87 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to the write-off of assets under construction and the impairment of refining, pipeline and terminal assets in 2020, all related to assets located at idled MPC refineries, as well as to the derecognition of fixed assets due to the modification of certain lease contracts in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by accelerated depreciation in 2021 related to assets located at an indefinitely idled MPC refinery, as well as property, plant and equipment placed in service during 2021.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $23 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to decreased employee costs from MPC as a result of cost reduction initiatives.\nRestructuring expenses decreased $29 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was due to cost-cutting measures during 2020 that resulted in restructuring charges.\nG&P Segment\nG&P Segment Financial Highlights (in millions)\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue and other income(1)(2)\n</td> <td>Income/(loss) from operations (1)(3)\n</td> <td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes the results of Predecessor through July 30, 2019.\n(2) Includes impairment expense related to various equity method investments of $6 million, $1,264 million and $42 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(3) Includes impairment of property, plant and equipment of $42 million and equity method investments of $6 million for 2021, impairment of goodwill of $1,814 million, long-lived assets including intangibles of $351 million and equity method investments of $1,264 million for 2020 and impairment of goodwill of $1,197 million and equity method investments of $42 million for 2019.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(100) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income </td> <td>347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product related revenue </td> <td>2,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(129) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income/(loss) from equity method investments(1)\n</td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,090) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,180) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>70 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenues and other income </td> <td>4,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,405) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues </td> <td>799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>839 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchased product costs </td> <td>1,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(147) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchases -

During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the realized gain or loss of the contract is recorded.\n(3)See the Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to MPLX LP and DCF attributable to GP and LP unitholders from Net income table for the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(4)Capital expenditures do not include adjustments for asset retirement expenditures.\n2021 Compared to 2020\nService revenue decreased $65 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to lower fees from lower volumes in the Southwest, Marcellus and Rockies of $97 million, which includes impacts related to severe weather and the Javelina divestiture in the Southwest, partially offset by an increase in fees in the Marcellus due to a contract modification that resulted in a change in the presentation of revenue from rental income to service revenue.\nRental income decreased $18 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to a contract modification in the Marcellus resulting in a change in the presentation of revenue from rental income to service revenue, partially offset by higher fees related to contracts in the Marcellus and Southern Appalachia.\nProduct related revenue increased $1,198 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to higher prices in all of the regions of approximately $1,102 million and other product related sales increases, partially offset by lower volumes due to the Javelina divestiture, impacts related to severe weather in the Southwest and a decline in volumes in the Rockies.\nIncome (loss) from equity method investments increased $1,258 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This increase was driven by impairments recorded in the first quarter of 2020 of $1,264 million due to changes in forecasted production growth resulting from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the increase was higher volumes associated with our Sherwood Midstream LLC and Ohio Condensate Company joint ventures. These increases were partially offset by lower volumes at our joint ventures in the Utica and Southwest regions along with an asset impairment recognized within our Three Rivers Gathering LLC joint venture in the current period.\nOther income increased $17 million in 2021 compared to 2020, this variance was primarily due to a gain recognized on asset sales.\nCost of revenues decreased $40 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower project-related spend and a decrease in other operating expenses, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by higher prices in the Rockies.\nPurchased product costs increased $1,046 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to higher prices of $859 million in the Southwest and Southern Appalachia, an increase of $42 million due to unrealized derivative losses related to an embedded derivative in a natural gas purchase commitment and other product cost increases.\nPurchases - related parties increased $14 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was primarily due to higher prices in the Rockies.\nImpairment expense decreased $2,123 million in 2021 compared to 2020. As a result of changes in forecasted production growth resulting from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020 we recorded impairment expense of $1,814 million related to goodwill in the Eastern G&P reporting unit, $177 million and $174 million, related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the Southwest region. This decrease was partially offset by an impairment recorded during 2021 related to the divestiture of several non-core assets and the closure of other non-core assets.\nRestructuring expenses decreased $8 million in 2021 compared to 2020. This was due to cost-cutting measures during 2020 that resulted in restructuring charges.\nOperating Data\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The primary reasons for the increase in the use of cash was due to the return of capital to unitholders through the unit repurchase program and the special distribution paid during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nFree Cash Flow - For the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated excess cash flow after capital investments and base distributions, allowing us to return capital to our unitholders through the repurchase $630 million of public common units during 2021 and a special distribution amount of $603 million during the fourth quarter of 2021.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, this amount includes distributions to common unitholders and Series B unitholders attributable to the Predecessor.\nDebt and Liquidity Overview\nCredit Agreement\nMPLX has a revolving credit facility (the MPLX Credit Agreement\u201d) with a borrowing capacity of $3.5 billion that matures in July 2024. Borrowings under the MPLX Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Adjusted LIBOR or the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement), at our election, plus a specified margin. We are charged various fees and expenses in connection with the agreement, including administrative agent fees, commitment fees on the unused portion of the bank revolving credit facility and fees with respect to issued and outstanding letters of credit. The applicable margins to the benchmark interest rates and certain fees fluctuate based on the credit ratings in effect from time to time on MPLX's long-term debt.\nThe MPLX Credit Agreement includes letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $300 million and swingline capacity of up to $150 million. The borrowing capacity under the MPLX Credit Agreement may be increased by up to an additional $1.0 billion, subject to certain conditions, including the consent of lenders whose commitments would increase. In addition, the maturity date may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods subject to, among other conditions, the approval of lenders holding the majority of the commitments then outstanding, provided that the commitments of any non-consenting lenders will terminate on the then-effective maturity date. During 2021, we borrowed $4,175 million under the MPLX Credit Agreement, at an average interest rate of 1.343 percent, and repaid $4,050 million of these borrowings. At December 31, 2021, MPLX had $300 million outstanding borrowings under the facility and less than $1.0 million in letters of credit outstanding, resulting in total availability of approximately $3,200 million, or approximately 91 percent of the borrowing capacity.\nThe MPLX Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for an agreement of that type that could, among other things, limit our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders. The financial covenant requires us to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict us and/or certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on our assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with this financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.7 to 1.0, as well as all other covenants contained in the MPLX Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes\nOn January 15, 2021, MPLX redeemed all of the $750 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.250 percent senior notes due January 15, 2025, including approximately $42 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by ANDX, at a price equal to 102.625 percent of the principal amount. The payment of $20 million related to the note premium, offset by the immediate expense recognition of $12 million of unamortized debt premium and issuance costs, resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $8 million that is included on the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other financial costs.\u201d\nOn September 3, 2021, MPLX redeemed, at par value, all of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due September 2022, which resulted in the immediate expense recognition of $2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. These costs are included on the Consolidated Statements of Income as Other financial costs.\u201d This redemption was funded primarily by borrowings under the MPC Loan Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $18.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding. The decrease compared to year-end 2020 resulted from the redemption of all of the $750 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.250 percent senior notes due January 15, 2025 and all of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due September 2022, as discussed above.\nMPC Loan Agreement\nMPLX is party to a loan agreement with MPC (the MPC Loan Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the MPC Loan Agreement, MPC extends loans to MPLX on a revolving basis as requested by MPLX and as agreed to by MPC. The borrowing capacity of the MPC Loan Agreement is $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of all loans outstanding at any one time. The MPC Loan Agreement is scheduled to expire, and borrowings under the MPC\nLoan Agreement are scheduled to mature and become due and payable on July 31, 2024, provided that MPC may demand payment of all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the loan, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts (if any), at any time prior to the maturity date. Borrowings under the MPC Loan Agreement bear interest at the one-month LIBOR plus 1.25 percent or such lower rate as would be applicable to such loans under the MPLX Credit Agreement. Activity on the MPC Loan Agreement for 2021 was as follows:\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except %) </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average interest rate of borrowings </td> <td>1.341 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,043 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Outstanding balance at end of period </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,450 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further discussion, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 and Note 17.\nOur intention is to maintain an investment grade credit profile. As of February 1, 2022, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were at or above investment grade level as follows:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Agency </td> <td> </td> <td>Rating </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's </td> <td> </td> <td>Baa2 (stable outlook) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB (stable outlook) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB (stable outlook) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe ratings shown above reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.\nThe agreements governing our debt obligations do not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades in the credit ratings of our senior unsecured debt ratings could, among other things, increase the applicable interest rates and other fees payable under the MPLX Credit Agreement, which may limit our flexibility to obtain future financing.\nOur liquidity totaled $3.26 billion at December 31, 2021, consisting of:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>Total Capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>Outstanding Borrowings </td> <td> </td> <td>Available\nCapacity </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPLX Credit Agreement </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MPC Loan Agreement </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,450) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,750) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and access to capital markets. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short-term and long-term funding requirements, including working capital requirements, capital expenditure requirements, contractual obligations and quarterly cash distributions. Our material future obligations include interest on debt, payments of debt principal, purchase obligations including contracts to acquire PP&E and our operating leases and service agreements. We may also, from time to time repurchase our senior notes and preferred units in the open market, in tender offers, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate and execute unit repurchases under our unit repurchase program\nMPC manages our cash and cash equivalents on our behalf directly with third-party institutions as part of the treasury services that it provides to us. From time to time, we may also consider utilizing other sources of liquidity, including the formation of joint ventures or sales of non-strategic assets.\nEquity and Preferred Units Overview\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the number of units outstanding through December 31, 2021:\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In units) </td> <td>Total Common Units </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2019 </td> <td>1,058,355,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unit-based compensation awards </td> <td>478,438 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units redeemed in unit repurchase program </td> <td>(1,473,843) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale Exchange </td> <td>(18,582,088) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2020 </td> <td>1,038,777,978 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unit-based compensation awards </td> <td>214,466 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units redeemed in unit repurchase program </td> <td>(22,907,174) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conversion of Series A preferred units </td> <td>93,108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2021 </td> <td>1,016,178,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor more details on equity activity, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 7 and 9.\nPreferred Units\nSeries A Preferred Units - On May 13, 2016, MPLX completed the private placement of approximately 30.8 million Series A preferred units for a cash purchase price of $32.50 per unit. The aggregate net proceeds of approximately $984 million from the sale of the preferred units were used for capital expenditures, repayment of debt and general business purposes.\nThe Series A preferred units rank senior to all common units with respect to distributions and rights upon liquidation. The holders of the Series A preferred units received cumulative quarterly distributions equal to $0.528125 per unit for each quarter prior to the second quarter of 2018. Beginning with the second quarter of 2018, the holders of the Series A preferred units are entitled to receive a quarterly distribution equal to the greater of $0.528125 per unit or the amount of distributions they would have received on an as converted basis. Distributions paid to Series A preferred unitholders during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $100 million, $81 million and $81 million, respectively. The distribution for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a Special Distribution Amount of $18 million, or $0.5750 per unit.\nIn December 2021, certain holders exercised their right to convert a total of 0.1 million Series A preferred units into common units. Approximately 29.5 million Series A preferred units remain outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nSeries B Preferred Units - Prior to MPLX's acquisition of Andeavor Logistics LP ( ANDX\u201d and such acquisition, the Merger\u201d), ANDX issued 600,000 units of 6.875 percent Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units representing limited partner interests of ANDX at a price to the public of $1,000 per unit. Upon completion of the Merger, the ANDX preferred units converted to preferred units of MPLX representing substantially equivalent limited partnership interests in MPLX. The Series B preferred units are pari passu with the Series A preferred units with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation.\nMPLX has the right to redeem some or all of the Series B preferred units, at any time, on or after February 15, 2023. MPLX will pay unitholders the Series B preferred unit redemption price of $1,000 per unit plus any accumulated and unpaid distributions up to the redemption date.\nDistributions on the Series B preferred units are payable semi-annually through February 15, 2023, and quarterly thereafter. Distributions paid to Series B preferred unitholders during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $41 million, $41 million and $21 million, respectively.\nUnit Repurchase Program\nOn November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the board authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of MPLX's outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases depends upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be suspended, discontinued, or restarted at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. The following table summarizes activity executed on the unit repurchase program during the years ended 2021 and 2020:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Units repurchased </td> <td>22,907,174 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,473,843 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Value of units repurchased, in millions (including commission costs) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average cost per unit </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.52 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2021, $337 million remained outstanding under the program for future repurchases.\nDistributions\nWe intend to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit, which equates to $267 million per quarter, or $1,067 million per year, based on the number of common units outstanding. On January 25, 2022, we announced that the board of directors of our general partner had declared a distribution of $0.7050 per common unit, which was paid on February 14, 2022 to common unitholders of record on February 4, 2022. This represents a 2.5 percent increase over the fourth quarter 2020 distribution. Although our Partnership Agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash each quarter, we do not otherwise have a legal obligation to distribute any particular amount per common unit.\nThe allocation of total quarterly cash distributions to limited and preferred partners is as follows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our distributions are declared subsequent to quarter end; therefore, the following table represents total cash distributions applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned.

Due to the timing of the closing, distributions presented in the table above include second quarter 2019 distributions on MPLX common units issued to former ANDX unitholders in connection with the Merger. MPC waived $12.5 million in quarterly distributions under the terms of ANDX's historical partnership agreement, which was instituted in 2017 and was to remain in effect through 2019, the original term of the waiver agreement. As such, the distributions on common units exclude $12.5 million of waived distributions for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and $37.5 million of waived distributions for the year ended December 31, 2019. Also included in the table above is $21 million of distributions on the Series B preferred units subsequent to the Merger as well as $21 million of distributions on the Series B units prior to the Merger and declared and paid by MPLX during the third quarter of 2019.\n(2) Includes the Special Distribution Amount of $0.5750 per unit and base distribution amount of $0.7050 per unit for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur operations are capital intensive, requiring investments to expand, upgrade, enhance or maintain existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, growth capital expenditures are those incurred for acquisitions or capital improvements that we expect will increase our operating capacity for volumes gathered, processed, transported or fractionated, decrease operating expenses within our facilities or increase operating income over the long term. Examples of growth capital expenditures include costs to develop or acquire additional pipeline, terminal, processing or storage capacity. In general, growth capital includes costs that are expected to generate additional or new cash flow for MPLX.\nOur capital expenditures for the past three years are shown in the table below:\nTable

Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n(3) Contributions from noncontrolling interests are shown as separate line within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n(4) Growth and maintenance capital reimbursements are included in the Contributions from MPC line within financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor 2022, we announced a capital outlook of $900 million which includes growth capital of $700 million, maintenance capital of $140 million and a $60 million investment in unconsolidated affiliates for the repayment of our 9.19 percent indirect share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture's debt due in 2022.\nOur growth capital plans are focused on investments in high-return projects to expand and debottleneck our existing assets. The L&S growth capital is directed towards logistics projects in support of MPC's Martinez Renewable Fuels project, projects in the Permian and Bakken basins and investments in the Permian basin supporting the BANGL and Whistler pipelines. These long-haul NGL and natural gas logistics systems transport product to the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nThe G&P segment growth capital is directed towards the addition of approximately 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Delaware basin in the Permian to meet increasing producer customer demand and 68 mbpd of de-ethanization capacity in the Marcellus to meet increased in-basin demand, both of which are expected to be completed in the second half of 2022, as well as gathering projects in the basins in which we operate. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant.\nCash Commitments\nThe Company's material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and other cash commitments as of December 31, 2021.\nOur contractual obligations primarily consist of outstanding borrowings on debt, commitment and administrative fees and interest. Additional information for third-party debt is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6 for additional information for related party loans. Our cash commitment at December 31, 2021 was $30,847 million.\nOur contractual commitment for co-location services agreements was $2,830 million at December 31, 2021. These agreements obligate us to pay MPC for operational and other services provided to the subsidiaries of MPLX Refining Logistics LLC.\nFinance and operating leases relate primarily to facilities and equipment under lease, including ground leases, building space, office and field equipment, storage facilities and transportation equipment. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 20 for further discussion about our lease obligations. Our cash commitment at December 31, 2021 was $975 million.\nTransportation and terminalling agreements that obligate us to minimum volume, throughput or payment commitments over the remaining terms of the agreements, have terms that range from one to 10 years. We expect to pass any minimum payment commitments through to producer customers. Minimum fees due under transportation agreements do not include potential fee increases as required by FERC. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21 for further discussion. Our cash commitment at December 31, 2021 was $963 million.\nWe have commitments under contracts to acquire property, plant and equipment, for which additional information is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 21. Our cash commitment at December 31, 2021 was $116 million. These commitments were primarily related to G&P plant expansions.\nNatural gas purchase obligations consist primarily of a purchase agreement with a producer in our Southern Appalachia Operations. The contract provides for the purchase of keep-whole volumes at a specific price and is a component of a broader regional arrangement. The contract price is designed to share a portion of the frac spread with the producer and as a result, the amounts reflected for the obligation exceed the cost of purchasing the keep-whole volumes at a market price. The contract is considered an embedded derivative (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16 for the fair value of the frac spread sharing component). We use the estimated future frac spreads as of December 31, 2021 for calculating this obligation. The counterparty to the contract has the option to renew the gas purchase agreement and the related keep-whole processing agreement after 2027. Our cash commitment, not including this renewal option, at December 31, 2021 was $66 million.\nOur other cash commitments consist of expense projects, right of way and easement obligations and ARO commitments. Our cash commitment at December 31, 2021 was $219 million.\nIn addition, we have omnibus agreements and employee agreements with MPC. One of the omnibus agreements with MPC addresses our payment of a fixed annual fee to MPC for the provision of executive management services by certain executive officers of our general partner and our reimbursement to MPC for the provision of certain general and administrative services to us.\nWe also pay MPC additional amounts based on the costs actually incurred by MPC in providing other services, except for the portion of the amount attributable to engineering services, which is based on the amounts actually incurred by MPC and its affiliates plus six percent of such costs. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse MPC for most out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by MPC on our behalf.\nMPLX has various employee agreements with MPC under which MPLX reimburses MPC for employee benefit expenses, along with the provision of operational and management services in support of both our L&S and G&P segments' operations.\nWe incurred $1,614 million of costs under various agreements, including the omnibus and employee agreements for 2021.\nEffects of Inflation\nInflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. However, inflation is a growing concern in the United States economy and may increase the cost to acquire, build or replace property, plant and equipment. It may also significantly increase the costs of labor and supplies. To the extent permitted by competition, regulation and our existing agreements, we have and expect to continue to pass along a portion of increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees.\nTRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nAs of December 31, 2021, MPC owned our general partner and an approximate 64 percent limited partner interest in us. We perform a variety of services for MPC related to the transportation of crude and refined petroleum products via pipeline, truck or marine as well as terminal services, storage services and fuels distribution and marketing services, among others. The services that we provide may be based on regulated tariff rates or on contracted rates. In addition, MPC performs certain services for us related to information technology, engineering, legal, accounting, treasury, human resources and other administrative services. For further discussion of agreements and activity with MPC and related parties see Item 1. Business and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6.\nExcluding losses for impairment of equity method investments, MPC accounted for 50 percent, 55 percent and 53 percent of our total revenues and other income for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of our total costs and expenses, excluding impairment expense, MPC accounted for 26 percent, 30 percent and 30 percent for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to remediate environmental damage from any discharge of hazardous, petroleum or chemical substances from our facilities or require us to install additional pollution control equipment on our equipment and facilities. Our failure to comply with these or any other environmental or safety-related regulations could result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial liabilities, and the issuance of injunctions that may subject us to additional operational constraints.\nFuture expenditures may be required to comply with the CAA and other federal, state and local requirements for our various facilities. The impact of these legislative and regulatory developments, if enacted or adopted, could result in increased compliance costs and additional operating restrictions on our business, each of which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. MPC will indemnify us for certain of these costs.\nIf these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the fees and tariff rates we receive for our services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary\ndepending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the age and location of its operating facilities. Our environmental expenditures for each of the past three years were:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except %) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compliance: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remediation(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, and exclude non-cash accruals for environmental remediation.\nWe accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.\nNew or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. We believe we comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment, but since not all of them are fixed or presently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.\nOur environmental capital expenditures are expected to approximate $14 million in 2022. Actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (i) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (ii) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.\nThe policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for additional information on these policies and estimates, as well as a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates.\nFair Value Estimates\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.\nThe fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and do not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n\u2022Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\u2022Level 2 - Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.\n\u2022Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management's best estimate of fair value.\nValuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.\nSignificant uses of fair value measurements include:\n\u2022assessment of impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments;\n\u2022assessment of values for assets in implicit leases;\n\u2022recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and\n\u2022recorded values of derivative instruments.\nImpairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments\nFair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include:\n\u2022Future Operating Performance. Our estimates of future operating performance are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions as well as commodity prices. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.\n\u2022Future volumes. Our estimates of future throughput of crude oil, natural gas, NGL and refined product volumes are based on internal forecasts and depend, in part, on assumptions about our customers' drilling activity which is inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors (including future or expected pricing considerations), many of which are difficult to forecast. Management considers these volume forecasts and other factors when developing our forecasted cash flows.\n\u2022Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.\n\u2022Future capital requirements. These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.\nAssumptions about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the macroeconomic environment, which is difficult to forecast. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections.\nThe need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for commodities, a poor outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or NGL volumes processed, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which the asset or equity method investment is located.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment Assessments\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which is at least at the segment level and in some cases for similar assets in the same geographic region where cash flows can be separately identified. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down if greater than the calculated fair value.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nUnlike long-lived assets, goodwill must be tested for impairment at least annually, and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. We have five reporting units, three of which have goodwill allocated to them. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2021, MPLX had three reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately $7.7 billion, which includes goodwill associated with our Crude Gathering reporting unit of $1.1 billion. For the annual impairment assessment as of November 30, 2021, management performed only a qualitative assessment for one reporting unit as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. A quantitative assessment was last performed on this reporting unit at March 31, 2020 which indicated fair value exceeded carrying value by approximately 270 percent. A quantitative assessment was performed for the remaining two reporting units, which resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by 23 percent and 51 percent. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimates of the fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management's best estimates of the discount rate of 7.2 percent as well as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customers' development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements. An increase of one percentage to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of November 30, 2021.\nSignificant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units' fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14 for additional information relating to our reporting units and goodwill.\nEquity Method Investment Impairment Assessments\nEquity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee's inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. At December 31, 2021, we had $3,981 million of equity method investments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAn estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed adjustments may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 for additional information on our equity method investments and Note 14 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles.\nLeases\nIn accounting for leases, MPLX may be required to analyze new or existing leases for lease classification. One of the key inputs into the lease classification analysis is the fair value of the leased assets. Significant assumptions used to estimate the leased assets' fair value included market information for comparable assets and cost estimates to replace the service capacity of an asset.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a VIE. Our interests in a VIE are referred to as variable interests. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE's assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in a VIE, we must determine if we are the entity's primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated.\nSignificant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity's need for continuing financial support; the equity holder's lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder's voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions.\nChanges in the design or nature of the activities of a VIE, or our involvement with a VIE, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity's status as a VIE and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. Such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. This could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements.\nVIEs are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe accrue contingent liabilities for legal actions, claims, litigation, environmental remediation, tax deficiencies related to operating taxes and third-party indemnities for specified tax matters when such contingencies are both probable and estimable. We regularly assess these estimates in consultation with legal counsel to consider resolved and new matters, material developments in court proceedings or settlement discussions, new information obtained as a result of ongoing discovery and past experience in defending and settling similar matters. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. For instance, settlement costs for claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on degree of responsibility and assessments of the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation may vary from estimates because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination and improvements in technology.\nWe generally record losses related to these types of contingencies as cost of revenues or selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income, except for tax deficiencies unrelated to income taxes, which are recorded as other taxes.\nAn estimate of the sensitivity to net income if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions\nand the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, in terms of both the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss.\nFor additional information on contingent liabilities, see Item 7.

Our assets include a network of crude oil and refined product pipelines; an inland marine business; light-product, asphalt, heavy oil and marine terminals; storage caverns; refinery tanks, docks, loading racks, and associated piping; crude oil and natural gas gathering systems and pipelines; as well as natural gas and NGL processing and fractionation facilities. The business consists of two segments based on the nature of services it offers: Logistics and Storage ( L&S\u201d), and Gathering and Processing ( G&P\u201d). Our assets are positioned throughout the United States. The L&S segment is engaged in the gathering, transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. The L&S segment also includes the operation of our refining logistics, fuels distribution and inland marine businesses, terminals, rail facilities and storage caverns. The G&P segment provides gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; and the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs.\nSIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring 2021, we continued to make progress on our three critical priorities to lower our cost structure, improve our commercial performance and strengthen the competitive position of our assets while also benefiting from strong NGL commodity pricing and the recovery of refined product demand. Significant financial and other highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021 are shown in the chart below. Refer to the Results of Operations and the Liquidity and Capital Resources sections for further details.\n(1) Includes impairment of equity method investments within our G&P operating segment of $6 million, $1,264 million and $42 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2) Includes impairment expense within our G&P operating segment of $42 million, $2,165 million and $1,197 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Plant, property and equipment were impaired in 2021, goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were impaired in 2020 and goodwill was impaired in 2019.\n(3) The 2019 amount includes Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Predecessor and DCF adjustments attributable to Predecessor.\nAdditional highlights for the year ended December 31, 2021 include:\n\u2022For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 we continued to see recovery in the environment in which our business operates. The increased availability of vaccinations and the reductions in travel and business restrictions appeared to drive increased economic activity, including the opening of many businesses and schools as well as more in-person interaction broadly. This drove 2021 improvements in our crude and refined product pipeline throughput levels to levels which exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels. While we have seen improved results through 2021, we are unable to predict the potential effects that further resurgences of COVID-19 may have on our financial position and results.\n\u2022In line with efforts around portfolio optimization, we closed on the sale of our Javelina plant in Corpus Christi, Texas, during the first quarter of 2021, for $70 million of cash in addition to future consideration contingent on\nthe performance of the facility. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we closed on the sale of minor gathering assets in Wyoming for proceeds of $41 million.\n\u2022Generated $4.9 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, $4.4 billion of free cash flow, and $1.4 billion of excess cash flow after capital spending and investments and base distributions paid to our common and preferred unitholders.\n\u2022With continued focus on strict capital discipline, we reduced our capital spending in 2021 with total growth capital of $509 million versus our initial capital plan of $800 million. The reduced spending was also driven by deferred producer-customer capital spending given the uncertainty related to COVID-19.\n\u2022During the year ended December 31, 2021, we returned $630 million to unitholders through the repurchase of 22,907,174 public common units under our $1 billion unit repurchase program that was launched in the fourth quarter of 2020. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, $337 million remained available under the program for future repurchases.\n\u2022Returned incremental capital to our common unitholders through the payment of a special distribution amount of $0.575 per common unit as well as a 2.5 percent increase in our normal quarterly distribution effective for the third quarter of 2021.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, free cash flow ( FCF\u201d) and excess/deficit cash flow. The amount of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF generated is considered by the board of directors of our general partner in approving MPLX's cash distributions.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) provision/(benefit) for income taxes; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs; (iv) extinguishment of debt; (v) non-cash equity-based compensation; (vi) impairment expense; (vii) net interest and other financial costs; (viii) income/(loss) from equity method investments; (ix) distributions and adjustments related to equity method investments; (x) unrealized derivative gains/(losses); (xi) acquisition costs; (xii) noncontrolling interests and (xiii) other adjustments as deemed necessary. We also use DCF, which we define as Adjusted EBITDA adjusted for: (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) sales-type lease payments, net of income; (iii) net interest and other financial costs; (iv) net maintenance capital expenditures; (v) equity method investment capital expenditures paid out; and (vi) other adjustments as deemed necessary. We make a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the realized gain or loss of the contract is recorded.\nWe define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for: (i) net cash used in investing activities; (ii) contributions from MPC; (iii) contributions from noncontrolling interests and (iv) distributions to noncontrolling interests. We define excess/deficit cash flow as FCF less base distributions to common and preferred unitholders.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, DCF, FCF and excess/deficit cash flow provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities while the GAAP measure most directly comparable to FCF and excess/deficit cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities as they have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because non-GAAP financial measures may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF to their most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the Results of Operations section. For a reconciliation of FCF and excess/deficit cash flow to their most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.\nManagement also utilizes Segment Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating the financial performance of our segments. The disclosure of this measure allows investors to understand how management evaluates financial performance to make operating decisions and allocate resources.\nCOMPARABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe comparability of our financial results has been impacted by acquisitions, dispositions, performance of our equity method investments, and impairments among others (see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes 4, 5 and 14).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table and discussion is a summary of our results of operations for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, including a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF from net income and net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\n(1)Includes impairment expense related to various equity method investments of $6 million, $1,264 million and $42 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)Non-GAAP measure. See reconciliation below for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n\n(1)Includes impairment expense related to various equity method investments of $6 million, $1,264 million and $42 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2) MPLX makes a distinction between realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss is reversed and the realized gain or loss of the contract is recorded.\n(3) The Adjusted EBITDA and DCF adjustments related to Predecessor are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA attributable to MPLX LP and DCF attributable to GP and LP unitholders prior to the acquisition dates.\n(4) Includes impact from refining logistics harmonization project of $54 million.\n(5) Includes MPLX distributions declared on the Series A preferred units, Series B preferred units and TexNew Mex units, as well as cash distributions earned by the Series B preferred units (as the Series B preferred units are declared and payable semi-annually), assuming a distribution is declared by the Board of Directors. Cash distributions declared/to be paid to holders of the Series A preferred units, Series B preferred units and TexNew Mex units are not available to common unitholders. The TexNew Mex units were eliminated effective February\n1, 2021. The distributions to Series A preferred unitholders for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 include the Special Distribution Amount of $0.575 per unit, or a total of $18 million in addition to the base distributions.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.
