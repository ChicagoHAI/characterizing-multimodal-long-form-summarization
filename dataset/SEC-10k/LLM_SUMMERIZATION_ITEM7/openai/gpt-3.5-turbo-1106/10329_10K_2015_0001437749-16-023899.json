MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data)\nOverview\nBassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings ( BHF\u201d) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers, specialty stores and mass merchants. We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 113-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything that we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy.\nWith 93 BHF stores at November 28, 2015, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories. We created our store program in 1997 to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service. The store features custom order furniture ready for delivery in less than 30 days, more than 1,000 upholstery fabrics, free in-home design visits, and coordinated decorating accessories. We believe that our capabilities in custom upholstery have become unmatched in recent years. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its delivery. The selling philosophy in the stores is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer. Sales people are referred to as Design Consultants and are each trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor. We continue to strengthen the sales and design talent within our Company-owned retail stores. Our Design Consultants undergo extensive Design Certification training. This training has strengthened their skills related to our house call and design business, and is intended to increase business with our most valuable customers.\nIn order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers, specialty stores and mass merchants. We use a network of over 25 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.\nFor many years we owned 49% of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC ( Zenith\u201d). During that time the strategic significance of our partnership with Zenith had risen to include the over-the-road transportation of furniture, the operation of regional freight terminal, warehouse and distribution facilities in eleven states, and the management of various home delivery facilities that service Bassett Home Furnishings stores and other clients in local markets around the United States. On February 2, 2015, we acquired the remaining 51% of Zenith, which now operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bassett. Our acquisition of Zenith brings to our Company the ability to deliver best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of the furniture industry, as well as the ability to provide the expedited delivery service which is increasingly demanded by our industry. We believe that our ownership of Zenith will not only enhance our own wholesale and retail distribution capabilities, but will provide additional growth opportunities as Zenith continues to expand its service to other customers.\nIn September of 2011, we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with HGTV (Home and Garden Television), a division of Scripps Networks, LLC, which combines our heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of 96 million households in the United States that HGTV enjoys today. As part of this alliance, the in-store design centers have been co-branded with HGTV to more forcefully market the concept of a home makeover\u201d, an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the HGTV network. We believe the new co-branded design centers coupled with the targeted national advertising on HGTV have played a key role in our improved comparable store sales since their introduction. In October of 2015, we announced the extension of our partnership with HGTV through 2019. While continuing to feature HGTV branded custom upholstery products in our HGTV HOME Design Studios in Bassett Home Furnishings stores, we will now expand the concept to select independent dealers. We believe this will provide additional growth outside our BHF store network.\nAt November 28, 2015, our BFH store network included 60 Company-owned stores and 33 licensee-owned stores. Due to the improved operating performance of our retail network along with continued improvement in underlying economic factors such as the housing market and consumer confidence, we have been expanding our retail presence in various parts of the country. As part of this expansion we opened one new store and relocated two stores during fiscal 2015 while opening six new stores and relocating two stores in fiscal 2014. We plan to continue opening new stores, primarily in underpenetrated markets where we currently have stores. In this regard we are currently considering several locations for new store expansion over the next three years, with at least three of these planned to open in fiscal 2016. We continue to evaluate all stores in our fleet and plan to close three underperforming stores this year as well.\nAs with any retail operation, prior to opening a new store we incur such expenses as rent, training costs and other payroll related costs. These costs generally range between $100 to $300 per store depending on the overall rent costs for the location and the period between the time when we take physical possession of the store space and the time of the store opening. Generally, rent payments during a buildout period between delivery of possession and opening of a new store are deferred and therefore straight line rent expense recognized during that time does not require cash. Inherent in our retail business model, we also incur losses in the two to three months of operation following a new store opening. Like other furniture retailers, we do not recognize a sale until the furniture is delivered to our customer. Because our retail business model does not involve maintaining a stock of retail inventory that would result in quick delivery and because of the custom nature of many of our furniture offerings, delivery to our customers usually occurs about 30 days after an order is placed. We generally require a deposit at the time of order and collect the remaining balance when the furniture is delivered, at which time the sale is recognized. Coupled with the previously discussed store pre-opening costs, total start-up losses can range from $300 to $500 per store. While our retail expansion is initially costly, we believe our site selection and new store presentation will generally result in locations that operate at or above a retail break-even level within a reasonable period of time following store opening. Factors affecting the length of time required to achieve this goal on a store-by-store basis may include the level of brand recognition, the degree of local competition and the depth of penetration in a particular market. Even as new stores ramp up to break-even, we do realize additional wholesale sales volume that leverages the fixed costs in our wholesale business.\nOur wholesale operations include an upholstery plant in Newton, North Carolina that produces a wide range of upholstered furniture. We believe that we are an industry leader with our quick-ship custom upholstery offerings. We also operate a custom dining manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia. Most of our wood furniture and certain of our upholstery offerings are sourced through several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam, Indonesia and China. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced internationally. For fiscal 2015, approximately 37% of our wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 42% for fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015 we launched several significant new product categories. An important new product introduction in 2015 has been Bench Made\u201d, a selection of American dining furniture that appeared in retail showrooms during the second quarter of 2015. Partnering with nearby hardwood component manufacturers, we are preparing, distressing, finishing, and assembling an assortment of solid maple tables and chairs in our newly renovated Company-owned facility in Bassett, Virginia. Sales of Bench Made\u201d product during 2015 were ahead of our expectations. Also extremely significant is the second phase of our store assortment makeover that began with the introduction of new wood items and finishes last spring. We are planning to move to a living area centric floor plan that will focus more on the upholstery products that are driving our sales today complemented by both imported and domestically produced entertainment and occasional furnishings. All of these new products have been carefully designed in coordination with our merchants, designers, engineers and finishing technicians to achieve the upscale casual decor that we believe speaks to today's consumer. We will begin production in a new manufacturing facility in Grand Prairie, Texas in early March. The new plant will begin by producing a portion of the upholstery assortment for customers and stores in the Texas area and west.\nOur website, www.bassettfurniture.com, provides our consumers with the ability to research and purchase our merchandise online. The ultimate goal of our digital strategy is to drive traffic to our stores while deepening interactions with our consumers. We have worked diligently to enhance our online presence by making it easier for consumers to browse our wide array of goods and to design custom furniture. Late in 2015, we launched a new responsive platform allowing smartphone and tablet users to browse and purchase our product assortment on their mobile devices. Our e-commerce platform is simple, easy to use and amplifies the experience of the Bassett brand reflected in our stores, direct mail and television commercials. We constantly update our website to reflect current product availability, pricing and special offers. In 2016, we will continue to make improvements to our website to improve brand interaction and drive more qualified prospects to our stores. While sales through our website are currently not material, they have increased significantly in the last several years. We are leveraging our Company-owned and licensed store network to handle delivery and customer service for orders placed online.\nAnalysis of Operations\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of November, which periodically results in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2013 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal 2015 and 2014 each contained 52 weeks. Net sales revenue, cost of furniture and accessories sold, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, new store pre-opening costs, other charges, and income from operations were as follows for the years ended November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture and accessories\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of furniture and accessories sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New store pre-opening costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales for fiscal 2015 include the logistical services revenue of Zenith from customers outside of the Company since the date of acquisition on February 2, 2015. Sales of furniture and accessories, net of estimates for returns and allowances, were $387,405 for fiscal 2015 as compared to $340,738 for 2014 and $321,286 for 2013, representing increases of 13% and 6.1%, respectively. As noted above, fiscal 2013 contained 53 weeks while fiscal 2015 and 2014 contained 52 weeks. On an average weekly basis, sales for 2014 increased 8.1% over 2013. This trend primarily reflects the increase in the number of stores owned and operated by us, as well as growth in our wholesale shipments outside of our licensee network. Our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesale\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215,451 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistical services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inter-company eliminations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture and accessories\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(114,154 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99,886 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93,545 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistical services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,728 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income was $25,989 for 2015 as compared to $15,131 for 2014 and $10,005 for 2013. These increases have been primarily attributable to increased retail volume, the addition of Zenith, which contributed an additional $3,528 of operating income for fiscal 2015, and increased wholesale volume. Other charges of $974 during fiscal 2015 include lease exit costs of $419, asset impairment charges of $106, and a management restructuring charge of $449. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these charges.\nCertain other items affecting comparability between periods are discussed below in Other Items Affecting Net Income\u201d.\nSegment Information\nWe have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments as described below:\nWholesale. The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of Bassett stores (licensee-owned stores and Company-owned stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, including those corporate expenses related to both Company- and licensee-owned stores. We eliminate the sales between our wholesale and retail segments as well as the imbedded profit in the retail inventory for the consolidated presentation in our financial statements.\nRetail - Company-owned stores. Our retail segment consists of Company-owned stores and includes the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including real estate) and capital expenditures directly related to these stores.\nLogistical services. With our acquisition of Zenith on February 2, 2015, we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of Zenith. In addition to providing shipping, delivery and warehousing services for the Company, Zenith also provides similar services to other customers, primarily in the furniture industry. Revenue from the performance of these services to other customers is included in logistics revenue in our consolidated statement of income. Zenith's operating costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Amounts charged by Zenith to the Company for transportation and logistical services prior to February 2, 2015 are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and our equity in the earnings of Zenith prior to the date of acquisition is included in other loss, net, in the consolidated statements of income.\nPrior to the beginning of fiscal 2015, our former investments and real estate segment included our short-term investments, our holdings of retail real estate previously leased as licensee stores, and our former equity investment in Zenith prior to acquisition. This segment has been eliminated and the assets formerly reported therein are now considered to be part of our wholesale segment. The earnings and costs associated with these assets, including our equity in the income of Zenith prior to the date of acquisition, will continue to be included in other loss, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables illustrate the effects of various intercompany eliminations on income (loss) from operations in the consolidation of our segment

or 13%. This sales increase was driven by a 13% increase in shipments to the BHF store network and a 7.4% increase in open market shipments (outside the BHF store network). Gross margins for the wholesale segment decreased slightly to 33.1% for 2015 as compared to 33.2% for 2014. Wholesale SG&A increased $7,543 to $67,770 for 2015 as compared to $60,227 for 2014. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 26.9% for both fiscal 2015 and 2014. Included in SG&A for 2015 is an additional $850 in increased legal and environmental costs, an additional $541 of incentive compensation, and a $289 increase in bad debt costs largely associated with one remaining long-term note from a prior licensee. Also included in SG&A during 2015 are $209 of costs associated with the acquisition of Zenith. Operating income was $15,618 or 6.2% of sales for 2015 as compared to $14,120 or 6.3% of sales in 2014.\nFiscal 2014 as Compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet sales for the wholesale segment were $223,993 for 2014 as compared to $215,451 for 2013, an increase of $8,542, or 4%. On an average weekly basis (normalizing for the extra week in fiscal 2013), wholesale net sales increased 6%. Average weekly wholesale shipments to the open market (outside the Bassett Home Furnishings store network) for 2014 increased 10%, while average weekly shipments to the Bassett Home Furnishings store network increased by 4.2% compared to 2013. We gained market share in the traditional furniture store channel as recent product offerings were well received in 2014. Sales to our BHF store network were negatively impacted by slower business due to inclement weather during the winter months in early 2014 along with overall softness in the demand for wood furniture. Gross margins for the wholesale segment increased 30 basis points to 33.2% for 2014 as compared to 32.9% for 2013. This increase was primarily due to improved margins in the wood operations over the course of 2014 after discounting of discontinued product earlier in the year, and also due to the increased leveraging of fixed costs from higher sales volume in our upholstery operations. Wholesale SG&A increased $298 to $60,227 for 2014 as compared to $59,929 for 2013. SG&A costs as a percentage of sales decreased to 26.9% as compared to 27.6% for 2013 primarily due to tighter expense control. Income from operations was $14,120, or 6.3% of sales, for fiscal 2014 as compared to $10,883, or 5.1% of sales, for the prior year.\nWholesale Backlog\nThe dollar value of our wholesale backlog, representing orders received but not yet delivered to dealers and Company stores as of November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014, and November 30, 2013 was as follows:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year end wholesale backlog\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,916 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail Segment - Company Owned Stores\nNet sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, new store pre-opening costs and operating income (loss) for our Retail Segment were as follows for the years ended November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 vs 2014\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 vs 2013\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>216,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New store pre-opening costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(528 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(528 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,452 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables present operating results on a comparable store basis for each comparative set of periods.

The increase was primarily due to a $26,396 or 13% increase in comparable store sales coupled with a $6,352 increase in non-comparable store sales from 7 new stores opened in the last 24 months.\nWhile we do not recognize sales until goods are delivered to the consumer, management tracks written sales (the retail dollar value of sales orders taken, rather than delivered) as a key store performance indicator. Written sales for comparable stores increased by 11% for 2015 over 2014.\nThe consolidated retail operating income for 2015 was $6,170 as compared to a loss of $528 for 2014, a $6,698 improvement. The 53 comparable stores generated operating income of $7,468 for the year, or 3.3% of sales, as compared to $2,266, or 1.1% of sales, for the prior year. Gross margins were 50.0% for 2015, unchanged from the prior year. SG&A expenses for comparable stores increased $8,022 to $105,347 or 46.7% of sales as compared to 48.9% of sales for 2014. This decrease is primarily due to greater leverage of fixed costs due to higher sales volumes.\nLosses from the non-comparable stores in 2015 were $1,298 compared to $2,794 for 2014. This decrease is due in part to a decline in new store pre-opening costs from $1,217 recognized in 2014 due to the six new store openings during that year as compared with $623 in 2015 primarily associated with the Woodland Hills, California store which opened in early October of 2015. These costs included rent, training costs and other payroll-related costs specific to a new store location incurred during the period leading up to its opening and generally range between $100 to $300 per store based on the overall rent costs for the location and the period between the time when we take possession of the physical store space and the time of the store opening. Also included in the non-comparable store loss for 2014 was $983 in post-opening losses from six stores opened during 2014. We incur losses in the two to three months of operation following a store opening as sales are not recognized in the income statement until the furniture is delivered to its customers resulting in operating expenses without the normal sales volume. Because we do not maintain a stock of retail inventory that would result in quick delivery, and because of the custom nature of the furniture offerings, such deliveries are generally not made until after 30 days from when the furniture is ordered by the customer. Coupled with the pre-opening costs, total start-up losses typically amount to $300 to $500 per store.\nEach addition to our Company-owned store network results in incremental fixed overhead costs, primarily associated with local store personnel, occupancy costs and warehousing expenses. The incremental SG&A expenses associated with each new store will be ongoing.\nFiscal 2014 as Compared to Fiscal 2013\nNet sales for the 60 Company-owned stores were $216,631 for fiscal 2014 as compared to $199,380 for 2013, an increase of $17,251 or 8.7%. The increase was comprised of a $6,946 or 3.7% increase in comparable store sales and a $10,305 increase in non-comparable store sales. On an average weekly basis (normalizing for the extra week in the first quarter of 2013), comparable store sales increased 5.7%.\nWhile we do not recognize sales until goods are delivered to the consumer, we track written sales (the retail dollar value of sales orders taken, rather than delivered) as a key store performance indicator. Written sales for comparable stores increased by 4.3% for fiscal 2014 as compared to 2013. On an average weekly basis, written sales increased 6.4% over the prior year.\nThe operating loss for the 60 Company-owned stores for fiscal 2014 was $528 as compared to an operating loss of $1,452 for 2013. This decline in the consolidated retail operating loss was primarily due to improved margins, partially offset by increased new store related opening costs, overlapping rent costs during the transition period for store relocations, and initial operating losses at newly opened locations.\nThe 51 comparable stores generated operating income of $2,179 for 2014 as compared to $237 for the prior year. Gross margins at our comparable stores improved to 49.9% compared to 48.4% in the prior year due primarily to improved pricing strategies. SG&A expenses for comparable stores increased $4,337 to $94,726 or 48.8% of sales as compared to 48.3% for 2013. This increase is primarily due to planned increases in advertising spending, higher health care benefit costs, increased other overhead costs as the store network continues to grow and the effects of having one less week to leverage fixed costs. In addition, we incurred $222 of overlapping rent while two stores were in the process of being relocated. As with new store openings as described below, we begin to recognize rent expense at the date we take possession of the new store location. We recognized rent expense on both locations until the date that the previously existing store closed. We completed relocations in Little Rock, Arkansas and Boston, Massachusetts during fiscal 2014, with two additional relocations in Texas expected which were completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015. We define a store relocation as the closing of one store and opening of another store in the same market. Since there is no change in the store count for a specific market, we continue to include relocation costs as part of the comparable store operations.\nLosses from the non-comparable stores during fiscal 2014 were $2,707 which includes $1,217 of costs incurred prior to the opening of six stores during the year. These costs include rent, training costs and other payroll-related costs specific to a new store location incurred during the period leading up to its open and generally range between $100 to $300 per store based on the overall rent costs for the location and the period between the time when we take physical possession of the store space and the time when the store opens. Also included in the non-comparable store loss is $983 in post-opening losses from these six store openings. We incur losses in the first two to three months of operation following a store opening as sales are not recognized in the income statement until the furniture is delivered to its customers resulting in operating expenses without the normal sales volume. Because we do not maintain a stock of retail inventory that would result in quick delivery, and because of the custom nature of the furniture offerings, such deliveries are generally not made until after 30 days from when the furniture is ordered by the customer. Coupled with the pre-opening costs, total start-up losses typically amount to $300 to $500 per store. The remaining non-comparable stores incurred an operating loss of $507 during 2014.\nEach addition to our Company-owned store network results in incremental fixed overhead costs, primarily associated with local store personnel, occupancy costs and warehousing expenses. The incremental SG&A expenses associated with each new store will be ongoing.\nRetail Comparable Store Sales Increases\nThe following table provides year-over-year comparable store sales increases for the last three fiscal years:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td>(1) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Delivered\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Written\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The reported amounts for fiscal 2013 reflect the fact that 2013 contained 53 weeks versus 52 weeks for the preceding year.

For fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate of approximately 35.9% differs from the statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on the gain associated with our acquisition of Zenith arising from the remeasurement of our previous 49% equity method investment in Zenith. For fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate of approximately 36.3% differs from the statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the effects of state income taxes, adjustments to state net operating loss carryforwards, a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and permanent differences arising from non-taxable income. For fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate of approximately 37.8% differs from the statutory rate of 34.0% primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and permanent differences arising from non-deductible expenses. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our income tax provision (benefit), as well as our net deferred tax assets and other matters.\nWe have net deferred tax assets of $13,470 as of November 28, 2015, which, upon utilization, are expected to reduce our cash outlays for income taxes in future years. It will require approximately $35,000 of future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather difficult industry conditions, to allow us to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve, and to execute our long-term retail strategies.\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operations for fiscal 2015 was $32,398 compared to $29,961 for fiscal 2014, an increase of $2,437. The improvement is primarily the result of higher operating income, partially offset by increases in inventory levels due to the introduction of new products and increased purchase activity to support higher order volume.\nOur overall cash position increased by $9,595 during 2015. Offsetting the cash provided by operations, we used $19,661 of cash in investing activities, primarily consisting of: cash paid for the acquisition of Zenith (net of cash acquired); a capital contribution made to Zenith prior to the acquisition; capital expenditures which included retail store relocations, retail store remodels, and in-process spending on new stores, expanding and upgrading our manufacturing capabilities, and the purchase of freight transportation equipment. Net cash used in financing activities was $3,132, including dividend payments of $5,786 and stock repurchases of $2,071 under our existing share repurchase plan, of which $17,929 remains authorized at November 28, 2015. These uses were partially offset by net proceeds and excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options. With cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $59,393 on hand at November 28, 2015, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for the foreseeable future.\nDebt and Other Obligations\nOur credit facility with our bank provides for a line of credit of up to $15,000 and is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory. The facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain key financial ratios. We are in compliance with all covenants under the agreement and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future. The line matured in December 2015 but has been temporarily extended while we are in negotiations with our bank for a new line, which we expect to obtain during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 under substantially similar terms, except that the line is expected to be unsecured. We have $1,970 outstanding under standby letters of credit against our line, leaving availability under our credit line of $13,030. In addition, we have outstanding standby letters of credit with another bank totaling $356.\nAt November 28, 2015 we have outstanding principal totaling $14,085, excluding discounts, under notes payable of which $5,477 matures within one year of the balance sheet date. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding these notes, including collateral and future maturities. We expect to satisfy these obligations as they mature using cash flow from operations or our available cash on hand.\nWe lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our Company-owned retail stores as well as in the operation of certain of our licensee-owned stores, and we lease land and buildings at various locations throughout the continental United States for warehousing and distribution hubs used in our logistical services segment. We also lease tractors, trailers and local delivery trucks used in our logistical services segment. We had obligations of $124,897 at November 28, 2015 for future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year. We also have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators. Remaining terms under these lease guarantees range from approximately one to five years. We were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of $2,494 at November 28, 2015. See Note 17 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our leases and lease guarantees.\nDividends and Share Repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2015, we declared four quarterly dividends totaling $3,684, or $0.34 per share, and one special dividend of $2,184, or $0.20 per share. Cash dividend payments to our shareholders during fiscal 2014 totaled $5,786. During fiscal 2015, we also repurchased 76,350 shares of our stock for $2,071 under our share repurchase program. The weighted-average effect of these share repurchases was to increase both our basic and diluted earnings per share in 2015 by approximately $0.01.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe currently anticipate that total capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 will be approximately $20 million which will be used primarily for the build out of new stores and remodeling existing Company-owned stores in our retail segment, and the purchase of transportation equipment for our logistical services segment. Our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may change depending on many factors, including but not limited to the overall performance of the new stores, our rate of growth, our operating results and any adjustments in our operating plan needed in response to industry conditions, competition or unexpected events. We believe that our existing cash, together with cash from operations, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for items measured at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820's valuation techniques are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect readily obtainable data from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. ASC 820 classifies these inputs into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1 Inputs- Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 Inputs- Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 Inputs- Instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers.\nWe believe that the carrying amounts of our current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items. The recurring estimate of the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable for disclosure purposes (see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) involves Level 3 inputs. Our primary non-recurring fair value estimates, typically involving the valuation of business acquisitions (see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and asset impairments (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) have utilized Level 3 inputs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe enter into contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the ordinary course of business (See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of these obligations). The following table summarizes our contractual payment obligations and other commercial commitments and the fiscal year in which they are expected to be paid.\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Post employment benefit obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,477 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,803 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>543 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,085 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other obligations & commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,460 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual advertising\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,135 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,326 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,576 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>124,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease guarantees (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Does not reflect a reduction for the impact of any company owned life insurance proceeds to be received.

See Contractual Obligations and Commitments table above and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further discussion of operating leases and lease guarantees, including descriptions of the terms of such commitments and methods used to mitigate risks associated with these arrangements.\nContingencies\nWe are involved in various claims and litigation as well as environmental matters, which arise in the normal course of business. Although the final outcome of these legal and environmental matters cannot be determined, based on the facts presently known, it is our opinion that the final resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. We use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may, as warranted, solicit external advice. Estimates are based on current facts and circumstances, prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable. The following critical accounting policies, some of which are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates, affect our consolidated financial statements.\nConsolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bassett Furniture Industries, Incorporated and its majority-owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control. In accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, we have evaluated our licensees and certain other entities to determine whether they are variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) of which we are the primary beneficiary and thus would require consolidation in our financial statements. To date we have concluded that none of our licensees nor any other of our counterparties represent VIEs.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer. This generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or, in the case of Company-owned retail stores, upon delivery to the customer. Our wholesale payment terms generally vary from 30 to 60 days. For retail sales, we typically receive a significant portion of the purchase price as a customer deposit upon order, with the balance typically collected upon delivery. An estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales. The contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us. For our logistical services segment, line-haul freight revenue and home delivery revenue are recognized upon delivery to the destination. Warehousing services revenue is based upon warehouse space occupied by a customer's goods and inventory movements in and out of a warehouse and is recognized as such services are provided.\nStaff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition ( SAB 104\u201d) outlines the four basic criteria for recognizing revenue as follows: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the seller's price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. SAB 104 further asserts that if collectibility of all or a portion of the revenue is not reasonably assured, revenue recognition should be deferred until payment is received. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, there were no dealers for which these criteria were not met.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our accounts receivable reserves were $1,175 and $1,249 at November 28, 2015 and November 29, 2014, respectively, representing 5.3% and 7.6% of our gross accounts receivable balances at those dates, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified customer accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis. We evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees and other customers on a quarterly basis based on factors such as their financial condition, our collateral position, potential future plans with licensees and other similar factors. Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivable and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience, current developments and present economic conditions and trends. Although actual losses have not differed materially from our previous estimates, future losses could differ from our current estimates. Unforeseen events such as a licensee or customer bankruptcy filing could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nInventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last-in, first-out method. The cost of imported inventories is determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write-offs, taking into account future demand and market conditions. Our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $1,397 and $1,412 at November 28, 2015 and November 29, 2014, respectively, representing 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively, of our inventories on a last-in, first-out basis. If actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required.\nValuation Allowance on Deferred Tax Assets - We evaluate our deferred income tax assets to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted. A valuation allowance is established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not\u201d standard. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. During fiscal 2014, reductions in the reserve related to changes in laws which impact our ability to recover certain state net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a credit to income of $974, which is included in our net income tax expense for 2014. The remaining valuation allowance at November 28, 2015 is $0.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. The acquisition of assets and liabilities and any resulting goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit; Wood, Upholstery, Retail or Logistical Services. We review goodwill at the reporting unit level annually for impairment or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill & Other, the goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process, if necessary. However, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test described in ASC Topic 350. The more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing the two-step impairment test is unnecessary and our goodwill is considered to be unimpaired. However, if based on our qualitative assessment we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we will proceed with performing the two-step process. Based on our qualitative assessment as described above, we have concluded that our goodwill in the amount of $11,588 is not impaired as of November 28, 2015.\nThe first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit. Should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit, the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. This second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date. Our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors. While we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts.\nOther Intangible Assets - Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or between annual tests when an impairment indicator exists. The recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value. If we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess would be recorded. At November 28, 2015, our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill consist of trade names acquired in the acquisition of Zenith and have a carrying value of $2,490.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets and ratably amortize the value over the estimated useful lives of those assets. If the estimates of the useful lives should change, we will amortize the remaining book value over the remaining useful lives or, if an asset is deemed to be impaired, a write-down of the value of the asset may be required at such time. At November 28, 2015 our definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships and customized technology applications acquired in the acquisition of Zenith with a total carrying value of $3,604.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - We periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long-lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision. When such events or circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset. In the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value is recorded. When analyzing our real estate properties for potential impairment, we consider such qualitative factors as our experience in leasing and selling real estate properties as well as specific site and local market characteristics. Upon the closure of a Bassett Home Furnishings store, we generally write off all tenant improvements which are only suitable for use in such a store.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding the impact or potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements upon our financial position and results of operations.", "summary": "The report discusses Bassett's operations and financial performance.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Amounts in thousands except share and per share data)\nOverview\nBassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings ( BHF\u201d) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers, specialty stores and mass merchants. We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 113-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything that we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy.\nWith 93 BHF stores at November 28, 2015, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories. We created our store program in 1997 to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service. The store features custom order furniture ready for delivery in less than 30 days, more than 1,000 upholstery fabrics, free in-home design visits, and coordinated decorating accessories. We believe that our capabilities in custom upholstery have become unmatched in recent years. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its delivery. The selling philosophy in the stores is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer. Sales people are referred to as Design Consultants and are each trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor. We continue to strengthen the sales and design talent within our Company-owned retail stores. Our Design Consultants undergo extensive Design Certification training. This training has strengthened their skills related to our house call and design business, and is intended to increase business with our most valuable customers.\nIn order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers, specialty stores and mass merchants. We use a network of over 25 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.\nFor many years we owned 49% of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC ( Zenith\u201d). During that time the strategic significance of our partnership with Zenith had risen to include the over-the-road transportation of furniture, the operation of regional freight terminal, warehouse and distribution facilities in eleven states, and the management of various home delivery facilities that service Bassett Home Furnishings stores and other clients in local markets around the United States. On February 2, 2015, we acquired the remaining 51% of Zenith, which now operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bassett. Our acquisition of Zenith brings to our Company the ability to deliver best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of the furniture industry, as well as the ability to provide the expedited delivery service which is increasingly demanded by our industry. We believe that our ownership of Zenith will not only enhance our own wholesale and retail distribution capabilities, but will provide additional growth opportunities as Zenith continues to expand its service to other customers.\nIn September of 2011, we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with HGTV (Home and Garden Television), a division of Scripps Networks, LLC, which combines our heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of 96 million households in the United States that HGTV enjoys today. As part of this alliance, the in-store design centers have been co-branded with HGTV to more forcefully market the concept of a home makeover\u201d, an important point of differentiation for our stores that also mirrors much of the programming content on the HGTV network. We believe the new co-branded design centers coupled with the targeted national advertising on HGTV have played a key role in our improved comparable store sales since their introduction. In October of 2015, we announced the extension of our partnership with HGTV through 2019. While continuing to feature HGTV branded custom upholstery products in our HGTV HOME Design Studios in Bassett Home Furnishings stores, we will now expand the concept to select independent dealers. We believe this will provide additional growth outside our BHF store network.\nAt November 28, 2015, our BFH store network included 60 Company-owned stores and 33 licensee-owned stores. Due to the improved operating performance of our retail network along with continued improvement in underlying economic factors such as the housing market and consumer confidence, we have been expanding our retail presence in various parts of the country. As part of this expansion we opened one new store and relocated two stores during fiscal 2015 while opening six new stores and relocating two stores in fiscal 2014. We plan to continue opening new stores, primarily in underpenetrated markets where we currently have stores. In this regard we are currently considering several locations for new store expansion over the next three years, with at least three of these planned to open in fiscal 2016. We continue to evaluate all stores in our fleet and plan to close three underperforming stores this year as well.\nAs with any retail operation, prior to opening a new store we incur such expenses as rent, training costs and other payroll related costs. These costs generally range between $100 to $300 per store depending on the overall rent costs for the location and the period between the time when we take physical possession of the store space and the time of the store opening. Generally, rent payments during a buildout period between delivery of possession and opening of a new store are deferred and therefore straight line rent expense recognized during that time does not require cash. Inherent in our retail business model, we also incur losses in the two to three months of operation following a new store opening. Like other furniture retailers, we do not recognize a sale until the furniture is delivered to our customer. Because our retail business model does not involve maintaining a stock of retail inventory that would result in quick delivery and because of the custom nature of many of our furniture offerings, delivery to our customers usually occurs about 30 days after an order is placed. We generally require a deposit at the time of order and collect the remaining balance when the furniture is delivered, at which time the sale is recognized. Coupled with the previously discussed store pre-opening costs, total start-up losses can range from $300 to $500 per store. While our retail expansion is initially costly, we believe our site selection and new store presentation will generally result in locations that operate at or above a retail break-even level within a reasonable period of time following store opening. Factors affecting the length of time required to achieve this goal on a store-by-store basis may include the level of brand recognition, the degree of local competition and the depth of penetration in a particular market. Even as new stores ramp up to break-even, we do realize additional wholesale sales volume that leverages the fixed costs in our wholesale business.\nOur wholesale operations include an upholstery plant in Newton, North Carolina that produces a wide range of upholstered furniture. We believe that we are an industry leader with our quick-ship custom upholstery offerings. We also operate a custom dining manufacturing facility in Martinsville, Virginia. Most of our wood furniture and certain of our upholstery offerings are sourced through several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam, Indonesia and China. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced internationally. For fiscal 2015, approximately 37% of our wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 42% for fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015 we launched several significant new product categories. An important new product introduction in 2015 has been Bench Made\u201d, a selection of American dining furniture that appeared in retail showrooms during the second quarter of 2015. Partnering with nearby hardwood component manufacturers, we are preparing, distressing, finishing, and assembling an assortment of solid maple tables and chairs in our newly renovated Company-owned facility in Bassett, Virginia. Sales of Bench Made\u201d product during 2015 were ahead of our expectations. Also extremely significant is the second phase of our store assortment makeover that began with the introduction of new wood items and finishes last spring. We are planning to move to a living area centric floor plan that will focus more on the upholstery products that are driving our sales today complemented by both imported and domestically produced entertainment and occasional furnishings. All of these new products have been carefully designed in coordination with our merchants, designers, engineers and finishing technicians to achieve the upscale casual decor that we believe speaks to today's consumer. We will begin production in a new manufacturing facility in Grand Prairie, Texas in early March. The new plant will begin by producing a portion of the upholstery assortment for customers and stores in the Texas area and west.\nOur website, www.bassettfurniture.com, provides our consumers with the ability to research and purchase our merchandise online. The ultimate goal of our digital strategy is to drive traffic to our stores while deepening interactions with our consumers. We have worked diligently to enhance our online presence by making it easier for consumers to browse our wide array of goods and to design custom furniture. Late in 2015, we launched a new responsive platform allowing smartphone and tablet users to browse and purchase our product assortment on their mobile devices. Our e-commerce platform is simple, easy to use and amplifies the experience of the Bassett brand reflected in our stores, direct mail and television commercials. We constantly update our website to reflect current product availability, pricing and special offers. In 2016, we will continue to make improvements to our website to improve brand interaction and drive more qualified prospects to our stores. While sales through our website are currently not material, they have increased significantly in the last several years. We are leveraging our Company-owned and licensed store network to handle delivery and customer service for orders placed online.\nAnalysis of Operations\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of November, which periodically results in a 53-week year. Fiscal 2013 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal 2015 and 2014 each contained 52 weeks. Net sales revenue, cost of furniture and accessories sold, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, new store pre-opening costs, other charges, and income from operations were as follows for the years ended November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013:\n\nSales for fiscal 2015 include the logistical services revenue of Zenith from customers outside of the Company since the date of acquisition on February 2, 2015. Sales of furniture and accessories, net of estimates for returns and allowances, were $387,405 for fiscal 2015 as compared to $340,738 for 2014 and $321,286 for 2013, representing increases of 13% and 6.1%, respectively. As noted above, fiscal 2013 contained 53 weeks while fiscal 2015 and 2014 contained 52 weeks. On an average weekly basis, sales for 2014 increased 8.1% over 2013. This trend primarily reflects the increase in the number of stores owned and operated by us, as well as growth in our wholesale shipments outside of our licensee network. Our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows:\n\nOperating income was $25,989 for 2015 as compared to $15,131 for 2014 and $10,005 for 2013. These increases have been primarily attributable to increased retail volume, the addition of Zenith, which contributed an additional $3,528 of operating income for fiscal 2015, and increased wholesale volume. Other charges of $974 during fiscal 2015 include lease exit costs of $419, asset impairment charges of $106, and a management restructuring charge of $449. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these charges.\nCertain other items affecting comparability between periods are discussed below in Other Items Affecting Net Income\u201d.\nSegment Information\nWe have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments as described below:\nWholesale. The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of Bassett stores (licensee-owned stores and Company-owned stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, including those corporate expenses related to both Company- and licensee-owned stores. We eliminate the sales between our wholesale and retail segments as well as the imbedded profit in the retail inventory for the consolidated presentation in our financial statements.\nRetail - Company-owned stores. Our retail segment consists of Company-owned stores and includes the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including real estate) and capital expenditures directly related to these stores.\nLogistical services. With our acquisition of Zenith on February 2, 2015, we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of Zenith. In addition to providing shipping, delivery and warehousing services for the Company, Zenith also provides similar services to other customers, primarily in the furniture industry. Revenue from the performance of these services to other customers is included in logistics revenue in our consolidated statement of income. Zenith's operating costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Amounts charged by Zenith to the Company for transportation and logistical services prior to February 2, 2015 are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and our equity in the earnings of Zenith prior to the date of acquisition is included in other loss, net, in the consolidated statements of income.\nPrior to the beginning of fiscal 2015, our former investments and real estate segment included our short-term investments, our holdings of retail real estate previously leased as licensee stores, and our former equity investment in Zenith prior to acquisition. This segment has been eliminated and the assets formerly reported therein are now considered to be part of our wholesale segment. The earnings and costs associated with these assets, including our equity in the income of Zenith prior to the date of acquisition, will continue to be included in other loss, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables illustrate the effects of various intercompany eliminations on income (loss) from operations in the consolidation of our segment results:\n\n\n\n (1) Represents the elimination of sales from our wholesale segment to our Company-owned BHF stores. (2) Represents the elimination of logistical services billed to our wholesale and retail segments. (3) Represents the elimination of purchases by our Company-owned BHF stores from our wholesale segment, as well as the change for the period in the elimination of intercompany profit in ending retail inventory. (4) Represents the elimination of rent paid by our retail stores occupying Company-owned real estate, and for the year ended November 28, 2015, logisitcal services expense incurred from Zenith by our retail and wholesale segments. (5) Excludes the effects of asset impairment charges, lease exit costs and management restructuring costs which are not allocated to our segments. \nWholesale Segment\nNet sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense and operating income (loss) from operations for our Wholesale Segment were as follows for the years ended November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013:\n\nWholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Net sales revenue, cost of furniture and accessories sold, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense, new store pre-opening costs, other charges, and income from operations were as follows for the years ended November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013:\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture and accessories\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>387,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistics\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net sales revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>430,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>321,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of furniture and accessories sold\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SG&A\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>224,050 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,073 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>155,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New store pre-opening costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>974 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales for fiscal 2015 include the logistical services revenue of Zenith from customers outside of the Company since the date of acquisition on February 2, 2015. Sales of furniture and accessories, net of estimates for returns and allowances, were $387,405 for fiscal 2015 as compared to $340,738 for 2014 and $321,286 for 2013, representing increases of 13% and 6.1%, respectively. As noted above, fiscal 2013 contained 53 weeks while fiscal 2015 and 2014 contained 52 weeks. On an average weekly basis, sales for 2014 increased 8.1% over 2013. This trend primarily reflects the increase in the number of stores owned and operated by us, as well as growth in our wholesale shipments outside of our licensee network. Our consolidated net sales by segment were as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Wholesale\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>223,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215,451 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>199,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistical services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inter-company eliminations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Furniture and accessories\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(114,154 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99,886 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93,545 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Logistical services\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,728 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated net sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>430,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>340,738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income was $25,989 for 2015 as compared to $15,131 for 2014 and $10,005 for 2013. These increases have been primarily attributable to increased retail volume, the addition of Zenith, which contributed an additional $3,528 of operating income for fiscal 2015, and increased wholesale volume. Other charges of $974 during fiscal 2015 include lease exit costs of $419, asset impairment charges of $106, and a management restructuring charge of $449. See Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these charges.\nCertain other items affecting comparability between periods are discussed below in Other Items Affecting Net Income\u201d.\nSegment Information\nWe have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments as described below:\nWholesale. The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of Bassett stores (licensee-owned stores and Company-owned stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, including those corporate expenses related to both Company- and licensee-owned stores. We eliminate the sales between our wholesale and retail segments as well as the imbedded profit in the retail inventory for the consolidated presentation in our financial statements.\nRetail - Company-owned stores. Our retail segment consists of Company-owned stores and includes the revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including real estate) and capital expenditures directly related to these stores.\nLogistical services. With our acquisition of Zenith on February 2, 2015, we created the logistical services operating segment which reflects the operations of Zenith. In addition to providing shipping, delivery and warehousing services for the Company, Zenith also provides similar services to other customers, primarily in the furniture industry. Revenue from the performance of these services to other customers is included in logistics revenue in our consolidated statement of income. Zenith's operating costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Amounts charged by Zenith to the Company for transportation and logistical services prior to February 2, 2015 are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and our equity in the earnings of Zenith prior to the date of acquisition is included in other loss, net, in the consolidated statements of income.\nPrior to the beginning of fiscal 2015, our former investments and real estate segment included our short-term investments, our holdings of retail real estate previously leased as licensee stores, and our former equity investment in Zenith prior to acquisition. This segment has been eliminated and the assets formerly reported therein are now considered to be part of our wholesale segment. The earnings and costs associated with these assets, including our equity in the income of Zenith prior to the date of acquisition, will continue to be included in other loss, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of income.\nThe following tables illustrate the effects of various intercompany eliminations on income (loss) from operations in the consolidation of our segment
