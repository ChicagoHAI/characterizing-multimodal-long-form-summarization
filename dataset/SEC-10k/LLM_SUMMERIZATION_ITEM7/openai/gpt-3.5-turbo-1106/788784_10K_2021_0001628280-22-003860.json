MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThis combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) and Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf.\nPSEG's business consists of two reportable segments, PSE&G and PSEG Power LLC (PSEG Power), our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:\n\u2022PSE&G-which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and\n\u2022PSEG Power-which is a multi-regional energy supply company that integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. PSEG Power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states in which they operate. PSEG Power is no longer a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant; however, it continues to be consolidated and reported in PSEG's financial statements as a wholly owned subsidiary and operating segment.\nIn August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 megawatts (MW) fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. As a result, disclosures in this Item 7 and elsewhere in this document that relate solely to this 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio, except for those related to certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale transactions, primarily for obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the Connecticut Transfer Act, are no longer relevant to our business.\nPSEG's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which holds our investments in offshore wind ventures and legacy portfolio of lease investments; PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement (OSA); and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\nOur business discussion in Item 1. Business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2021 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\nFor a discussion of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2020 Annual Report) as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2021 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\nWe are progressing on our strategy to become a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a contracted carbon-free energy infrastructure company. We are focused on meeting customer expectations and being well aligned with public policy objectives by investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability, increase energy efficiency and deliver cleaner energy. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth while controlling costs and managing the risks associated with regulatory and policy changes and fluctuating commodity prices. In furtherance of these goals, over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G, which improves\nthe sustainability and predictability of our earnings and cash flows. In June 2021, we completed the sale of PSEG Power's solar portfolio and in August 2021 we entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 MW of fossil generation located in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Maryland. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generation portfolio, which represented an important milestone in our strategy and has further altered our business mix, resulting in an even higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G going forward and provides more financial flexibility. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nPSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG LI are providing essential services during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We have implemented a comprehensive set of enhanced safety actions to help protect our employees, customers and communities, and we will continue to closely monitor developments and adjust as needed to ensure that we provide reliable service while protecting the safety and health of our workforce and the communities we serve. We continue to be guided by the recommendations of health authorities at the federal, state and local levels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated government actions and economic effects continue to impact our businesses. We have incurred additional expenses to protect our employees and customers, and PSE&G is experiencing significantly higher customer bad debts and lower cash collections, as discussed below. The potential future impact of the pandemic and the associated economic impacts, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic, will depend on a number of factors outside of our control. These include the duration and severity of the outbreaks as well as third-party actions taken to contain their spread and mitigate their public health effects, and governmental or regulatory actions regarding customer collections, potential limitations on rate increases, recovery of incremental costs, and other matters. While we currently cannot estimate the potential impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, this MD&A includes a discussion of potential effects of a prolonged outbreak.\nPSE&G\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on enhancing reliability and resiliency of our T&D system, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy programs. For the years 2021-2025, PSE&G's capital investment program is estimated to be in a range of $14 billion to $16 billion, resulting in an expected compound annual growth in rate base of 6.5% to 8%. The low end of the range assumes an extension of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) and Clean Energy Future (CEF)-Energy Efficiency (EE) program at their average annual investment levels, as these programs are expected to continue at least at those current rates beyond their currently approved timeframe of 2023. The upper end of the range is driven by certain unapproved investment programs, including an Infrastructure Advancement Program (IAP) which we filed in November 2021. The IAP is a proposed $848 million investment program made over four years to improve the reliability of the last mile\u201d of our electric distribution system, address aging substations and gas metering and regulating stations and invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure at our facilities to support the electrification of our fleet over the coming years. The upper end of the range also includes an extension of our Energy Strong program, which otherwise concludes in 2023, as well as the remaining portion of our CEF proposal (portion of Electric Vehicle (EV) and Energy Storage (ES) programs) and a potentially higher amount of investment for GSMP and CEF-EE beyond current levels. During 2022, we expect to file for extensions of our GSMP and CEF-EE program, which we expect will conclude in the first half of 2023.\nIn September 2020, PSE&G reached a settlement with parties in the CEF-EE proceeding, which the BPU approved. The settlement commits $1 billion over a three-year period, with the majority of the investment occurring over a five-year period. Costs will be recovered through annual rate-making, with returns aligned with our most recent base rate case and a ten-year amortization period.\nThe approval also included a Conservation Incentive Program (CIP), a mechanism that provides for recovery of lost electric and gas variable margin revenues relative to a baseline of the test year (July 2017 to June 2018) set in in our last base rate case. The deferral period for this mechanism became effective in June 2021 for electric and October 2021 for gas. PSE&G suspended its gas Weather Normalization Charge (WNC) when the gas CIP began.\nIn January 2021, the BPU approved a settlement with PSE&G and other parties in the CEF-Energy Cloud (EC) proceeding. The capital cost of the program, which is driven by the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), is estimated to be $707 million, invested over the next four years.\nAlso in January 2021, the BPU approved a settlement with PSE&G and other parties in the CEF-EV proceeding for a majority of the components of the program. The approved investment under the program is for approximately $166 million, primarily relating to preparatory work to deliver infrastructure to the charging point for three programs: residential smart charging; Level-2 mixed use charging; and direct current fast charging. A remaining component of our program related to medium and heavy duty charging infrastructure was the subject of a stakeholder process at the BPU in 2021. We currently anticipate that this effort will conclude with PSE&G submitting a filing in mid-year 2022 targeting infrastructure investments for the medium and heavy duty EV market.\nAll of the capital costs and expenses of the CEF-EC and CEF-EV programs are expected to be recovered in PSE&G's next base rate case, expected to be filed with the BPU by the end of 2023. From the start of the program until the commencement of new base rates, the return on and of the capital portion of each of these programs, as well as expenses incurred to implement the CEF-EV program and operating costs and stranded costs associated with the retirement of existing meters under the CEF-EC program, will be included for recovery as part of our next rate case expected to be concluded in the second half of 2024. Our CEF-ES program is being held in abeyance pending future policy guidance from the BPU.\nWe also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure in order to (i) maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, (ii) ensure system resilience in the face of continued extreme weather conditions and cyber and physical security threats, (iii) address an aging transmission infrastructure, (iv) leverage technology to improve the operation of the system, (v) reduce transmission constraints, (vi) meet changing customer usage patterns and the demand for 24/7 electricity, and (vii) satisfy state public policy goals, including aggressive decarbonization agendas. As part of a solicitation by the BPU, we also proposed two transmission projects to support the development of offshore wind which are being evaluated by the BPU and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), with project awards expected in late 2022. As discussed further below, in October 2021, FERC approved PSE&G's settlement with the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (New Jersey Rate Counsel) regarding several amendments to our transmission formula rate, including the reduction of its base transmission return on equity (ROE) from 11.18% to 9.9%. Under current FERC rules, we continue to earn a 50 basis point adder to that base ROE for our membership in PJM.\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated impacts could have several negative consequences, including potential delays of our regulatory agencies' review and approval of proposed programs or rate recovery.\nThe coronavirus has also impacted PSE&G's sales, with a reduction in demand from its commercial and industrial (C&I) customers, largely offset by increases in residential sales volumes. As a result, there has been no substantive net margin impact and changes are now largely addressed through the CIP mechanism that became effective in 2021. The most substantive impact of the pandemic on our financial position has been adverse changes to residential and C&I payment patterns. The State of New Jersey issued an Executive Order in March 2020 that included a moratorium on non-safety related service disconnections for non-payment. On June 30, 2021, the moratorium imposed by the State of New Jersey ended but the State had established a grace period\u201d prohibiting disconnections for residential customers through December 31, 2021. On January 22, 2022, the State extended the grace period to March 15, 2022. Consequently, collections and shut-offs will not be in full effect until mid-March 2022. During the moratorium, PSE&G has experienced a significant decrease in cash inflow and higher Accounts Receivable aging and an associated increase in bad debt expense, which we expect will continue through the grace period and winter moratorium and take the next several years to fully return to normal levels. Since the start of the pandemic, PSE&G's allowance for credit losses has increased by approximately $265 million. PSE&G's electric distribution bad debt expense is recoverable through its Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) mechanism. PSE&G has deferred its incremental gas distribution bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19 as a Regulatory Asset and will seek recovery of that cost, as well as other net incremental COVID-19 costs, in its next base rate case. Collection efforts with C&I customers recommenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and residential customer collection efforts will recommence in March 2022, with a focus on enrolling customers in payment support programs. Any further moratoriums on shut-offs or collection processes could have a material effect on our cash flows, and, to the extent not fully recovered through a rate-making process, on our financial results and condition.\nIn July 2020, the BPU authorized regulated utilities in New Jersey, including PSE&G, to create a COVID-19-related Regulatory Asset by deferring on their books and records prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 through September 30, 2021 for recovery in a future rate case. In September 2021, the BPU extended the authorization to defer such costs through December 31, 2022. Deferred costs are to be offset by any federal or state assistance that the utility may receive as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, PSE&G has recorded a Regulatory Asset related to COVID-19 to defer incremental costs of $116 million, which PSEG believes are recoverable under the BPU Order.\nPSEG Power\nIn July 2020, we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's non-nuclear generating fleet with the intention of accelerating the transformation of our business into a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility, with a significantly contracted generation business. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nIn May 2021, PSEG Power Ventures LLC (Power Ventures), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG Power, entered into a purchase agreement with Quattro Solar, LLC, an affiliate of LS Power, relating to the sale by Power Ventures of 100% of its ownership interest in PSEG Solar Source LLC (Solar Source) including its related assets and liabilities. The transaction closed in June 2021.\nIn August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In\nFebruary 2022, PSEG completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. These transformative transactions are expected to reduce overall business risk and earnings volatility, improve PSEG's financial flexibility and are consistent with PSEG's climate strategy and sustainability efforts, which are to focus on clean energy investments, methane reduction, and the transition to carbon-free generation. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nWe have sought to achieve operational excellence and manage costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. During 2021, our natural gas and nuclear units generated 22.5 and 31.2 terawatt hours and operated at a capacity factor of 49.1% and 91.9%, respectively. PSEG Power's hedging practices help to manage some of the volatility of the merchant power business. More than 90% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2022 from the expected remaining generation assets after the sale of the fossil generation portfolio relates to hedging of our energy margin, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms, Zero Emission Certificate (ZEC) revenues and, certain gas operations and ancillary service payments such as reactive power. While this limits our exposure to decreasing prices, our ability to realize benefits from rising market prices is also limited. As a result of significantly rising energy prices, as experienced during the second half of 2021, PSEG Power experienced a substantial increase in net cash collateral postings related to hedge positions that are out-of-the-money. As of December 31, 2021, net cash collateral postings were $844 million.\nAs discussed further below under Wholesale Power Market Design,\u201d in July 2021, PJM submitted to FERC a proposal to replace the current Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR), which applies to both new and existing resources that receive out-of-market payments, with new provisions that accommodate state public policy programs that do not attempt to set the price of capacity. Under the PJM proposal, PSEG Power's New Jersey nuclear plants that receive ZEC payments would not be subject to the MOPR. PJM's proposal requested that FERC approve the new provisions for the next Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) auction. In September 2021, FERC issued a notice that it was not able to act on PJM's proposed changes to the MOPR because of a split among the Commissioners on the lawfulness of the proposal. Therefore, PJM's rules became automatically effective as of September 29, 2021 and will apply to the next base residual auction. In February, FERC approved PJM's filing requesting that the auction be held in June 2022.\nPSEG LI\nFollowing the effects of Tropical Storm Isaias, the New York Attorney General (AG) initiated an inquiry into PSEG LI's preparation and response to the storm. In addition, the Department of Public Service (DPS) within the New York State Public Service Commission launched an investigation of the State's electric service providers', including PSEG LI's, preparation and response to the storm. The DPS issued an interim storm investigation report finding that PSEG LI violated its Emergency Response Plan and DPS Regulations, and recommended that LIPA consider taking various actions, including terminating or renegotiating the OSA. LIPA also issued a report with recommendations for improvements to PSEG LI's structure and processes and recommended that LIPA either renegotiate or terminate the OSA.\nIn December 2020, LIPA filed a complaint against PSEG LI in New York State court alleging multiple breaches of the OSA in connection with PSEG LI's preparation for and response to Tropical Storm Isaias seeking specific performance and $70 million in damages. In June 2021, LIPA and PSEG LI executed a non-binding term sheet, which includes several changes to the OSA, including shifting a portion of our fixed revenues to incentive compensation and subjecting a portion of revenue to the potential imposition of penalties by the DPS due to certain performance failures by PSEG LI, and resolves all of LIPA's claims related to Tropical Storm Isaias and the DPS investigation. An amended OSA based on the term sheet was agreed to by the parties and approved by the LIPA Board in December 2021. In January 2022, the New York AG approved the Amended OSA and it has been submitted to the New York Comptroller for approval, which approval must occur by April 1, 2022 (such date is subject to amendment by mutual agreement of PSEG LI and LIPA) in order for the Amended OSA to become binding and effective. Such approval would result in retroactive effectiveness to January 1, 2022 for purposes of compensation. The OSA contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend for five years. No assurances can be given regarding obtaining the New York Comptroller approval and the closing of the inquiry by the AG.\nIn the event that the Amended OSA is not approved by the New York Comptroller by April 1, 2022, PSEG LI intends to vigorously defend itself with regard to the allegations in LIPA's complaint alleging breaches of the OSA. A decision in this proceeding requiring specific performance or the payment of damages by PSEG LI or resulting in the termination of the OSA could have a material adverse effect on PSEG's results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate Strategy and Sustainability Efforts\nFor more than a century, our mission has been to provide safe access to an around-the-clock supply of reliable, affordable energy. Building on this mission, we are working toward a future where customers universally use less energy, the energy they use is cleaner, and its delivery is safe, more reliable and more resilient. In June 2021, we accelerated and expanded our net zero vision by 20 years, establishing a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 goal that includes direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) at both PSEG Power and PSE&G (covering our electric and\nnatural gas utility operations), assuming advances in technology, public policy and customer behavior. Scope 1 emissions include power generation, methane leaks, vehicle fleet emissions, sulfur hexafluoride and refrigerant leaks. Scope 2 emissions include both gas and electric purchased energy for our PSE&G facilities and line losses. In September 2021, we also committed to the United Nations-backed Race to Zero campaign. We have agreed to develop and submit science-based emission reduction targets following the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative by September 2023. Targets will encompass Scopes 1, 2, and 3 (which includes downstream/customer use of energy products as well as purchased goods and services for our own operations) and must be in line with 1.5oC emissions scenarios.\nPSE&G has undertaken a number of initiatives that support the reduction of GHG emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives. PSE&G's recently approved CEF-EE, CEF-EC and CEF-EV programs and the proposed CEF-ES program are intended to support New Jersey's Energy Master Plan through programs designed to help customers increase their energy efficiency, support the expansion of the EV infrastructure in the State, install energy storage capacity to supplement solar generation and enhance grid resiliency, install smart meters and supporting infrastructure to allow for the integration of other clean energy technologies and to more efficiently respond to weather and other outage events.\nIn addition, PSE&G is committed to the safe delivery of natural gas to almost two million customers throughout New Jersey and we are equally committed to reducing GHG emissions associated with such operations. The first phase of our GSMP replaced approximately 450 miles of cast-iron and unprotected steel gas main infrastructure, and the second phase of this program is expected to replace an additional 875 miles of gas pipes through 2023. The GSMP is designed to significantly reduce natural gas leaks in our distribution system, which would reduce the release of methane, a potent GHG, into the air. Through GSMP II, from 2018 through 2023 we expect to reduce methane leaks by approximately 22% system wide and assuming a continuation of GSMP, we expect to achieve an overall reduction in methane emissions of approximately 60% over the 2011 through 2030 period. As noted previously, later in 2022 we will file for an extension of GSMP which would continue and accelerate these methane reductions. We also continue to assess physical risks of climate change and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events, notably through our investments in our Energy Strong program. These investments have proven effective in recent severe weather events, including Tropical Storm Ida in August 2021, which brought significant flooding to our service territory but did not result in the loss of any of our electric distribution substations.\nWe also continue to focus on providing cleaner energy for our customers. Our priority is to preserve the economic viability of our nuclear units, which provide over 90% of the carbon-free energy in New Jersey, by advocating for state and federal policies that recognize the value of emission-free generation and reduce market risk. We also continue to explore investment opportunities in offshore wind, both generation and transmission to support the cost-efficient connection of offshore wind generation projects to the New Jersey electric system.\nOffshore Wind\nIn December 2020, PSEG entered into a definitive agreement with \u00d8rsted North America Inc. (\u00d8rsted) to acquire a 25% equity interest in \u00d8rsted's Ocean Wind project which is currently in development. Ocean Wind was selected by New Jersey to be the first offshore wind farm as part of the State's intention to add 7,500 MW of offshore wind generating capacity by 2035. The Ocean Wind project is expected to achieve full commercial operation in 2025. On March 31, 2021, the BPU approved PSEG's investment in Ocean Wind and the acquisition was completed in April 2021.\nAdditionally, PSEG and \u00d8rsted each owns 50% of Garden State Offshore Energy LLC (GSOE) which holds rights to an offshore wind lease area just south of New Jersey. In December 2021, the Maryland Public Service Commission awarded \u00d8rsted's 846 MW Skipjack 2 project Offshore Renewable Energy Credits under Maryland's second round of offshore wind solicitations. Skipjack 2 utilizes a portion of the GSOE lease area, and PSEG has an option to purchase 50% of Skipjack 2 and the previously awarded 120 MW Skipjack 1 project, which will be constructed concurrently. PSEG expects to determine whether to exercise this option during 2022. PSEG and \u00d8rsted are also exploring further opportunities to develop the remaining GSOE lease area.\nIn April 2021, PJM announced the opening of the first public policy Order 1000 bid window that would utilize the state agreement approach for transmission projects to support New Jersey's planned offshore wind generation. The state agreement approach requires customers in the requesting state - in this case New Jersey - to pay for the costs of these public policy transmission projects. In September 2021, PSEG and \u00d8rsted jointly submitted several proposals in response to the solicitation, including multi-spur options and an offshore network proposal. If awarded, the projects would be developed through a 50/50 joint venture with \u00d8rsted. The BPU has announced that it will select the winning proposals in the second half of 2022 with likely in-service dates by 2030.\nOperational Excellence\nWe emphasize excellence in operational performance while developing opportunities in both our regulated and competitive businesses. In 2021, our utility continued its efforts to control costs while maintaining strong operational performance.\nFinancial Strength\nOur financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during 2021 as we\n\u2022maintained sufficient liquidity,\n\u2022completed the sale of PSEG Power's Solar Source units and 6,750 MW of fossil generation assets,\n\u2022maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and\n\u2022increased our annual dividend for 2021 to $2.04 per share and our indicative annual dividend per share for 2022 to $2.16.\nIn late September 2021, we announced a $500 million share repurchase program to be implemented upon the close of the sale of the fossil generating assets. In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized senior management to implement a share repurchase program at such time as senior management deemed appropriate in its discretion, whether before or after the closing of the sale of the fossil generating assets. In December 2021, under this authorization, we entered into an open market share repurchase plan for $250 million of our common shares. There were no common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2021. During January and through February 16, 2022, we purchased the full $250 million of common shares under the open market share repurchase plan.\nWe expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources without the issuance of new equity. Our planned capital requirements, which are driven by growth in our regulated utility, and the sale of our fossil generating fleet enhances our business profile and underpins solid investment grade credit ratings with improved financial flexibility. In conjunction with the announced sale of our Fossil business, in October 2021 we redeemed all of PSEG Power's remaining debt. see Item 8. Note 16. Debt and Credit Facilities for additional details.\nFinancial Results\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Millions, except per share data </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSE&G </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Power </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,056) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Net Income (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Net Income (Loss) Per Share (Diluted) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2021 Net Loss as compared to our 2020 Net Income was due to an impairment loss and related charges associated with the sale of PSEG Power's fossil generation assets. For a more detailed discussion of our financial results, see Results of Operations.\nThe greater emphasis on capital spending in recent years for projects at PSE&G relative to PSEG Power, particularly those on which we receive contemporaneous returns at PSE&G has yielded strong results, which has allowed us to meet customer needs and address market conditions and investor expectations. We continue our focus on operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment. These guiding principles have provided the base from which we have been able to execute our strategic initiatives.\nDisciplined Investment\nWe utilize rigorous criteria and consider a number of external factors, focusing on the value for our stakeholders, as well as other impacts, when determining how and when to efficiently deploy capital. We principally explore opportunities for investment in areas that complement our existing business and provide reasonable risk-adjusted returns and continuously assess and optimize our business mix as appropriate. In 2021, we\n\u2022made additional investments in T&D infrastructure projects on time and on budget,\n\u2022continued to execute our Energy Efficiency and other existing BPU-approved utility programs,\n\u2022closed on our acquisition of a 25% equity interest in the Ocean Wind project, and\n\u2022continued to evaluate potential additional offshore wind opportunities, including submitting a number of proposals in response to an offshore transmission solicitation.\nRegulatory, Legislative and Other Developments\nIn our pursuit of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment, we closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments. Transmission planning rules and wholesale power market design are of particular importance to our results and we continue to advocate for policies and rules that promote fair and efficient electricity markets. For additional information about regulatory, legislative and other developments that may affect us, see Item 1. Business-Regulatory Issues.\nTransmission Rate Proceedings and ROE\nIn March 2019, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking comments on improvements to FERC's electric transmission incentives policy. Subsequently, in April 2021, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to eliminate the incentive for Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) membership for transmitting utilities that have already received the incentive for three or more years. PSE&G began receiving a 50 basis point adder for RTO membership in 2008. Elimination of the adder for RTO membership could reduce PSE&G's annual Net Income and annual cash inflows by approximately $30 million-$40 million.\nIn October 2021, FERC approved a settlement agreement effective August 1, 2021 that we reached with the BPU and the New Jersey Rate Counsel about the level of PSE&G's base transmission ROE and other formula rate matters. The settlement reduces PSE&G's base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% and makes several other changes regarding the recovery of certain costs. The agreement provides that the settling parties will not seek changes to our transmission formula rate for three years. We have implemented the terms of the agreement and PJM issued refunds to customers in January 2022.\nWholesale Power Market Design\nIn July 2021, PJM submitted to FERC a proposal to replace the extended MOPR with new provisions that accommodate state public policy programs that do not attempt to set the price of capacity. Under the PJM proposal, PSEG Power's New Jersey nuclear plants that receive ZEC payments would not be subject to the MOPR. In September 2021, FERC issued a notice that it was not able to act on PJM's proposed changes to the MOPR because of a split among the Commissioners on the lawfulness of PJM's proposal. Therefore, PJM's rules became automatically effective as of September 29, 2021 and will apply to the next base residual auction, which has been delayed. In February, FERC approved PJM's filing requesting that the auction be held in June 2022.\nIn November 2021, a group of generators challenged the new MOPR rules in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on the grounds that FERC's inaction was unlawful. PSEG has intervened in the proceeding in support of the new MOPR rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nIn another order related to the auction, FERC found that the current rules related to the Market Seller Offer Cap were unjust and unreasonable and ultimately eliminated the default offer cap. In its place, FERC adopted a unit-specific approach to reviewing certain capacity market offers. These new rules could result in lower capacity prices since market offers for many resource types will need to be approved by the Independent Market Monitor and PJM.\nIn July 2021, the BPU issued a report on its investigation related to whether New Jersey can achieve its long-term clean energy and environmental objectives under the current resource adequacy procurement paradigm. The report found that participating in the regional market is the most efficient way for New Jersey to achieve its clean energy goals and therefore consideration of leaving the regional market is paused while important market reforms are being considered at the regional and national level. However, the report recommends that New Jersey continue to explore a New Jersey-only or regional competitive auction design if potential reforms at the regional and national level are not sufficient to allow New Jersey to achieve its clean energy goals. We cannot predict whether the BPU will take any measures in the future that will have an impact on the capacity market or our generating stations.\nIn January 2020, New Jersey rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). As a result, generating plants operating in New Jersey, including those owned by PSEG Power, that emit carbon dioxide emissions will be required to procure credits for each ton they emit. Following the close on the sale of the fossil generating assets, we no longer have generation subject to the RGGI compliance requirements.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs and penalties of remediating contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by Federal and State agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various statutes. In addition, PSEG Power will retain ownership of certain assets and liabilities\nexcluded from the sale of its fossil generation business, primarily related to obligations under certain environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the Connecticut Transfer Act. The amounts for any such environmental remediation are not estimable, but may be material. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs and penalties of any such remediation efforts could be material.\nFor further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 8. Note 15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\nNuclear\nIn April 2019, PSEG Power's Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded ZECs by the BPU. Pursuant to a process established by the BPU, ZECs are purchased from selected nuclear plants and recovered through a non-bypassable distribution charge in the amount of $0.004 per kilowatt-hour used (which is equivalent to approximately $10 per megawatt hour (MWh) generated in payments to selected nuclear plants (ZEC payment)). Each nuclear plant is expected to receive ZEC revenue for approximately three years, through May 2022.\nIn April 2021, PSEG Power's Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded ZECs for the three-year eligibility period starting June 2022 at the same approximate $10 per MWh received during the current ZEC period through May 2022 referenced above. As a result, each nuclear plant is expected to receive ZEC revenue for an additional three years starting June 2022. The terms and conditions of this April 2021 ZEC award are the same as the current ZEC period as discussed above. While the ZEC program has preserved these units to date, PSEG will simultaneously seek long-term legislative or other solutions for our New Jersey nuclear plants that sufficiently values them for their carbon-free, fuel diversity and resilience attributes. No assurances can be given regarding future ZEC awards or other long-term solutions.\nThe award of ZECs attaches certain obligations, including an obligation to repay the ZECs in the event that a plant ceases operations during the period that it was awarded ZECs, subject to certain exceptions specified in the ZEC legislation. PSEG Power has and will continue to recognize revenue monthly as the nuclear plants generate electricity and satisfy their performance obligations. Further, the ZEC payment may be adjusted by the BPU at any time to offset environmental or fuel diversity payments that a selected nuclear plant may receive from another source. For instance, the New Jersey Rate Counsel, in written comments filed with the BPU, has advocated for the BPU to offset market benefits resulting from New Jersey's rejoining the RGGI from the ZEC payment. PSEG intends to vigorously defend against these arguments. Due to its preliminary nature, PSEG cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nIn May 2021, the New Jersey Rate Counsel filed an appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division of the BPU's April 2021 decision. PSEG cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nIn the event that (i) the ZEC program is overturned or is otherwise materially adversely modified through legal process; or (ii) any of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants is not sufficiently valued for its environmental, fuel diversity or resilience attributes in future periods and does not otherwise experience a material financial change that would remove the need for such attributes to be sufficiently valued, PSEG Power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. Alternatively, even with sufficient valuation of these attributes, if the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by changes in commodity prices, FERC's changes to the capacity market construct (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the BPU in accordance with a FERC-authorized capacity mechanism), or, in the case of the Salem nuclear plants, decisions by the EPA and state environmental regulators regarding the implementation of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act and related state regulations, or other factors, PSEG Power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. Ceasing operations of these plants would result in a material adverse impact on PSEG's and PSEG Power's results of operations.\nTax Legislation\nA prolonged coronavirus pandemic, further economic stimulus, or future federal and state tax legislation could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and cash tax position.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, enacted in late December 2020, provides a 30% investment tax credit (ITC) for offshore wind projects that begin construction before December 31, 2025. In addition, on December 31, 2020, Notice 2021-05 was issued. For qualifying offshore wind projects, the notice extends the four year continuity safe harbor to ten calendar years commencing the calendar year after which construction of the project begins. This legislation and Notice will impact our offshore wind investment.\nIn July 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued final and proposed regulations addressing the limitation on deductible business interest expense contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These regulations retroactively allow depreciation to be added back in computing the 30% adjusted taxable income (ATI) cap, increasing the amount of interest that can be deducted by unregulated businesses in years before 2022. For 2022 and after, the regulations continue to disallow the addback of depreciation in the computation of ATI, effectively lowering the cap on the amount of deductible business interest. The portion\nof PSEG's and PSEG Power's business interest expense that was disallowed in 2018 and 2019 will now be deductible in those respective years.\nIn March 2020, the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted. The CARES Act allows a five-year carryback of any net operating loss (NOL) generated in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021. The CARES Act allowed us to carry back the 2018 tax NOL generated by the final Section 163(j) regulations, which will provide a future tax benefit, subject to approval by the IRS and the Joint Committee on Taxation.\nFuture Outlook\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance to capitalize on or otherwise address regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and to respond to the issues and challenges described below. In order to do this, we will continue to:\n\u2022obtain approval of and execute on our utility capital investment program to modernize our infrastructure, improve the reliability of the service we provide to our customers, and align our sustainability and climate goals with New Jersey's energy policy,\n\u2022focus on controlling costs while maintaining safety, reliability and customer satisfaction and complying with applicable standards and requirements,\n\u2022deliver on our human capital management strategy to attract, develop and retain a diverse, high-performing workforce,\n\u2022successfully manage our energy obligations and re-contract our open supply positions in response to changes in prices and demand,\n\u2022advocate for federal and state programs to properly value New Jersey's largest carbon-free generation resource in nuclear and measures that promote fair and efficient electricity markets, including recognition of the cost of emissions,\n\u2022engage constructively with our multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers, employees, investors, suppliers and the communities in which we do business,\n\u2022seek a fair return for our T&D investments through our transmission formula rate, distribution infrastructure and clean energy investment programs and periodic distribution base rate case proceedings,\n\u2022successfully operate the LIPA T&D system and manage LIPA's fuel supply and generation dispatch obligations, and\n\u2022manage the risks and opportunities in environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, which is an integral part of our long-term strategy to be a clean energy leader for the benefit of all stakeholders.\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K for 2021 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include:\n\u2022regulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to future energy policy, design of energy and capacity markets, transmission policy and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceedings,\n\u2022the continuing impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the associated regulations and economic impacts, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic,\n\u2022future changes in federal and state tax laws or any other associated tax guidance, and\n\u2022the impact of changes in demand, natural gas and electricity prices, and expanded efforts to decarbonize several sectors of the economy.\nWe continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term stockholder value and address the interests of our multiple stakeholders. In assessing our options, we consider a wide variety of factors, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; the views of investors, regulators, rating agencies, customers and employees; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. Strategic options available to us include:\n\u2022investments in PSE&G, including T&D facilities to enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize the system to meet the growing needs and increasingly higher expectations of customers, and clean energy investments such as CEF-EE, CEF-EV, CEF-ES and Solar,\n\u2022the further disposition or restructuring of our merchant generation business or portions thereof beyond the aforementioned sale of PSEG Power's fossil and solar generating assets or other existing businesses or the acquisition or development of new businesses,\n\u2022investments in regional offshore wind with long-term contracts or regulated transmission returns that provide revenue predictability and a reasonable risk-adjusted return,\n\u2022continued operation of our nuclear generation facilities, to the extent there is sufficient certainty that their operation will render an acceptable risk-adjusted return, and\n\u2022acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions involving our common stock, assets or businesses that could provide value to customers and shareholders.\nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully develop and execute any of the strategic options noted above, or any additional options we may consider in the future. The execution of any such strategic plan may not have the expected benefits or may have unexpected adverse consequences.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Earnings (Losses) </td> <td> </td> <td>Millions </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSE&G </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Power (A) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,056) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other (B) </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Net Income (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Net Income (Loss) Per Share (Diluted) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A)PSEG Power's results in 2021 include an after-tax impairment loss and other associated charges, including debt extinguishment costs, of $2,158 million related to the sale of PSEG Power's fossil generation assets.

increased $514 million due to changes in delivery, clause, commodity and other operating revenues.\nDelivery Revenues increased $221 million.\n\u2022Transmission revenues increased $113 million due to higher revenue requirements calculated through our transmission formula rate, primarily to recover required investments. The net increase in 2021 includes a reduction to the revenue requirement of approximately $64 million as a result of our ROE settlement approved by FERC effective August 1, 2021, partially offset by a $35 million flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes in 2020. The $35 million flowback was offset in Income Tax Expense in 2020.\n\u2022Gas distribution revenues increased $65 million due to increases of $42 million from collection of the GSMP in base rates, $18 million in CIP decoupling revenues, $7 million in collections of Green Program Recovery Charges (GPRC) and $7 million from higher sales volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $9 million in WNC revenues.\n\u2022Electric distribution revenues increased $59 million due primarily to $30 million from CIP decoupling revenue, $13 million in higher collections of GPRC, $9 million from an Energy Strong II rate roll-in and $7 million from higher sales volumes.\n\u2022Electric distribution and gas distribution revenue requirements were $16 million lower as a result of the flowback of excess deferred income tax liabilities and tax repair-related accumulated deferred income taxes. This decrease is offset in Income Tax Expense.\nClause Revenues increased $47 million due to $17 million in Tax Adjustment Credits (TAC) and GPRC deferrals, $28 million in higher Societal Benefits Charges (SBC) and $4 million in Margin Adjustment Clause (MAC) revenues. These increases were partially offset by $2 million in lower Solar Pilot Recovery Charge (SPRC) collections. The changes in TAC and GPRC Deferrals, SBC, MAC and SPRC collections were entirely offset by the amortization of related costs (Regulatory Assets) in O&M, D&A and Interest and Tax Expenses. PSE&G does not earn margin on TAC or GPRC deferrals or on SBC, MAC or SPRC collections.\nCommodity Revenues increased $217 million due to higher Gas revenues and Electric revenues. The changes in Commodity Revenues for both gas and electric are entirely offset by changes in Energy Costs. PSE&G earns no margin on the provision of basic gas supply service (BGSS) and BGS to retail customers.\n\u2022Gas revenues increased $143 million due primarily to higher BGSS prices of $110 million and higher BGSS sales volumes of $33 million.\n\u2022Electric revenues increased $74 million due to $118 million from higher BGS sales volumes, partially offset by $44 million from lower prices.\nOther Operating Revenues increased $29 million due to a $27 million increase primarily in appliance service revenues and a $25 million increase from the sale of Transition Renewable Energy Certificates (TREC). These increases were partially offset by a $20 million reduction in revenues from Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SREC) and a $3 million reduction in ZEC revenues. The changes in TREC, SREC and ZEC revenues are entirely offset by changes to Energy Costs.\nOperating Expenses\nEnergy Costs increased $219 million. This is entirely offset by changes in Commodity Revenues and Other Operating Revenues.\nOperation and Maintenance increased $78 million due primarily to increases of $46 million in clause and renewable expenditures, $16 million in appliance service costs, $11 million in transmission maintenance expenditures and $5 million in other operating expenses.\nDepreciation and Amortization increased $41 million due primarily to an increase in depreciation of $55 million due to additional plant placed into service and a $6 million increase from the amortization of software. These increases were partially offset by a $19 million decrease due to lower transmission depreciation rates effective August 1, 2021, which were included in the settlement of the formula rate and other matters.\nOther Income (Deductions) decreased $20 million due primarily to a decrease of $16 million in the Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFUDC) from lower transmission expenditures and a $4 million net decrease in solar loan interest and miscellaneous other income.\nNon-Operating Pension and OPEB Credits (Costs) increased $59 million due primarily to a $44 million decrease in interest cost and a $27 million increase in the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by a $6 million net increase in the amortization of net prior service cost and a $6 million net increase in amortization of the net actuarial loss.\nInterest Expense increased $14 million due primarily to increases of $6 million and $3 million due to net long-term debt issuances in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a $5 million increase due primarily to lower AFUDC.\nIncome Tax Expense increased $84 million due primarily to higher pre-tax income in 2021 and reduced flowback of excess deferred income tax liabilities in 2021, partially offset by the tax benefit from the CEF program investments.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019\nSee Item 7.

</tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 as compared to 2020\nOperating Revenues decreased $487 million due to changes in generation, gas supply and other operating revenues.\nGeneration Revenues decreased $668 million due primarily to\n\u2022a net decrease of $606 million due to higher MTM losses in 2021 as compared to 2020. Of this amount, there was a $624 million decrease due to changes in forward prices, partially offset by an $18 million increase due to less losses on positions reclassified to realized upon settlement in 2021,\n\u2022a net decrease of $288 million due primarily to $201 million from lower volumes of electricity sold under the BGS contracts, coupled with an $87 million impact from the transfer of responsibility for firm transmission services from BGS suppliers to the Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs), and\n\u2022a net decrease of $29 million in solar revenues due to the sale of the solar plants in June 2021,\n\u2022partially offset by a net increase of $188 million due primarily to higher average realized prices and higher volumes sold in the PJM, New England (NE) and New York (NY) regions, and\n\u2022a net increase of $64 million in capacity revenues due primarily to increases in auction prices, coupled with decreases in capacity charges due to lower BGS and other load obligations in the PJM region, partially offset by lower capacity prices and the retirement of the Bridgeport Harbor 3 (BH3) coal plant in the NE region.\nGas Supply Revenues increased $182 million due primarily to\n\u2022a net increase of $106 million in sales under the BGSS contract due primarily to higher prices of $72 million and higher sales volumes of $34 million, and\n\u2022a net increase of $74 million related to sales to third parties, of which $90 million was due to higher average sales prices, partially offset by $16 million due to lower volumes sold.\nOperating Expenses\nEnergy Costs represent the cost of generation, which includes fuel costs for generation as well as purchased energy in the market, and gas purchases to meet PSEG Power's obligation under its BGSS contract with PSE&G. Energy Costs increased $157 million due to\nGeneration costs decreased $13 million due primarily to\n\u2022a net decrease of $147 million in transmission costs due primarily to an $87 million impact from the transfer of responsibility for firm transmission services under BGS contracts from BGS suppliers to the EDCs, coupled with a $60 million decrease in other transmission costs, mainly from lower volumes of electricity sold under the BGS contracts, and\n\u2022a net decrease of $66 million due to higher net MTM gains in 2021. Of this amount, there was a $52 million decrease due to changes in forward prices, coupled with a $14 million decrease due to more gains on positions reclassified to realized upon settlement in 2021,\n\u2022partially offset by a net increase of $157 million in fuel costs, reflecting higher gas prices and higher volumes in the PJM, NY, and NE regions, and\n\u2022a net increase of $42 million in energy purchases due primarily to an increase in purchased volumes in the PJM region to meet physical energy sales. This was partially offset by a decrease in renewable energy credit requirements caused by decreases in load served in the PJM region.\nGas costs increased $170 million due primarily to\n\u2022a net increase of $103 million in costs related to sales under the BGSS contract, of which $74 million was due to the higher average cost of gas and $29 million to higher send out volumes. Included in the 2020 average cost of gas were $18 million of interstate gas pipeline refunds due to a settlement on pipeline rates from prior periods, and\n\u2022a net increase of $67 million related to sales to third parties, of which $81 million was due to an increase in the average cost of gas, partially offset by a decrease of $14 million due to lower volumes sold.\nOperation and Maintenance increased $19 million due primarily to a refueling outage in 2021 at our 100%-owned Hope Creek nuclear plant as compared to an outage in 2020 at our 57%-owned Salem 2 nuclear plant and severance costs related to the sale of the fossil generating plants, partially offset by lower costs in 2021 due to the sale of our ownership interest in the solar plants in June 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization decreased $112 million due primarily to ceasing depreciation expense on the fossil generating plants, the sale of the solar plants and the retirement of BH3 in 2021.\n(Gains) Losses on Asset Dispositions and Impairments. The loss in 2021 primarily reflects a $2,691 million impairment due to the sale of the fossil generating plants and other impairments, partially offset by a $63 million gain from the sale of the solar plants. The $122 million gain in 2020 was due to the sale of our ownership interest in the Yards Creek generation facility. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments.\nNet Gains (Losses) on Trust Investments decreased $54 million due primarily to a $101 million decrease in net unrealized gains on equity investments in the NDT Fund, partially offset by a $46 million increase in net realized gains on NDT Fund investments.\nOther Income (Deductions) increased $17 million due primarily to less purchases of NOL tax benefits under the New Jersey Technology Tax Benefit Transfer Program and higher interest and dividend income on NDT Fund investments in 2021.\nNon-Operating Pension and OPEB Credits (Costs) increased $14 million due to a decrease in interest cost and an increase in the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of net prior service cost.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt represents a loss incurred in 2021 for a make whole premium that was payable upon early redemption of all outstanding debt obligations and other non-cash debt extinguishment costs.\nInterest Expense decreased $43 million due primarily to the early redemption of all remaining outstanding Senior Notes in October 2021.\nIncome Tax Expense decreased $940 million due primarily to lower pre-tax income in 2021, partially offset by the recapture of ITCs related to the sale of the solar plants in 2021, the tax benefit in 2020 from changes in uncertain tax positions as a result of the settlement of the 2011-2016 federal income tax audits, and the purchase of less New Jersey NOL tax benefits in 2021.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019\nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.\nFinancing Methodology\nWe expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.\nPSE&G's sources of external liquidity include a $600 million multi-year revolving credit facility. PSE&G uses internally generated cash flow and its commercial paper program to meet seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. PSE&G does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending arrangements. PSE&G maintains back-up facilities in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. PSE&G's dividend payments to/capital contributions from PSEG are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. PSE&G's long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. Generally, PSE&G uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.\nPSEG, PSEG Power, Energy Holdings, PSEG LI and Services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs, which are accounted for as intercompany loans. Servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. Servco's short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by LIPA.\nPSEG's available sources of external liquidity may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and the incurrence of additional indebtedness under credit facilities. Our current sources of external liquidity include multi-year revolving credit facilities totaling $1.5 billion. These facilities are available to back-stop PSEG's commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. PSEG's credit facilities and the commercial paper program are available to support PSEG's working capital needs and are also available to make equity contributions or provide liquidity support to its subsidiaries. Additionally, from time to time, PSEG enters into short-term loan agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position.\nPSEG Power's sources of external liquidity include $1.9 billion of multi-year revolving credit facilities. Credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of PSEG Power's forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts as the\nmarket prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event that PSEG Power is downgraded to below investment grade by Standard & Poor's (S&P) or Moody's. PSEG Power's dividend payments to PSEG are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility.\nOperating Cash Flows\nWe continue to expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures and shareholder dividends.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our operating cash flow decreased $1,366 million. The net decrease was primarily due to a $780 million reduction related to net cash collateral posting requirements at PSEG Power and a net change at PSE&G, as discussed below. In addition, in 2021, there were higher tax payments at PSEG Power and lower tax refunds at the parent company, partially offset by lower tax payments at Energy Holdings.\nCurrent economic conditions have adversely impacted residential and C&I customer payment patterns. During the moratorium, as previously discussed, PSE&G has experienced a significant decrease in cash inflow and higher Accounts Receivable aging and an associated increase in bad debt expense, which we expect will extend beyond the duration of the coronavirus pandemic.\nPSE&G\nPSE&G's operating cash flow decreased $229 million from $1,953 million to $1,724 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, due primarily to a net increase in regulatory deferrals, increases in electric energy and vendor payments, and higher tax payments in 2021, partially offset by higher earnings.\nShort-Term Liquidity\nPSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of PSEG Power, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and, from time to time, short-term loans. PSE&G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facilities.\nWe continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements. Each of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries' liquidity needs.\nAs part of the generation business, we hedge generation output to mitigate market price volatility. When prices increase, hedged positions could be out-of-the-money, requiring margin postings. In times of significantly rising market prices, those collateral postings could be substantial. During the second half of 2021, PSEG Power experienced a substantial increase in net cash collateral postings related to hedge positions that are out-of-the-money due to an increase in energy market prices, from $343 million at the end of June to $844 million at the end of December. PSEG issued short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, in order to satisfy the increase in collateral postings and to prepare for the PSEG Power debt redemption. In October, PSEG Power borrowed $755 million from its credit facility to support its Senior Notes redemption and additional cash collateral postings, as needed. In November, PSEG issued $1.5 billion of Senior Notes, using a portion of the funds to provide support to PSEG Power for paying off the $755 million loan from the credit facility.\nIn March 2020, PSEG entered into a $300 million, 364-day term loan agreement which was prepaid in January 2021. In March and May 2021, PSEG entered into two 364-day variable rate term loan agreements for $500 million and $750 million, respectively. In August 2021, PSEG entered into a $1.25 billion, 364-day variable rate term loan agreement. These term loans are not included in the credit facility amounts presented in the following table.\nOur total credit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Company/Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total\nFacility </td> <td> </td> <td>Usage </td> <td> </td> <td>Available\nLiquidity </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Millions </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSE&G </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Power </td> <td> </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information, see Item 8. Note 16. Debt and Credit Facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our credit facility capacity was in excess of our projected maximum liquidity requirements over our 12 month planning horizon, including access to external financing to meet redemptions. Our maximum liquidity requirements are based on stress scenarios that incorporate changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of PSEG Power losing its investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody's, which would represent a two level downgrade from its current Moody's and S&P ratings. In the event of a deterioration of PSEG Power's credit rating, certain of PSEG Power's agreements allow the counterparty to demand further performance assurance. The potential additional collateral that we would be required to post under these agreements if PSEG Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating was approximately $1,151 million and $840 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Item 8. Note 15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities for additional discussion of PSEG Power's agreements.\nLong-Term Debt Financing\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 PSEG:\n\u2022issued $750 million of 0.84% Senior Notes due November 2023,\n\u2022issued $750 million of 2.45% Senior Notes due November 2031, and\n\u2022retired $300 million of 2.00% Senior Notes at maturity.\nIn October 2021, PSEG redeemed all remaining outstanding Senior Notes of PSEG Power due to covenants that could trigger a default from the sale of PSEG Power's fossil generating plants. This included $700 million of 3.85% Senior Notes due to mature in June 2023, $250 million of 4.30% Senior Notes due to mature in November 2023, and $404 million of 8.63% Senior Notes due to mature in April 2031. These Senior Notes were redeemed at a redemption price that included a \"make-whole\" premium of approximately $294 million plus any interest accrued and unpaid to the redemption date, in each case, calculated in accordance with the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The debt redemption and make-whole\u201d premium were funded with a short-term loan from PSEG and borrowings under PSEG Power's credit facility. In addition, approximately $4 million of other non-cash debt extinguishment costs related to the redemption were recorded in October 2021.\nDuring the next twelve months,\n\u2022PSEG has $700 million of 2.65% Senior Notes maturing in November 2022.\nFor additional information, see Item 8. Note 16. Debt and Credit Facilities.\nDebt Covenants\nOur credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.\nIn addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2021, PSE&G's Mortgage coverage ratio was 4.7 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $8.4 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.\nDefault Provisions\nOur bank credit agreements and indentures contain various, customary default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of indebtedness under the defaulting company's agreement.\nIn particular, PSEG's bank credit agreements contain provisions under which certain events, including an acceleration of material indebtedness under PSE&G's and PSEG Power's respective financing agreements, a failure by PSE&G or PSEG Power to satisfy certain final judgments and certain bankruptcy events by PSE&G or PSEG Power, would constitute an event of default under the PSEG bank credit agreements. Under the PSEG bank credit agreements, it would also be an event of default if either PSE&G or PSEG Power ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. The PSE&G and PSEG Power bank credit agreements include similar default provisions; however, such provisions only relate to the respective borrower under such agreement and its subsidiaries and do not contain cross default provisions to each other. The PSE&G and PSEG Power bank credit agreements do not include cross default provisions relating to PSEG. PSEG Power's bank credit agreements also contain limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt and liens.\nThere are no cross-acceleration provisions in PSEG's or PSE&G's indentures. However, PSEG's existing notes include a cross acceleration provision that may be triggered upon the acceleration of more than $75 million of indebtedness incurred by PSEG. Such provision does not extend to an acceleration of indebtedness by any of PSEG's subsidiaries.\nIn March 2021, each of PSEG and PSEG Power and its subsidiaries received waivers from the lenders and the administrative agent under their existing credit agreements permitting them to divest, in one or more transactions, some or all of its and its subsidiaries' non-nuclear assets without breaching the terms of the agreements.\nRatings Triggers\nOur debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material ratings triggers\u201d that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. In the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.\nIn accordance with BPU requirements under the BGS contracts, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers.\nFluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of PSEG Power's credit rating to below investment grade could increase PSEG Power's required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. PSEG Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would likely result from a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade by S&P or Moody's at today's market prices.\nCommon Stock Dividends\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Dividend Payments on Common Stock </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Per Share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.04 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.88 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>in Millions </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 15, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $0.54 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2022. This reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of $2.16 per share. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. For additional information related to cash dividends on our common stock, see Item 8. Note 24. Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Dividends.\nCredit Ratings\nIf the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital. Credit Ratings shown are for securities that we typically issue. Outlooks are shown for the credit ratings at each entity and can be Stable, Negative, or Positive. In May 2021, Moody's changed PSE&G's outlook to Negative from Stable. In August 2021, Moody's changed PSEG and PSEG Power's outlook to Negative from Stable. In October 2021, Moody's downgraded PSEG's senior unsecured notes rating to Baa2 from Baa1, PSE&G's mortgage bond rating to A1 from Aa3 and commercial paper rating to P2 from P1, and assigned PSEG Power an Issuer Credit Rating of Baa2. Moody's outlooks of PSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power were changed to Stable from Negative. With the redemption of PSEG Power's Senior Notes, S&P maintains an Issuer Credit Rating of BBB. There is no assurance that the ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be revised by the rating agencies, if in their respective judgments, circumstances warrant. Each rating given by an agency should be evaluated independently of the other agencies' ratings. The ratings should not be construed as an indication to buy, hold or sell any security.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Moody's (A) </td> <td> </td> <td>S&P (B) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Senior Notes </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Commercial Paper </td> <td>P2 </td> <td> </td> <td>A2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSE&G </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Mortgage Bonds </td> <td>A1 </td> <td> </td> <td>A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Commercial Paper </td> <td>P2 </td> <td> </td> <td>A2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Power </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Issuer Rating </td> <td>Baa2 </td> <td> </td> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A)Moody's ratings range from Aaa (highest) to C (lowest) for long-term securities and P1 (highest) to NP (lowest) for short-term securities.\n(B)S&P ratings range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest) for long-term securities and A1 (highest) to D (lowest) for short-term securities.\nOther Comprehensive Income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had Other Comprehensive Income of $154 million on a consolidated basis. The Other Comprehensive Income was due primarily to an increase of $190 million related to pension and other postretirement benefits, and $3 million of unrealized gains on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges, partially offset by $39 million of net unrealized losses related to Available-for-Sale Debt Securities. See Item 8. Note 23. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax for additional information.\nCAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nWe expect that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. Projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the following table. These projections include AFUDC for PSE&G and Interest Capitalized During Construction for PSEG's other subsidiaries. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. Amounts shown below for PSE&G include currently approved programs. We intend to continue to invest in infrastructure modernization and will seek to extend these and related programs as appropriate.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Millions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSE&G: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Transmission </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Electric Distribution </td> <td> </td> <td>840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Gas Distribution </td> <td> </td> <td>940 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Clean Energy </td> <td> </td> <td>275 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total PSE&G </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,465 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,530 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total PSEG </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPSE&G\nPSE&G's projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its T&D systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. As project scope and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. PSE&G's projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:\n\u2022Transmission-investments focused on reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure.\n\u2022Electric and Gas Distribution-investments for new business, reliability improvements, flood mitigation, and modernization and replacement of equipment that has reached the end of its useful life.\n\u2022Clean Energy-investments associated with customer energy efficiency programs, infrastructure supporting electric vehicles and grid-connected solar.\nIn 2021, PSE&G made $2,447 million of capital expenditures, primarily for T&D system reliability. This does not include expenditures for cost of removal, net of salvage, of $121 million, which are included in operating cash flows.\nOther\nPSEG's other projected expenditures are primarily comprised of investments to replace major parts and enhance operational performance at PSEG Power.\nIn 2021, PSEG's other capital expenditures were $115 million, excluding $157 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various nuclear projects at PSEG Power.\nOffshore Wind\nThe above table does not reflect our expected long-term investments in offshore wind projects. We currently expect to make investments in our 25% equity interest in Orsted's Ocean Wind project to fund construction and operations planning activities. Over the course of the project, which is expected to achieve full commercial operation in 2025, our investments are expected to be substantial. We have planned funding of approximately $250 million to support continued project development to its final investment decision. At that time, if we choose not to proceed with the project, Orsted has the option to repurchase our 25% equity interest in order to proceed with the project.\nOther Material Cash Requirements\nThe following table reflects our other material cash requirements which include debt maturities and interest payments, operating lease payments and energy related purchase commitments in the respective periods in which they are due. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 16. Debt and Credit Facilities, Note 8. Leases and Note 15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\nThe table below does not reflect any anticipated cash payments for pension and OPEB or asset retirement obligations due to uncertain timing of payments. See Item 8. Note 14. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) and Savings Plans and Note 13.

Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.\nAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)\nThe market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension and OPEB plans is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. The plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Plan assets also include investments in unlisted real estate which is valued via third-party appraisals. We calculate pension and OPEB costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.\nAssumptions and Approach Used: Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on trust assets. Demographic pension and OPEB assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns, as well as projected health care costs for OPEB.\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>2.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>7.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>OPEB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>2.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>7.69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.79 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe discount rate used to calculate pension and OPEB obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, our measurement date. The discount rate is determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high quality corporate bonds with similar maturities to the plan obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated plan distributions. The discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same result as the full spot rate curve.\nOur expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class, long-term inflation assumptions and a premium for active management.\nWe utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported costs/credits. The corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of the costs/credits. This occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. For the Pension Plan, the excess would be amortized over the average remaining expected life of inactive participants, which is approximately nineteen years. For Pension Plan II, the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees, which is approximately fourteen years.\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used: As part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming a 7.20% expected rate of return and a 2.94% discount rate for 2022 pension costs/credits and a 2.82% discount rate for 2022 OPEB costs/credits. Based upon these assumptions, we have estimated a net periodic pension credit in 2022 of approximately $115 million, or $172 million, net of amounts capitalized, and a net periodic OPEB credit in 2022 of approximately $124 million, or $127 million, net of amounts capitalized. Actual future pension costs/credits and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Actual future OPEB costs/credits will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, and various other factors.\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions. The effects of the assumption changes shown below solely reflect the impact of that specific assumption.\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on Benefit Obligation as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase to Costs in 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase to Costs, net of Amounts Capitalized in 2022 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Assumption </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Millions </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Pension </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>OPEB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Discount Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) and Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThis combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) and Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf.\nPSEG's business consists of two reportable segments, PSE&G and PSEG Power LLC (PSEG Power), our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:\n\u2022PSE&G-which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and\n\u2022PSEG Power-which is a multi-regional energy supply company that integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. PSEG Power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states in which they operate. PSEG Power is no longer a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant; however, it continues to be consolidated and reported in PSEG's financial statements as a wholly owned subsidiary and operating segment.\nIn August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 megawatts (MW) fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. As a result, disclosures in this Item 7 and elsewhere in this document that relate solely to this 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio, except for those related to certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale transactions, primarily for obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the Connecticut Transfer Act, are no longer relevant to our business.\nPSEG's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which holds our investments in offshore wind ventures and legacy portfolio of lease investments; PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement (OSA); and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\nOur business discussion in Item 1. Business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2021 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\nFor a discussion of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2020 Annual Report) as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2021 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\nWe are progressing on our strategy to become a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a contracted carbon-free energy infrastructure company. We are focused on meeting customer expectations and being well aligned with public policy objectives by investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability, increase energy efficiency and deliver cleaner energy. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth while controlling costs and managing the risks associated with regulatory and policy changes and fluctuating commodity prices. In furtherance of these goals, over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G, which improves\nthe sustainability and predictability of our earnings and cash flows. In June 2021, we completed the sale of PSEG Power's solar portfolio and in August 2021 we entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 MW of fossil generation located in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Maryland. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generation portfolio, which represented an important milestone in our strategy and has further altered our business mix, resulting in an even higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G going forward and provides more financial flexibility. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nPSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG LI are providing essential services during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We have implemented a comprehensive set of enhanced safety actions to help protect our employees, customers and communities, and we will continue to closely monitor developments and adjust as needed to ensure that we provide reliable service while protecting the safety and health of our workforce and the communities we serve. We continue to be guided by the recommendations of health authorities at the federal, state and local levels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated government actions and economic effects continue to impact our businesses. We have incurred additional expenses to protect our employees and customers, and PSE&G is experiencing significantly higher customer bad debts and lower cash collections, as discussed below. The potential future impact of the pandemic and the associated economic impacts, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic, will depend on a number of factors outside of our control. These include the duration and severity of the outbreaks as well as third-party actions taken to contain their spread and mitigate their public health effects, and governmental or regulatory actions regarding customer collections, potential limitations on rate increases, recovery of incremental costs, and other matters. While we currently cannot estimate the potential impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, this MD&A includes a discussion of potential effects of a prolonged outbreak.\nPSE&G\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on enhancing reliability and resiliency of our T&D system, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy programs. For the years 2021-2025, PSE&G's capital investment program is estimated to be in a range of $14 billion to $16 billion, resulting in an expected compound annual growth in rate base of 6.5% to 8%. The low end of the range assumes an extension of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) and Clean Energy Future (CEF)-Energy Efficiency (EE) program at their average annual investment levels, as these programs are expected to continue at least at those current rates beyond their currently approved timeframe of 2023. The upper end of the range is driven by certain unapproved investment programs, including an Infrastructure Advancement Program (IAP) which we filed in November 2021. The IAP is a proposed $848 million investment program made over four years to improve the reliability of the last mile\u201d of our electric distribution system, address aging substations and gas metering and regulating stations and invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure at our facilities to support the electrification of our fleet over the coming years. The upper end of the range also includes an extension of our Energy Strong program, which otherwise concludes in 2023, as well as the remaining portion of our CEF proposal (portion of Electric Vehicle (EV) and Energy Storage (ES) programs) and a potentially higher amount of investment for GSMP and CEF-EE beyond current levels. During 2022, we expect to file for extensions of our GSMP and CEF-EE program, which we expect will conclude in the first half of 2023.\nIn September 2020, PSE&G reached a settlement with parties in the CEF-EE proceeding, which the BPU approved. The settlement commits $1 billion over a three-year period, with the majority of the investment occurring over a five-year period. Costs will be recovered through annual rate-making, with returns aligned with our most recent base rate case and a ten-year amortization period.\nThe approval also included a Conservation Incentive Program (CIP), a mechanism that provides for recovery of lost electric and gas variable margin revenues relative to a baseline of the test year (July 2017 to June 2018) set in in our last base rate case. The deferral period for this mechanism became effective in June 2021 for electric and October 2021 for gas. PSE&G suspended its gas Weather Normalization Charge (WNC) when the gas CIP began.\nIn January 2021, the BPU approved a settlement with PSE&G and other parties in the CEF-Energy Cloud (EC) proceeding. The capital cost of the program, which is driven by the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), is estimated to be $707 million, invested over the next four years.\nAlso in January 2021, the BPU approved a settlement with PSE&G and other parties in the CEF-EV proceeding for a majority of the components of the program. The approved investment under the program is for approximately $166 million, primarily relating to preparatory work to deliver infrastructure to the charging point for three programs: residential smart charging; Level-2 mixed use charging; and direct current fast charging. A remaining component of our program related to medium and heavy duty charging infrastructure was the subject of a stakeholder process at the BPU in 2021. We currently anticipate that this effort will conclude with PSE&G submitting a filing in mid-year 2022 targeting infrastructure investments for the medium and heavy duty EV market.\nAll of the capital costs and expenses of the CEF-EC and CEF-EV programs are expected to be recovered in PSE&G's next base rate case, expected to be filed with the BPU by the end of 2023. From the start of the program until the commencement of new base rates, the return on and of the capital portion of each of these programs, as well as expenses incurred to implement the CEF-EV program and operating costs and stranded costs associated with the retirement of existing meters under the CEF-EC program, will be included for recovery as part of our next rate case expected to be concluded in the second half of 2024. Our CEF-ES program is being held in abeyance pending future policy guidance from the BPU.\nWe also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure in order to (i) maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, (ii) ensure system resilience in the face of continued extreme weather conditions and cyber and physical security threats, (iii) address an aging transmission infrastructure, (iv) leverage technology to improve the operation of the system, (v) reduce transmission constraints, (vi) meet changing customer usage patterns and the demand for 24/7 electricity, and (vii) satisfy state public policy goals, including aggressive decarbonization agendas. As part of a solicitation by the BPU, we also proposed two transmission projects to support the development of offshore wind which are being evaluated by the BPU and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), with project awards expected in late 2022. As discussed further below, in October 2021, FERC approved PSE&G's settlement with the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (New Jersey Rate Counsel) regarding several amendments to our transmission formula rate, including the reduction of its base transmission return on equity (ROE) from 11.18% to 9.9%. Under current FERC rules, we continue to earn a 50 basis point adder to that base ROE for our membership in PJM.\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated impacts could have several negative consequences, including potential delays of our regulatory agencies' review and approval of proposed programs or rate recovery.\nThe coronavirus has also impacted PSE&G's sales, with a reduction in demand from its commercial and industrial (C&I) customers, largely offset by increases in residential sales volumes. As a result, there has been no substantive net margin impact and changes are now largely addressed through the CIP mechanism that became effective in 2021. The most substantive impact of the pandemic on our financial position has been adverse changes to residential and C&I payment patterns. The State of New Jersey issued an Executive Order in March 2020 that included a moratorium on non-safety related service disconnections for non-payment. On June 30, 2021, the moratorium imposed by the State of New Jersey ended but the State had established a grace period\u201d prohibiting disconnections for residential customers through December 31, 2021. On January 22, 2022, the State extended the grace period to March 15, 2022. Consequently, collections and shut-offs will not be in full effect until mid-March 2022. During the moratorium, PSE&G has experienced a significant decrease in cash inflow and higher Accounts Receivable aging and an associated increase in bad debt expense, which we expect will continue through the grace period and winter moratorium and take the next several years to fully return to normal levels. Since the start of the pandemic, PSE&G's allowance for credit losses has increased by approximately $265 million. PSE&G's electric distribution bad debt expense is recoverable through its Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) mechanism. PSE&G has deferred its incremental gas distribution bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19 as a Regulatory Asset and will seek recovery of that cost, as well as other net incremental COVID-19 costs, in its next base rate case. Collection efforts with C&I customers recommenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and residential customer collection efforts will recommence in March 2022, with a focus on enrolling customers in payment support programs. Any further moratoriums on shut-offs or collection processes could have a material effect on our cash flows, and, to the extent not fully recovered through a rate-making process, on our financial results and condition.\nIn July 2020, the BPU authorized regulated utilities in New Jersey, including PSE&G, to create a COVID-19-related Regulatory Asset by deferring on their books and records prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 through September 30, 2021 for recovery in a future rate case. In September 2021, the BPU extended the authorization to defer such costs through December 31, 2022. Deferred costs are to be offset by any federal or state assistance that the utility may receive as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, PSE&G has recorded a Regulatory Asset related to COVID-19 to defer incremental costs of $116 million, which PSEG believes are recoverable under the BPU Order.\nPSEG Power\nIn July 2020, we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's non-nuclear generating fleet with the intention of accelerating the transformation of our business into a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility, with a significantly contracted generation business. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nIn May 2021, PSEG Power Ventures LLC (Power Ventures), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG Power, entered into a purchase agreement with Quattro Solar, LLC, an affiliate of LS Power, relating to the sale by Power Ventures of 100% of its ownership interest in PSEG Solar Source LLC (Solar Source) including its related assets and liabilities. The transaction closed in June 2021.\nIn August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In\nFebruary 2022, PSEG completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. These transformative transactions are expected to reduce overall business risk and earnings volatility, improve PSEG's financial flexibility and are consistent with PSEG's climate strategy and sustainability efforts, which are to focus on clean energy investments, methane reduction, and the transition to carbon-free generation. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nWe have sought to achieve operational excellence and manage costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. During 2021, our natural gas and nuclear units generated 22.5 and 31.2 terawatt hours and operated at a capacity factor of 49.1% and 91.9%, respectively. PSEG Power's hedging practices help to manage some of the volatility of the merchant power business. More than 90% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2022 from the expected remaining generation assets after the sale of the fossil generation portfolio relates to hedging of our energy margin, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms, Zero Emission Certificate (ZEC) revenues and, certain gas operations and ancillary service payments such as reactive power. While this limits our exposure to decreasing prices, our ability to realize benefits from rising market prices is also limited. As a result of significantly rising energy prices, as experienced during the second half of 2021, PSEG Power experienced a substantial increase in net cash collateral postings related to hedge positions that are out-of-the-money. As of December 31, 2021, net cash collateral postings were $844 million.\nAs discussed further below under Wholesale Power Market Design,\u201d in July 2021, PJM submitted to FERC a proposal to replace the current Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR), which applies to both new and existing resources that receive out-of-market payments, with new provisions that accommodate state public policy programs that do not attempt to set the price of capacity. Under the PJM proposal, PSEG Power's New Jersey nuclear plants that receive ZEC payments would not be subject to the MOPR. PJM's proposal requested that FERC approve the new provisions for the next Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) auction. In September 2021, FERC issued a notice that it was not able to act on PJM's proposed changes to the MOPR because of a split among the Commissioners on the lawfulness of the proposal. Therefore, PJM's rules became automatically effective as of September 29, 2021 and will apply to the next base residual auction. In February, FERC approved PJM's filing requesting that the auction be held in June 2022.\nPSEG LI\nFollowing the effects of Tropical Storm Isaias, the New York Attorney General (AG) initiated an inquiry into PSEG LI's preparation and response to the storm. In addition, the Department of Public Service (DPS) within the New York State Public Service Commission launched an investigation of the State's electric service providers', including PSEG LI's, preparation and response to the storm. The DPS issued an interim storm investigation report finding that PSEG LI violated its Emergency Response Plan and DPS Regulations, and recommended that LIPA consider taking various actions, including terminating or renegotiating the OSA. LIPA also issued a report with recommendations for improvements to PSEG LI's structure and processes and recommended that LIPA either renegotiate or terminate the OSA.\nIn December 2020, LIPA filed a complaint against PSEG LI in New York State court alleging multiple breaches of the OSA in connection with PSEG LI's preparation for and response to Tropical Storm Isaias seeking specific performance and $70 million in damages. In June 2021, LIPA and PSEG LI executed a non-binding term sheet, which includes several changes to the OSA, including shifting a portion of our fixed revenues to incentive compensation and subjecting a portion of revenue to the potential imposition of penalties by the DPS due to certain performance failures by PSEG LI, and resolves all of LIPA's claims related to Tropical Storm Isaias and the DPS investigation. An amended OSA based on the term sheet was agreed to by the parties and approved by the LIPA Board in December 2021. In January 2022, the New York AG approved the Amended OSA and it has been submitted to the New York Comptroller for approval, which approval must occur by April 1, 2022 (such date is subject to amendment by mutual agreement of PSEG LI and LIPA) in order for the Amended OSA to become binding and effective. Such approval would result in retroactive effectiveness to January 1, 2022 for purposes of compensation. The OSA contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend for five years. No assurances can be given regarding obtaining the New York Comptroller approval and the closing of the inquiry by the AG.\nIn the event that the Amended OSA is not approved by the New York Comptroller by April 1, 2022, PSEG LI intends to vigorously defend itself with regard to the allegations in LIPA's complaint alleging breaches of the OSA. A decision in this proceeding requiring specific performance or the payment of damages by PSEG LI or resulting in the termination of the OSA could have a material adverse effect on PSEG's results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate Strategy and Sustainability Efforts\nFor more than a century, our mission has been to provide safe access to an around-the-clock supply of reliable, affordable energy. Building on this mission, we are working toward a future where customers universally use less energy, the energy they use is cleaner, and its delivery is safe, more reliable and more resilient. In June 2021, we accelerated and expanded our net zero vision by 20 years, establishing a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 goal that includes direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) at both PSEG Power and PSE&G (covering our electric and\nnatural gas utility operations), assuming advances in technology, public policy and customer behavior. Scope 1 emissions include power generation, methane leaks, vehicle fleet emissions, sulfur hexafluoride and refrigerant leaks. Scope 2 emissions include both gas and electric purchased energy for our PSE&G facilities and line losses. In September 2021, we also committed to the United Nations-backed Race to Zero campaign. We have agreed to develop and submit science-based emission reduction targets following the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative by September 2023. Targets will encompass Scopes 1, 2, and 3 (which includes downstream/customer use of energy products as well as purchased goods and services for our own operations) and must be in line with 1.5oC emissions scenarios.\nPSE&G has undertaken a number of initiatives that support the reduction of GHG emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives. PSE&G's recently approved CEF-EE, CEF-EC and CEF-EV programs and the proposed CEF-ES program are intended to support New Jersey's Energy Master Plan through programs designed to help customers increase their energy efficiency, support the expansion of the EV infrastructure in the State, install energy storage capacity to supplement solar generation and enhance grid resiliency, install smart meters and supporting infrastructure to allow for the integration of other clean energy technologies and to more efficiently respond to weather and other outage events.\nIn addition, PSE&G is committed to the safe delivery of natural gas to almost two million customers throughout New Jersey and we are equally committed to reducing GHG emissions associated with such operations. The first phase of our GSMP replaced approximately 450 miles of cast-iron and unprotected steel gas main infrastructure, and the second phase of this program is expected to replace an additional 875 miles of gas pipes through 2023. The GSMP is designed to significantly reduce natural gas leaks in our distribution system, which would reduce the release of methane, a potent GHG, into the air. Through GSMP II, from 2018 through 2023 we expect to reduce methane leaks by approximately 22% system wide and assuming a continuation of GSMP, we expect to achieve an overall reduction in methane emissions of approximately 60% over the 2011 through 2030 period. As noted previously, later in 2022 we will file for an extension of GSMP which would continue and accelerate these methane reductions. We also continue to assess physical risks of climate change and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events, notably through our investments in our Energy Strong program. These investments have proven effective in recent severe weather events, including Tropical Storm Ida in August 2021, which brought significant flooding to our service territory but did not result in the loss of any of our electric distribution substations.\nWe also continue to focus on providing cleaner energy for our customers. Our priority is to preserve the economic viability of our nuclear units, which provide over 90% of the carbon-free energy in New Jersey, by advocating for state and federal policies that recognize the value of emission-free generation and reduce market risk. We also continue to explore investment opportunities in offshore wind, both generation and transmission to support the cost-efficient connection of offshore wind generation projects to the New Jersey electric system.\nOffshore Wind\nIn December 2020, PSEG entered into a definitive agreement with \u00d8rsted North America Inc. (\u00d8rsted) to acquire a 25% equity interest in \u00d8rsted's Ocean Wind project which is currently in development. Ocean Wind was selected by New Jersey to be the first offshore wind farm as part of the State's intention to add 7,500 MW of offshore wind generating capacity by 2035. The Ocean Wind project is expected to achieve full commercial operation in 2025. On March 31, 2021, the BPU approved PSEG's investment in Ocean Wind and the acquisition was completed in April 2021.\nAdditionally, PSEG and \u00d8rsted each owns 50% of Garden State Offshore Energy LLC (GSOE) which holds rights to an offshore wind lease area just south of New Jersey. In December 2021, the Maryland Public Service Commission awarded \u00d8rsted's 846 MW Skipjack 2 project Offshore Renewable Energy Credits under Maryland's second round of offshore wind solicitations. Skipjack 2 utilizes a portion of the GSOE lease area, and PSEG has an option to purchase 50% of Skipjack 2 and the previously awarded 120 MW Skipjack 1 project, which will be constructed concurrently. PSEG expects to determine whether to exercise this option during 2022. PSEG and \u00d8rsted are also exploring further opportunities to develop the remaining GSOE lease area.\nIn April 2021, PJM announced the opening of the first public policy Order 1000 bid window that would utilize the state agreement approach for transmission projects to support New Jersey's planned offshore wind generation. The state agreement approach requires customers in the requesting state - in this case New Jersey - to pay for the costs of these public policy transmission projects. In September 2021, PSEG and \u00d8rsted jointly submitted several proposals in response to the solicitation, including multi-spur options and an offshore network proposal. If awarded, the projects would be developed through a 50/50 joint venture with \u00d8rsted. The BPU has announced that it will select the winning proposals in the second half of 2022 with likely in-service dates by 2030.\nOperational Excellence\nWe emphasize excellence in operational performance while developing opportunities in both our regulated and competitive businesses. In 2021, our utility continued its efforts to control costs while maintaining strong operational performance.\nFinancial Strength\nOur financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during 2021 as we\n\u2022maintained sufficient liquidity,\n\u2022completed the sale of PSEG Power's Solar Source units and 6,750 MW of fossil generation assets,\n\u2022maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and\n\u2022increased our annual dividend for 2021 to $2.04 per share and our indicative annual dividend per share for 2022 to $2.16.\nIn late September 2021, we announced a $500 million share repurchase program to be implemented upon the close of the sale of the fossil generating assets. In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized senior management to implement a share repurchase program at such time as senior management deemed appropriate in its discretion, whether before or after the closing of the sale of the fossil generating assets. In December 2021, under this authorization, we entered into an open market share repurchase plan for $250 million of our common shares. There were no common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2021. During January and through February 16, 2022, we purchased the full $250 million of common shares under the open market share repurchase plan.\nWe expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources without the issuance of new equity. Our planned capital requirements, which are driven by growth in our regulated utility, and the sale of our fossil generating fleet enhances our business profile and underpins solid investment grade credit ratings with improved financial flexibility. In conjunction with the announced sale of our Fossil business, in October 2021 we redeemed all of PSEG Power's remaining debt. see Item 8. Note 16. Debt and Credit Facilities for additional details.\nFinancial Results\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThis combined MD&A is separately filed by Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) and Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G). Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf.\nPSEG's business consists of two reportable segments, PSE&G and PSEG Power LLC (PSEG Power), our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:\n\u2022PSE&G-which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and\n\u2022PSEG Power-which is a multi-regional energy supply company that integrates the operations of its merchant nuclear and fossil generating assets with its fuel supply functions through competitive energy sales in well-developed energy markets primarily in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic United States through its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. PSEG Power's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the states in which they operate. PSEG Power is no longer a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrant; however, it continues to be consolidated and reported in PSEG's financial statements as a wholly owned subsidiary and operating segment.\nIn August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 megawatts (MW) fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. As a result, disclosures in this Item 7 and elsewhere in this document that relate solely to this 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio, except for those related to certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale transactions, primarily for obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the Connecticut Transfer Act, are no longer relevant to our business.\nPSEG's other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which holds our investments in offshore wind ventures and legacy portfolio of lease investments; PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority's (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement (OSA); and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\nOur business discussion in Item 1. Business provides a review of the regions and markets where we operate and compete, as well as our strategy for conducting our businesses within these markets, focusing on operational excellence, financial strength and making disciplined investments. Our risk factor discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2021 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\nFor a discussion of 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (2020 Annual Report) as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2021.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2021 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\nWe are progressing on our strategy to become a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a contracted carbon-free energy infrastructure company. We are focused on meeting customer expectations and being well aligned with public policy objectives by investing to modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability, increase energy efficiency and deliver cleaner energy. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth while controlling costs and managing the risks associated with regulatory and policy changes and fluctuating commodity prices. In furtherance of these goals, over the past few years, our investments have altered our business mix to reflect a higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G, which improves\nthe sustainability and predictability of our earnings and cash flows. In June 2021, we completed the sale of PSEG Power's solar portfolio and in August 2021 we entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 MW of fossil generation located in New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and Maryland. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generation portfolio, which represented an important milestone in our strategy and has further altered our business mix, resulting in an even higher percentage of earnings contribution by PSE&G going forward and provides more financial flexibility. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nPSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG LI are providing essential services during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We have implemented a comprehensive set of enhanced safety actions to help protect our employees, customers and communities, and we will continue to closely monitor developments and adjust as needed to ensure that we provide reliable service while protecting the safety and health of our workforce and the communities we serve. We continue to be guided by the recommendations of health authorities at the federal, state and local levels.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated government actions and economic effects continue to impact our businesses. We have incurred additional expenses to protect our employees and customers, and PSE&G is experiencing significantly higher customer bad debts and lower cash collections, as discussed below. The potential future impact of the pandemic and the associated economic impacts, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic, will depend on a number of factors outside of our control. These include the duration and severity of the outbreaks as well as third-party actions taken to contain their spread and mitigate their public health effects, and governmental or regulatory actions regarding customer collections, potential limitations on rate increases, recovery of incremental costs, and other matters. While we currently cannot estimate the potential impact to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, this MD&A includes a discussion of potential effects of a prolonged outbreak.\nPSE&G\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on enhancing reliability and resiliency of our T&D system, meeting customer expectations and supporting public policy objectives by investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy programs. For the years 2021-2025, PSE&G's capital investment program is estimated to be in a range of $14 billion to $16 billion, resulting in an expected compound annual growth in rate base of 6.5% to 8%. The low end of the range assumes an extension of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) and Clean Energy Future (CEF)-Energy Efficiency (EE) program at their average annual investment levels, as these programs are expected to continue at least at those current rates beyond their currently approved timeframe of 2023. The upper end of the range is driven by certain unapproved investment programs, including an Infrastructure Advancement Program (IAP) which we filed in November 2021. The IAP is a proposed $848 million investment program made over four years to improve the reliability of the last mile\u201d of our electric distribution system, address aging substations and gas metering and regulating stations and invest in electric vehicle charging infrastructure at our facilities to support the electrification of our fleet over the coming years. The upper end of the range also includes an extension of our Energy Strong program, which otherwise concludes in 2023, as well as the remaining portion of our CEF proposal (portion of Electric Vehicle (EV) and Energy Storage (ES) programs) and a potentially higher amount of investment for GSMP and CEF-EE beyond current levels. During 2022, we expect to file for extensions of our GSMP and CEF-EE program, which we expect will conclude in the first half of 2023.\nIn September 2020, PSE&G reached a settlement with parties in the CEF-EE proceeding, which the BPU approved. The settlement commits $1 billion over a three-year period, with the majority of the investment occurring over a five-year period. Costs will be recovered through annual rate-making, with returns aligned with our most recent base rate case and a ten-year amortization period.\nThe approval also included a Conservation Incentive Program (CIP), a mechanism that provides for recovery of lost electric and gas variable margin revenues relative to a baseline of the test year (July 2017 to June 2018) set in in our last base rate case. The deferral period for this mechanism became effective in June 2021 for electric and October 2021 for gas. PSE&G suspended its gas Weather Normalization Charge (WNC) when the gas CIP began.\nIn January 2021, the BPU approved a settlement with PSE&G and other parties in the CEF-Energy Cloud (EC) proceeding. The capital cost of the program, which is driven by the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), is estimated to be $707 million, invested over the next four years.\nAlso in January 2021, the BPU approved a settlement with PSE&G and other parties in the CEF-EV proceeding for a majority of the components of the program. The approved investment under the program is for approximately $166 million, primarily relating to preparatory work to deliver infrastructure to the charging point for three programs: residential smart charging; Level-2 mixed use charging; and direct current fast charging. A remaining component of our program related to medium and heavy duty charging infrastructure was the subject of a stakeholder process at the BPU in 2021. We currently anticipate that this effort will conclude with PSE&G submitting a filing in mid-year 2022 targeting infrastructure investments for the medium and heavy duty EV market.\nAll of the capital costs and expenses of the CEF-EC and CEF-EV programs are expected to be recovered in PSE&G's next base rate case, expected to be filed with the BPU by the end of 2023. From the start of the program until the commencement of new base rates, the return on and of the capital portion of each of these programs, as well as expenses incurred to implement the CEF-EV program and operating costs and stranded costs associated with the retirement of existing meters under the CEF-EC program, will be included for recovery as part of our next rate case expected to be concluded in the second half of 2024. Our CEF-ES program is being held in abeyance pending future policy guidance from the BPU.\nWe also continue to invest in transmission infrastructure in order to (i) maintain and enhance system integrity and grid reliability, (ii) ensure system resilience in the face of continued extreme weather conditions and cyber and physical security threats, (iii) address an aging transmission infrastructure, (iv) leverage technology to improve the operation of the system, (v) reduce transmission constraints, (vi) meet changing customer usage patterns and the demand for 24/7 electricity, and (vii) satisfy state public policy goals, including aggressive decarbonization agendas. As part of a solicitation by the BPU, we also proposed two transmission projects to support the development of offshore wind which are being evaluated by the BPU and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), with project awards expected in late 2022. As discussed further below, in October 2021, FERC approved PSE&G's settlement with the BPU and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel (New Jersey Rate Counsel) regarding several amendments to our transmission formula rate, including the reduction of its base transmission return on equity (ROE) from 11.18% to 9.9%. Under current FERC rules, we continue to earn a 50 basis point adder to that base ROE for our membership in PJM.\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic and associated impacts could have several negative consequences, including potential delays of our regulatory agencies' review and approval of proposed programs or rate recovery.\nThe coronavirus has also impacted PSE&G's sales, with a reduction in demand from its commercial and industrial (C&I) customers, largely offset by increases in residential sales volumes. As a result, there has been no substantive net margin impact and changes are now largely addressed through the CIP mechanism that became effective in 2021. The most substantive impact of the pandemic on our financial position has been adverse changes to residential and C&I payment patterns. The State of New Jersey issued an Executive Order in March 2020 that included a moratorium on non-safety related service disconnections for non-payment. On June 30, 2021, the moratorium imposed by the State of New Jersey ended but the State had established a grace period\u201d prohibiting disconnections for residential customers through December 31, 2021. On January 22, 2022, the State extended the grace period to March 15, 2022. Consequently, collections and shut-offs will not be in full effect until mid-March 2022. During the moratorium, PSE&G has experienced a significant decrease in cash inflow and higher Accounts Receivable aging and an associated increase in bad debt expense, which we expect will continue through the grace period and winter moratorium and take the next several years to fully return to normal levels. Since the start of the pandemic, PSE&G's allowance for credit losses has increased by approximately $265 million. PSE&G's electric distribution bad debt expense is recoverable through its Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) mechanism. PSE&G has deferred its incremental gas distribution bad debt expense as a result of COVID-19 as a Regulatory Asset and will seek recovery of that cost, as well as other net incremental COVID-19 costs, in its next base rate case. Collection efforts with C&I customers recommenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and residential customer collection efforts will recommence in March 2022, with a focus on enrolling customers in payment support programs. Any further moratoriums on shut-offs or collection processes could have a material effect on our cash flows, and, to the extent not fully recovered through a rate-making process, on our financial results and condition.\nIn July 2020, the BPU authorized regulated utilities in New Jersey, including PSE&G, to create a COVID-19-related Regulatory Asset by deferring on their books and records prudently incurred incremental costs related to COVID-19 beginning on March 9, 2020 through September 30, 2021 for recovery in a future rate case. In September 2021, the BPU extended the authorization to defer such costs through December 31, 2022. Deferred costs are to be offset by any federal or state assistance that the utility may receive as a direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2021, PSE&G has recorded a Regulatory Asset related to COVID-19 to defer incremental costs of $116 million, which PSEG believes are recoverable under the BPU Order.\nPSEG Power\nIn July 2020, we announced that we were exploring strategic alternatives for PSEG Power's non-nuclear generating fleet with the intention of accelerating the transformation of our business into a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility, with a significantly contracted generation business. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nIn May 2021, PSEG Power Ventures LLC (Power Ventures), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG Power, entered into a purchase agreement with Quattro Solar, LLC, an affiliate of LS Power, relating to the sale by Power Ventures of 100% of its ownership interest in PSEG Solar Source LLC (Solar Source) including its related assets and liabilities. The transaction closed in June 2021.\nIn August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power's 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In\nFebruary 2022, PSEG completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. These transformative transactions are expected to reduce overall business risk and earnings volatility, improve PSEG's financial flexibility and are consistent with PSEG's climate strategy and sustainability efforts, which are to focus on clean energy investments, methane reduction, and the transition to carbon-free generation. See Item 8. Note 4. Early Plant Retirements/Asset Dispositions and Impairments for additional information.\nWe have sought to achieve operational excellence and manage costs in order to optimize cash flow generation from our fleet in light of low wholesale power and gas prices, environmental considerations and competitive market forces that reward efficiency and reliability. During 2021, our natural gas and nuclear units generated 22.5 and 31.2 terawatt hours and operated at a capacity factor of 49.1% and 91.9%, respectively. PSEG Power's hedging practices help to manage some of the volatility of the merchant power business. More than 90% of PSEG Power's expected gross margin in 2022 from the expected remaining generation assets after the sale of the fossil generation portfolio relates to hedging of our energy margin, our expected revenues from the capacity market mechanisms, Zero Emission Certificate (ZEC) revenues and, certain gas operations and ancillary service payments such as reactive power. While this limits our exposure to decreasing prices, our ability to realize benefits from rising market prices is also limited. As a result of significantly rising energy prices, as experienced during the second half of 2021, PSEG Power experienced a substantial increase in net cash collateral postings related to hedge positions that are out-of-the-money. As of December 31, 2021, net cash collateral postings were $844 million.\nAs discussed further below under Wholesale Power Market Design,\u201d in July 2021, PJM submitted to FERC a proposal to replace the current Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR), which applies to both new and existing resources that receive out-of-market payments, with new provisions that accommodate state public policy programs that do not attempt to set the price of capacity. Under the PJM proposal, PSEG Power's New Jersey nuclear plants that receive ZEC payments would not be subject to the MOPR. PJM's proposal requested that FERC approve the new provisions for the next Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) auction. In September 2021, FERC issued a notice that it was not able to act on PJM's proposed changes to the MOPR because of a split among the Commissioners on the lawfulness of the proposal. Therefore, PJM's rules became automatically effective as of September 29, 2021 and will apply to the next base residual auction. In February, FERC approved PJM's filing requesting that the auction be held in June 2022.\nPSEG LI\nFollowing the effects of Tropical Storm Isaias, the New York Attorney General (AG) initiated an inquiry into PSEG LI's preparation and response to the storm. In addition, the Department of Public Service (DPS) within the New York State Public Service Commission launched an investigation of the State's electric service providers', including PSEG LI's, preparation and response to the storm. The DPS issued an interim storm investigation report finding that PSEG LI violated its Emergency Response Plan and DPS Regulations, and recommended that LIPA consider taking various actions, including terminating or renegotiating the OSA. LIPA also issued a report with recommendations for improvements to PSEG LI's structure and processes and recommended that LIPA either renegotiate or terminate the OSA.\nIn December 2020, LIPA filed a complaint against PSEG LI in New York State court alleging multiple breaches of the OSA in connection with PSEG LI's preparation for and response to Tropical Storm Isaias seeking specific performance and $70 million in damages. In June 2021, LIPA and PSEG LI executed a non-binding term sheet, which includes several changes to the OSA, including shifting a portion of our fixed revenues to incentive compensation and subjecting a portion of revenue to the potential imposition of penalties by the DPS due to certain performance failures by PSEG LI, and resolves all of LIPA's claims related to Tropical Storm Isaias and the DPS investigation. An amended OSA based on the term sheet was agreed to by the parties and approved by the LIPA Board in December 2021. In January 2022, the New York AG approved the Amended OSA and it has been submitted to the New York Comptroller for approval, which approval must occur by April 1, 2022 (such date is subject to amendment by mutual agreement of PSEG LI and LIPA) in order for the Amended OSA to become binding and effective. Such approval would result in retroactive effectiveness to January 1, 2022 for purposes of compensation. The OSA contract term will continue through 2025, with a mutual option to extend for five years. No assurances can be given regarding obtaining the New York Comptroller approval and the closing of the inquiry by the AG.\nIn the event that the Amended OSA is not approved by the New York Comptroller by April 1, 2022, PSEG LI intends to vigorously defend itself with regard to the allegations in LIPA's complaint alleging breaches of the OSA. A decision in this proceeding requiring specific performance or the payment of damages by PSEG LI or resulting in the termination of the OSA could have a material adverse effect on PSEG's results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate Strategy and Sustainability Efforts\nFor more than a century, our mission has been to provide safe access to an around-the-clock supply of reliable, affordable energy. Building on this mission, we are working toward a future where customers universally use less energy, the energy they use is cleaner, and its delivery is safe, more reliable and more resilient. In June 2021, we accelerated and expanded our net zero vision by 20 years, establishing a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 goal that includes direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) at both PSEG Power and PSE&G (covering our electric and\nnatural gas utility operations), assuming advances in technology, public policy and customer behavior. Scope 1 emissions include power generation, methane leaks, vehicle fleet emissions, sulfur hexafluoride and refrigerant leaks. Scope 2 emissions include both gas and electric purchased energy for our PSE&G facilities and line losses. In September 2021, we also committed to the United Nations-backed Race to Zero campaign. We have agreed to develop and submit science-based emission reduction targets following the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative by September 2023. Targets will encompass Scopes 1, 2, and 3 (which includes downstream/customer use of energy products as well as purchased goods and services for our own operations) and must be in line with 1.5oC emissions scenarios.\nPSE&G has undertaken a number of initiatives that support the reduction of GHG emissions and the implementation of energy efficiency initiatives. PSE&G's recently approved CEF-EE, CEF-EC and CEF-EV programs and the proposed CEF-ES program are intended to support New Jersey's Energy Master Plan through programs designed to help customers increase their energy efficiency, support the expansion of the EV infrastructure in the State, install energy storage capacity to supplement solar generation and enhance grid resiliency, install smart meters and supporting infrastructure to allow for the integration of other clean energy technologies and to more efficiently respond to weather and other outage events.\nIn addition, PSE&G is committed to the safe delivery of natural gas to almost two million customers throughout New Jersey and we are equally committed to reducing GHG emissions associated with such operations. The first phase of our GSMP replaced approximately 450 miles of cast-iron and unprotected steel gas main infrastructure, and the second phase of this program is expected to replace an additional 875 miles of gas pipes through 2023. The GSMP is designed to significantly reduce natural gas leaks in our distribution system, which would reduce the release of methane, a potent GHG, into the air. Through GSMP II, from 2018 through 2023 we expect to reduce methane leaks by approximately 22% system wide and assuming a continuation of GSMP, we expect to achieve an overall reduction in methane emissions of approximately 60% over the 2011 through 2030 period. As noted previously, later in 2022 we will file for an extension of GSMP which would continue and accelerate these methane reductions. We also continue to assess physical risks of climate change and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events, notably through our investments in our Energy Strong program. These investments have proven effective in recent severe weather events, including Tropical Storm Ida in August 2021, which brought significant flooding to our service territory but did not result in the loss of any of our electric distribution substations.\nWe also continue to focus on providing cleaner energy for our customers. Our priority is to preserve the economic viability of our nuclear units, which provide over 90% of the carbon-free energy in New Jersey, by advocating for state and federal policies that recognize the value of emission-free generation and reduce market risk. We also continue to explore investment opportunities in offshore wind, both generation and transmission to support the cost-efficient connection of offshore wind generation projects to the New Jersey electric system.\nOffshore Wind\nIn December 2020, PSEG entered into a definitive agreement with \u00d8rsted North America Inc. (\u00d8rsted) to acquire a 25% equity interest in \u00d8rsted's Ocean Wind project which is currently in development. Ocean Wind was selected by New Jersey to be the first offshore wind farm as part of the State's intention to add 7,500 MW of offshore wind generating capacity by 2035. The Ocean Wind project is expected to achieve full commercial operation in 2025. On March 31, 2021, the BPU approved PSEG's investment in Ocean Wind and the acquisition was completed in April 2021.\nAdditionally, PSEG and \u00d8rsted each owns 50% of Garden State Offshore Energy LLC (GSOE) which holds rights to an offshore wind lease area just south of New Jersey. In December 2021, the Maryland Public Service Commission awarded \u00d8rsted's 846 MW Skipjack 2 project Offshore Renewable Energy Credits under Maryland's second round of offshore wind solicitations. Skipjack 2 utilizes a portion of the GSOE lease area, and PSEG has an option to purchase 50% of Skipjack 2 and the previously awarded 120 MW Skipjack 1 project, which will be constructed concurrently. PSEG expects to determine whether to exercise this option during 2022. PSEG and \u00d8rsted are also exploring further opportunities to develop the remaining GSOE lease area.\nIn April 2021, PJM announced the opening of the first public policy Order 1000 bid window that would utilize the state agreement approach for transmission projects to support New Jersey's planned offshore wind generation. The state agreement approach requires customers in the requesting state - in this case New Jersey - to pay for the costs of these public policy transmission projects. In September 2021, PSEG and \u00d8rsted jointly submitted several proposals in response to the solicitation, including multi-spur options and an offshore network proposal. If awarded, the projects would be developed through a 50/50 joint venture with \u00d8rsted. The BPU has announced that it will select the winning proposals in the second half of 2022 with likely in-service dates by 2030.\nOperational Excellence\nWe emphasize excellence in operational performance while developing opportunities in both our regulated and competitive businesses. In 2021, our utility continued its efforts to control costs while maintaining strong operational performance.\nFinancial Strength\nOur financial strength is predicated on a solid balance sheet, positive operating cash flow and reasonable risk-adjusted returns on increased investment. Our financial position remained strong during 2021 as we\n\u2022maintained sufficient liquidity,\n\u2022completed the sale of PSEG Power's Solar Source units and 6,750 MW of fossil generation assets,\n\u2022maintained solid investment grade credit ratings, and\n\u2022increased our annual dividend for 2021 to $2.04 per share and our indicative annual dividend per share for 2022 to $2.16.\nIn late September 2021, we announced a $500 million share repurchase program to be implemented upon the close of the sale of the fossil generating assets. In November 2021, our Board of Directors authorized senior management to implement a share repurchase program at such time as senior management deemed appropriate in its discretion, whether before or after the closing of the sale of the fossil generating assets. In December 2021, under this authorization, we entered into an open market share repurchase plan for $250 million of our common shares. There were no common share repurchases during the fourth quarter of 2021. During January and through February 16, 2022, we purchased the full $250 million of common shares under the open market share repurchase plan.\nWe expect to be able to fund our planned capital requirements, as described in Liquidity and Capital Resources without the issuance of new equity. Our planned capital requirements, which are driven by growth in our regulated utility, and the sale of our fossil generating fleet enhances our business profile and underpins solid investment grade credit ratings with improved financial flexibility. In conjunction with the announced sale of our Fossil business, in October 2021 we redeemed all of PSEG Power's remaining debt. see Item 8. Note 16. Debt and Credit Facilities for additional details.\nFinancial Results\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented as follows:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Millions, except per share data </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSE&G </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Power </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,056) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Net Income (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>PSEG Net"}
