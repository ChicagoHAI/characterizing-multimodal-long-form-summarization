MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is creating value through innovation. We were founded in 2008 with a mission of improving diagnostic accuracy. Today, our growing menu of tests leverage advances in genomic science and technology to improve care throughout the patient journey, enabling more confident diagnostic, prognostic and treatment decisions in cancer and other challenging diseases. We are creating new standards of care by enabling more patients to avoid risks of unnecessary invasive procedures and removing costs from the healthcare system, while speeding the time to diagnosis and treatment decisions.\nWe perform our genomic tests for thyroid cancer, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, in our CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California. In December 2019, we announced our acquisition from NanoString Technologies, Inc., or NanoString, of the exclusive global diagnostics license to the nCounter FLEX Analysis System, as well as the Prosigna breast cancer prognostic gene signature assay, which is commercially available, and the LymphMark lymphoma subtyping assay, which is in development. Both tests are designed for use on the nCounter system. We believe this strategic transaction positions us to expand our business globally with a broad menu of advanced genomic tests that may be offered as distributed kits and performed in local laboratories worldwide. We believe our current and pipeline products address a collective $40 billion global market.\nWe currently offer five commercialized genomic tests that are changing disease diagnosis and patient care. All five tests are available in the United States and one is available internationally. These include the Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier, or GSC (its predecessor was the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC) for thyroid cancer; the Percepta GSC (its predecessor was the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier) for lung cancer; the Envisia Genomic Classifier for IPF; the Afirma Xpression Atlas, which provides information on the most common and emerging gene alterations associated with thyroid cancer, enabling physicians to confidently tailor surgical and treatment decisions at time of diagnosis; and the Prosigna breast cancer test for assessing risk of distant recurrence, which is available for use on the nCounter platform in the United States and internationally.\nOur ability to leverage RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing data in large biorepositories of patient-consented samples in oncology and other indications presents an opportunity for biopharmaceutical companies to enhance their research and development capabilities. In April 2018, we announced a collaboration with Loxo Oncology (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company) to advance our development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer. In December 2018, we entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovation and the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson to advance the development and commercialization of novel diagnostic tests to detect lung cancer at its earliest stages, when the disease is most treatable. The collaboration builds upon foundational \"field of injury\" science where genomic changes associated with lung cancer can be identified with a simple brushing of a person's airway to develop new interventions that can save lives. Additionally, in January 2020, we announced an agreement with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development arm of AstraZeneca, to provide genomic information that will support its development of oncology therapeutics in lymphoma.\nPatients access our tests through their physician. Our Afirma, Percepta and Envisia tests are used as part of the diagnostic process and genomic testing services are performed in our CLIA laboratory located in San Francisco, California. Cytopathology services for Afirma testing are performed in our reference laboratory in Austin, Texas. The Prosigna test is indicated in female breast cancer patients who have undergone surgery in conjunction with locoregional treatment consistent with standard of care. This in vitro diagnostic test is performed on the nCounter Flex Analysis System in laboratories worldwide, as well as in the United States.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total Revenue was $29.7 million, an increase of 15%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross Margin was 66%, unchanged;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Expenses, Excluding Cost of Revenue, were $27.8 million, an increase of 38%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss was ($7.5) million, an increase of 140%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share was ($0.15), an increase of 88%;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $1.8 million, compared to $1.2 million used;

Factors impacting the number of tests that we report as completed include, but are not limited to:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of samples that we receive that meet the medical indication for each test performed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the quantity and quality of the sample received;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>receipt of the necessary documentation, such as physician order and patient consent, required to perform, bill and collect for our tests;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the patient's ability to pay or provide necessary insurance coverage for the tests performed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the time it takes us to perform our tests and report the results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the seasonality inherent in our business, such as the impact of work days per period, timing of industry conferences and the timing of when patient deductibles are exceeded, which also impacts the reimbursement we receive from insurers; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to obtain prior authorization or meet other requirements instituted by payers, benefit managers, or regulators necessary to be paid for our tests.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generate substantially all our revenue from genomic testing services, including the rendering of a cytopathology diagnosis as part of the Afirma solution. For the Afirma classifier, we do not accrue revenue for approximately 5% - 10% of the tests that we perform and report as complete due principally to insufficient RNA from which to render a result and tests performed for which we do not reasonably expect to be paid.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products\nRevenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. To drive increased adoption of our products, we increased our sales force and marketing efforts over the last several years. Our sales team is structured to sell all of our products; we do not maintain a separate sales force for each product. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates.\nIntegrating acquired assets and advances to our collaborations\nRevenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate the assets acquired into our existing business. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of operations, cause significant write-offs of intangible assets, or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. The integration of assets acquired from NanoString in December 2019 may\nimpact our revenue and operating results through integration of a sales force, development of a product supply operation and the expansion of our business internationally with a broad menu of advanced genomic tests that may be offered.\nRevenue growth or reimbursement from our collaborations depends on our ability to deliver services or information and achieve milestones required from our collaborative partners. Our collaboration parters pay us for the provision of data, other services and the achievement of milestones. Under a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson in 2018, we provided data services required under this agreement for $7.0 million in 2019, however, there remains $9.0 of revenue associated with development and commercialization milestones yet to be achieved.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nTesting Revenue\nWe commenced recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers starting January 1, 2018. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 954-605, Health Care Entities - Revenue Recognition.\nMost of our revenue is generated from the provision of diagnostic services. These services are completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician, at which time we bill for the services. We recognize revenue related to billings on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nAs of December 31, 2019, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled approximately $159.3 million. Of this amount, we did not collect any amounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 and we have no expectation of future collection because we began accruing for substantially all revenue upon delivery of a patient report in the third quarter of 2016.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests.\nWe bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect. Finally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed.\nGenerally, we calculate the average reimbursement from our products from all payers, for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus, the average reimbursement per product represents the total cash collected to date against genomic classifier tests, including variants, performed during the relevant period divided by the number of these tests performed during that same period.\nThe average genomic classifier reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued, on average, between $2,800 and $2,900 for the Afirma genomic classifier tests, including variants, that met our revenue recognition standard, which was between 90% - 95% of the reported Afirma classifier test volume.\nFrom the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we accrued between $1.0 million and $2.4 million in revenue per quarter from providing cytopathology services associated with our Afirma solution.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met.\nProduct Revenue\nWe began recognizing product revenue in December 2019 in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when we executed an agreement with NanoString for the exclusive worldwide license to the nCounter platform for in vitro diagnostic use.\nWe recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products and services. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product or service. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue.\nOur products consist of the nCounter Analysis System and related consumables. Services consist of instrument service contracts and service fees for assay processing. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Collaboration Revenues\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for research and development and/or commercialization services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or samples, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&D services, and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to us in the form of nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, royalty payments, and/or profit sharing.\nThe terms of the Company's collaborative arrangements typically include one or more of the following: (i) up-front fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of development, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments may result in collaboration revenues or an offset against research and development expense.\nArrangements with partners may fall under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d). While these arrangements are in the scope of ASC 808, we may analogize to ASC 606 for some aspects of these arrangements. We analogize to ASC 606 for certain activities within the collaborative arrangement for the delivery of a good or service (i.e., a unit of account) that is part of our ongoing major or central operations.\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods is transferred or services are performed. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should\nthere be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nNet sales of data or other services to our customers are classified under biopharmaceutical revenue and collaboration revenue, such as milestones, are classified under collaboration revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Payments made to us that are not net sales of data or other services to our customers are recorded as an offset against research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nDevelopment of Additional Tests\nWe continue to advance our portfolio of diagnostic tests that leverage innovations in genomic science, sequencing technology and machine learning methodologies to further improve patient care. In May 2017, we introduced the Afirma GSC, supported by rigorous clinical validation data showing that the RNA sequencing-based test can help significantly more patients avoid unnecessary surgery in thyroid cancer diagnosis, compared to the original Afirma classifier. In March 2018, we unveiled our Afirma Xpression Atlas, which uses the same RNA sequencing data from the platform as the Afirma GSC and enables us to extract rich genomic content - including gene expression, DNA variants and RNA fusions in over 500 genes that are associated with thyroid cancer - from thyroid FNA samples. We believe that this offering will provide clinicians with valuable genomic information that may inform surgery strategy and treatment options for patients with suspected thyroid cancer.\nTogether with our Afirma GSC and our tests for the BRAF v600E mutation and medullary thyroid cancer, or Malignancy Classifiers, the Afirma Xpression Atlas rounds out a comprehensive solution for physicians evaluating thyroid nodules. This innovation also enables us to enter into research collaboration with biopharmaceutical companies, which is intended to support their development of targeted therapies for genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer.\nWe have also expanded our ability to provide important clinical answers - without the need for surgery - into pulmonology. Our Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier, introduced in April 2015, is the first genomic test to receive Medicare coverage for use in lung cancer diagnosis, where it improves the performance of diagnostic bronchoscopy. In June 2019, we began making our next-generation\u201d Percepta Genomic Sequencing Classifier available to physicians, providing them with expanded lung cancer risk information that can further guide next steps for patients with suspicious lung nodules, as compared to the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier.\nAdditionally, our Envisia Genomic Classifier, launched in October 2016, is the first commercial test to improve the diagnosis of IPF among patients with a suspected interstitial lung disease. In March 2019, we received final Medicare coverage for the Envisia classifier through the MolDX program, with an effective date of April 1, 2019.\nWe also believe our Xpression Atlas platform can be transferred to our pulmonology indications, to further improve patient care and advance precision medicine in lung cancer and IPF.\nWe are currently exploring opportunities to utilize the same field of injury\u201d technology that powers our Percepta classifier to develop a nasal swab test that can enable earlier lung cancer detection - and ultimately help reduce lung cancer deaths. In October 2019, we announced preliminary clinical data showing for our noninvasive nasal swab classifier - the first test of its kind. The findings show that the novel genomic test can accurately classify lung cancer risk in patients with lung nodules so that these patients can obtain the prompt diagnosis and potential treatment they need or may be monitored noninvasively.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nTesting Revenue\nThrough December 31, 2019, we derived a substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of Afirma delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UnitedHealthcare\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods.\nCost of Testing Revenue\nThe components of our cost of revenue are laboratory expenses, kit costs, sample collection expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation and amortization, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, run quality control batches, test batches, registry samples and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and consumables from third-party contract manufacturers, installation, warranty, service and packaging and delivery costs. In addition, cost of product includes royalty costs for licensed technologies included in our products, provisions for slow-moving and obsolete inventory and stock-based compensation expense. Cost of product revenue for instruments and consumables is recognized in the period the related revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are included in cost of product in the consolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses include expenses incurred to develop our technology, collect clinical samples and conduct clinical studies to develop and support our products and pipeline. These expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct research and development expenses such as prototype materials, laboratory supplies and costs associated with setting up and\nconducting clinical studies at domestic and international sites, professional fees, depreciation and amortization, other miscellaneous expenses and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. We expense all research and development costs in the periods in which they are incurred. We expect to incur significant research and development expenses as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing additional products and evaluating various platforms. We incurred research and development expenses on ongoing evidence development for our Afirma, Percepta and Envisia classifiers in 2019 . We believe a majority of our research and development expenses in and after 2020 will be predominantly in support of our pipeline products.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of compensation expenses, direct marketing expenses, professional fees, other expenses such as travel and communications costs and allocation of facility and information technology expenses. We have expanded our internal sales force as we invest in our multi-product sales strategy to assign a single point of contact to successfully develop and implement relationships with our customers and increased our marketing spending. We have also incurred increased selling and marketing expense as a result of investments in our lung product portfolio and believe total selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we launch and promote our new tests.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses include compensation expenses for executive officers and administrative, billing and client service personnel, professional fees for legal and audit services, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, and other expenses such as information technology and miscellaneous expenses offset by allocation of facility and information technology expenses to other functions. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 67% of the average headcount classified as general and administrative encompass our billing and customer care teams. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we build our general and administration infrastructure and to stabilize thereafter.\nIntangible Asset Amortization\nOur finite-lived intangible assets, acquired in business combinations, are being amortized over 5 to15 years, using the straight-line method. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately $5.1 million per year through 2024 and decrease thereafter.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is attributable to our borrowings under debt agreements and capital leases as well as costs associated with the pre-payment of debt.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of sublease rental income and interest income from our cash held in interest bearing accounts.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nTesting Revenue\nWe recognize revenue related to billings on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nGenerally, we determine accrual rates based on the average reimbursement from payers for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects.\nWe use judgment in determining accrual rates and our judgments will continue to evolve in the future as we continue to gain reimbursement experience.\nBiopharmaceutical and Collaboration Revenue\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the research and development and/or commercialization of services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or samples, including intellectual property rights/licenses, research and development services, and/or commercialization of services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to us in the form of nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, royalty payments and/or profit sharing.\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nArrangements with partners may fall under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d). While these arrangements are in the scope of ASC 808, we may analogize to ASC 606 for some aspects of these arrangements. We analogize to ASC 606 for certain activities within the collaborative arrangement for the delivery of a good or service (i.e., a unit of account) that is part of our ongoing major or central operations.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should there be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nNet sales of data or other services to our customers are classified under biopharmaceutical revenue and collaboration revenue, such as milestones, are classified under collaboration revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Payments made to us that are not net sales of data or other services to our customers are recorded as an offset against research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nAcquisitions\nWe first determine whether a set of assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nContingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved, with the resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings.\nFinite-lived Intangible Assets\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations. We amortize finite-lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of five to 15 years, based on management's estimate of the period over which their economic benefits will be realized, product life and patent life. We test these finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value below their carrying amounts. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that it may be impaired. Our goodwill evaluation is based on both qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value. We have determined that we operate in a single segment and have a single reporting unit associated with the development and commercialization of diagnostic products. In the event we determine that it is more likely than not the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value, quantitative testing is performed comparing recorded values to estimated fair values. If impairment is present, the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the recorded goodwill over its implied fair value. We perform our annual evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. There was no impairment recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, or 2017.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for only those shares underlying stock options and restricted stock units that we expect to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected term and stock price volatility. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands of dollars, except percentages)\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Testing revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Biopharmaceutical revenue\n</td> <td>8,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>752\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>950\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>120,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of testing revenue\n</td> <td>36,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>14,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>53,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>29,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset amortization\n</td> <td>1,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>135,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(15,127\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22,233\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(66\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,963\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>3,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss and comprehensive loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,999\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Operating Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Genomic classifiers reported\n</td> <td>39,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nRevenue increased $28.4 million, or 31%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase in testing revenue from a 25% increase in genomic classifiers reported. We had a $15.8 million increase in testing revenue for our Afirma, Percepta, and Envisia classifiers in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. We also make adjustments, as necessary, for testing revenue accrued in prior periods as collections are made if the amount we expect to collect changes. The adjustment for testing revenue accrued in prior periods was $1.0 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, a net decrease of $1.0 million between the years. We also recognized $0.9 million from sales of Prosigna, a product that we acquired from NanoString in December 2019. We recognized $8.1 million of biopharmaceutical revenue compared to $1.0 million in 2018 primarily due to the performance of data sequencing services for Johnson & Johnson. We also recognized $4.0 million of collaboration revenue in 2019 due to the achievements of milestones under the agreement we signed with Johnson & Johnson in December 2018.\nComparison of revenue for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 25, 2019.

The increase in laboratory costs was primarily due to a 25% increase in reported genomic classifiers volume, partially offset by lower pricing on supplies and improved efficiencies following the completion of the transition from the Afirma GEC to Afirma GSC in the third quarter of 2018. The increase in sample collection costs was primarily related to the increase in the overall volume of samples received, partially offset by lower shipping costs from modifications to our collection kits. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to an average laboratory headcount increase of 16%. The decrease in license fees and royalties was due to the completed transition to the Afirma GSC in the third quarter of 2018, for which we do not pay license fees as we did in connection with the Afirma GEC. The increase in depreciation and amortization was from more equipment being placed into service. The increase in allocations was due to higher allocated costs from the increased headcount. Cost of product revenue was $0.4 million from sales of Prosigna in 2019, a product that we acquired from NanoString in December 2019.\nComparison of cost of testing revenue for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 25, 2019.

The increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment expenses related to the increase in headcount, which also increased allocated costs.\nComparison of selling and marketing expense for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 25, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows (in thousands of dollars, except percentages):\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>8,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy costs\n</td> <td>2,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>1,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(245\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>4,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allocations\n</td> <td>(6,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(950\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,768\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,963\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense increased $5.1 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in compensation expense was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense from the increase in our stock price. The increase in professional fees was mainly due to $1.5 million of expenses associated with our acquisition of NanoString Technologies. Inc.'s diagnostics business, $0.6 million in other increases in legal spend, and $0.3 million higher investor relations costs. The increase in other expenses was mainly from higher IT expenses to support the higher company headcount. The increase in expenses allocated to other departments was due to higher headcount in departments associated with selling and marketing and cost of revenue.\nComparison of general and administrative expense for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 25, 2019.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense decreased $1.3 million, or 66%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the prepayments of $12.5 million and $12.4 million of the principal amount of our Term Loan Advance in January 2019 and May 2019, respectively. The average Term Loan Advance interest rate was 6.70% and 6.14% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nComparison of interest expense for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 25, 2019.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net, increased $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher interest income from our cash and cash equivalents, which had higher balances in 2019 following our public offering of common stock in July 2018 and May 2019.\nComparison of Other income, net, for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in Item 8 of Part II of the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated February 25, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom inception through December 31, 2019, we have been financed primarily through net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities and borrowings under our credit facilities. We have incurred net losses since our inception. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had net losses of $12.6 million, $23.0 million and $31.0 million, respectively, and we expect to incur additional losses in 2020 and potentially in future years. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $246.7 million.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents of $159.3 million as of December 31, 2019, our available revolving line of credit, and our revenue during the next 12 months will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect that our near- and longer-term liquidity requirements will continue to consist of costs to run our laboratories, research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, working capital, costs to service our Loan and Security Agreement (See Note 8 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our Loan and Security Agreement), capital expenditures and general corporate expenses associated with the growth of our business. However, we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives, or forgo potential acquisitions or investments.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nOn May 7, 2019, we issued and sold 6,325,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including 825,000 shares issued and sold upon the underwriters' exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $23.25 per share. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $137.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $9.2 million.\nIn July 30, 2018, we issued and sold 5,750,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering, including 750,000 shares issued and sold upon the underwriters' exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares, at a price to the public of $10.25 per share. Our net proceeds from the offering were approximately $55.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of $3.9 million.\nLoan and Security Agreement\nOn November 3, 2017, we entered into the Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank. The Loan and Security Agreement allows us to borrow up to $35.0 million, with a $25.0 million term loan, or Term Loan, and a revolving line of credit of up to $10.0 million, or the Revolving Line of Credit, subject to, with respect to the Revolving Line of Credit, a borrowing base of 85% of eligible accounts receivable. The Term Loan was advanced upon the closing of the Loan and Security Agreement. Borrowings under the Loan and Security Agreement mature in October 2022. The Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate equal to (i) the thirty-day U.S. London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus (ii) 4.20%, with a minimum rate of 5.43% per annum. Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit bear interest at a variable rate equal to (i) LIBOR plus (ii) 3.50%, with a minimum rate of 4.70% per annum. We are also required to pay an annual facility fee on the Revolving Line of Credit of $25,000. The average Term Loan Advance interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 6.70%.\nWe may prepay the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan plus accrued and unpaid interest and, if the Term Loan is repaid in full, a prepayment premium. The prepayment premium will equal (i) $750,000, if the prepayment is made on or before November 3, 2018, (ii) $500,000, if the prepayment is made after November 3, 2018 and on or prior to November 3, 2019 and (iii) $250,000, if the prepayment is made after November 3, 2019. In addition, a final payment on the Term Loan in the amount of $1.2 million is due upon the earlier of the maturity date of the Term Loan or its payment in full. In January 2019 and May 2019, we prepaid $12.5 million and $12.4 million of the principal amount of the Term Loan Advance, respectively, and did not incur any prepayment premium as we did not repay the Term Loan Advance in full. These prepayments cover scheduled principal payments from November 2019 to September 2022.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and events of default such as a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial conditions, as well as affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include, among other provisions, covenants that limit or restrict our ability to incur liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge with or acquire other entities, dispose of assets, make dividends or other distributions to holders of our equity interests, engage in any new line of business, or enter into certain transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to certain exceptions. As of December 31, 2019, the principal balance outstanding was $0.1 million and we were in compliance with debt covenants.\nThe Loan and Security Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including achieving certain revenue levels tested quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis. However, failure to maintain the revenue levels will not be considered a default if the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents maintained with Silicon Valley Bank and amount available under the Revolving Line of Credit is at least $40.0 million.\nOur obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets (excluding intellectual property), subject to certain customary exceptions.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,232\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13,521\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,915\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(42,733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,315\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>127,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(218\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $3.2 million. The net loss of $12.6 million includes non-cash charges of $9.8 million of stock-based compensation expense and $4.1 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $1.4 million of intangible asset amortization, and $0.2 million of end-of-term debt obligation accruals. Cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities was $4.8 million, primarily comprised of an increase in accounts receivable of $6.2 million, increase in supplies of $3.4 million and increase in other assets of $0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities and deferred rent of $5.2 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $13.5 million. The net loss of $23.0 million includes non-cash charges of $6.0 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.9 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $1.1 million of intangible asset amortization. It also includes $0.3 million of end-of-term debt obligation accruals. Cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.7 million was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable of $1.6 million, an increase in other assets of $0.8 million and increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts receivable of $0.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in supplies of $1.9 million and an increase in accrued liabilities and deferred rent of $0.7 million.\nCash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $23.9 million. The net loss of $31.0 million includes non-cash charges of $6.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $3.8 million of depreciation and amortization, which includes $1.1 million of intangible asset amortization. It also includes a $1.5 million prepayment penalty for exiting our previous credit agreement which is a financing cash flow, and the amortization and write-off of $0.5 million of debt issuance costs. Cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $5.4 million was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $4.0 million, an increase in supplies inventory of $1.8 million and a decrease in accrued liabilities and deferred rent of $1.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $1.7 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $42.7 million, consisting of $40.0 million for the acquisition of NanoString Technologies, Inc.'s diagnostics business, and $2.7 million for the acquisition of property and equipment, net of proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.9 million for the acquisition of property and equipment.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.2 million, mainly comprising $1.8 million for the acquisition of property and equipment, partially offset by $0.4 million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $127.3 million, consisting of $137.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering in May 2019 and $14.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchase of stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, during the year, partially offset by $24.9 million of loan principal repayments and finance lease payments of $0.3 million.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $59.5 million, consisting of $55.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering in the second quarter of 2018, $4.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock and purchases under our ESPP and $0.4 million in proceeds from a legal settlement, partially offset by capital lease payments of $0.3 million during the period.\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.2 million, consisting of a $25.4 million payment of the principal on prior credit agreement, $1.5 million payment for the prepayment premium for terminating the prior credit agreement and $0.3 million of capital lease payments, partially offset by $24.9 million of net proceeds from our new loan and security agreement, $1.9 million in proceeds from the purchase of stock under our ESPP and exercise of options to purchase our common stock.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes certain contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands of dollars):\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2021 to 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2023 to 2024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2025 and Beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supplies purchase commitments\n</td> <td>5,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Represents minimum operating lease payments under operating leases for facilities.\n(2) Debt obligations include principal, estimate of variable rate interest and end-of-term debt obligation.

This ASU is aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable, and requires substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability, including leases currently accounted for as operating leases. The ASU was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Additionally, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements, which offers an additional transition method whereby entities may apply the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings rather than application of the new leases standard at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements. We elected this transition method and adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 and as a result, recorded operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets of $9.8 million, including offsetting deferred rent of $4.3 million, along with the associated operating lease liabilities of $14.1 million. On January 1, 2019, we had finance lease ROU assets of $0.8 million and associated finance lease liabilities of $0.3 million for leases classified as finance leases prior to the adoption of ASC 842. The adoption of ASC 842 had an immaterial impact on the our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated statement of stockholders' equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which allowed it to carry forward the historical lease\nclassification. Additional information and disclosures required by this new standard are contained in Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets. This guidance will become effective for us beginning January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on its financial statements. We do not expect to have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures from the adoption of this guidance.\nIn November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808). Under this ASU, transactions in collaborative arrangements are to be accounted for under ASC 606 if the counterparty is a customer for a good or service (or bundle of goods and services) that is a distinct unit of account. Also, entities are precluded from presenting consideration from transactions with a counterparty that is not a customer together with revenue recognized from ASC 606. This ASU is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the ASU in 2019 with no cumulative-effect adjustments or retrospective impact.", "summary": "The report discusses a leading genomic diagnostics company's financial condition and operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is creating value through innovation. We were founded in 2008 with a mission of improving diagnostic accuracy. Today, our growing menu of tests leverage advances in genomic science and technology to improve care throughout the patient journey, enabling more confident diagnostic, prognostic and treatment decisions in cancer and other challenging diseases. We are creating new standards of care by enabling more patients to avoid risks of unnecessary invasive procedures and removing costs from the healthcare system, while speeding the time to diagnosis and treatment decisions.\nWe perform our genomic tests for thyroid cancer, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, in our CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California. In December 2019, we announced our acquisition from NanoString Technologies, Inc., or NanoString, of the exclusive global diagnostics license to the nCounter FLEX Analysis System, as well as the Prosigna breast cancer prognostic gene signature assay, which is commercially available, and the LymphMark lymphoma subtyping assay, which is in development. Both tests are designed for use on the nCounter system. We believe this strategic transaction positions us to expand our business globally with a broad menu of advanced genomic tests that may be offered as distributed kits and performed in local laboratories worldwide. We believe our current and pipeline products address a collective $40 billion global market.\nWe currently offer five commercialized genomic tests that are changing disease diagnosis and patient care. All five tests are available in the United States and one is available internationally. These include the Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier, or GSC (its predecessor was the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC) for thyroid cancer; the Percepta GSC (its predecessor was the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier) for lung cancer; the Envisia Genomic Classifier for IPF; the Afirma Xpression Atlas, which provides information on the most common and emerging gene alterations associated with thyroid cancer, enabling physicians to confidently tailor surgical and treatment decisions at time of diagnosis; and the Prosigna breast cancer test for assessing risk of distant recurrence, which is available for use on the nCounter platform in the United States and internationally.\nOur ability to leverage RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing data in large biorepositories of patient-consented samples in oncology and other indications presents an opportunity for biopharmaceutical companies to enhance their research and development capabilities. In April 2018, we announced a collaboration with Loxo Oncology (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company) to advance our development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer. In December 2018, we entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovation and the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson to advance the development and commercialization of novel diagnostic tests to detect lung cancer at its earliest stages, when the disease is most treatable. The collaboration builds upon foundational \"field of injury\" science where genomic changes associated with lung cancer can be identified with a simple brushing of a person's airway to develop new interventions that can save lives. Additionally, in January 2020, we announced an agreement with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development arm of AstraZeneca, to provide genomic information that will support its development of oncology therapeutics in lymphoma.\nPatients access our tests through their physician. Our Afirma, Percepta and Envisia tests are used as part of the diagnostic process and genomic testing services are performed in our CLIA laboratory located in San Francisco, California. Cytopathology services for Afirma testing are performed in our reference laboratory in Austin, Texas. The Prosigna test is indicated in female breast cancer patients who have undergone surgery in conjunction with locoregional treatment consistent with standard of care. This in vitro diagnostic test is performed on the nCounter Flex Analysis System in laboratories worldwide, as well as in the United States.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year:\n \u2022 Total Revenue was $29.7 million, an increase of 15%; \n \u2022 Gross Margin was 66%, unchanged; \n \u2022 Operating Expenses, Excluding Cost of Revenue, were $27.8 million, an increase of 38%; \n \u2022 Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss was ($7.5) million, an increase of 140%; \n \u2022 Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share was ($0.15), an increase of 88%; \n \u2022 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $1.8 million, compared to $1.2 million used; and \n \u2022 Cash and Cash Equivalents was $159.3 million at December 31, 2019. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year:\n \u2022 Total Revenue was $120.4 million, an increase of 31%; \n \u2022 Gross Margin was 70%, an increase of six percentage points; \n \u2022 Operating Expenses, Excluding Cost of Revenue, were $99.0 million, an increase of 22%; \n \u2022 Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss was ($12.6) million, an improvement of 45%; \n \u2022 Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share was ($0.27), an improvement of 56%; and \n \u2022 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities was $3.2 million, an improvement of 76%. \n2019 Full-Year and Recent Business Highlights\nCommercial Growth:\n \u2022 Achieved strong total revenue growth across our testing and product portfolio delivering $29.5 million in the fourth quarter and $108.3 million for 2019, an increase of 16% and 19%, respectively, compared to the prior year. \n \u2022 Accelerated pulmonology testing revenue to $2.0 million and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, a 123% and 174% increase compared to prior year. \n \u2022 Grew total genomic volume (Afirma, Percepta and Envisia) by 18% to 10,846 tests in the fourth quarter of 2019 and by 25% to 39,612 tests in 2019, compared to prior year. \n \u2022 Increased genomic volume for our pulmonology products by 136% in 2019 compared to prior year, achieving growth targets for both the Percepta and Envisia classifiers. \n \u2022 Received final Medicare coverage in March 2019 for the Envisia classifier and published strong clinical validation and clinical utility data in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, propelling nationwide commercial expansion of the test in the second half of 2019. \n \u2022 Expanded payer contracts by 14.4 million lives, making Veracyte an in-network genomic testing provider to health plans representing over 225 million members. \n \u2022 Continued to build an extensive library of clinical data across our portfolio in 2019, including 8 publications and 11 presentations at leading medical meetings, demonstrating our Afirma and pulmonology tests' performance and clinical utility. \n \u2022 Eleven abstracts were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2019, including data showing a benefit of Prosigna\u00ae over other genomic testing to identify patients' long-term risk of developing distant metastases. In addition, data were presented showing the test's ability to identify patients with intrinsic breast cancer subtypes that may potentially benefit from CDK4/6 inhibitors in place of standard chemotherapy. \nBiopharmaceutical Collaborations/Pipeline Advancement:\n \u2022 In January 2019, announced a long-term strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovation LLC to advance the development and commercialization of novel diagnostic tests to detect lung cancer at its earliest stages, when the disease is most treatable. \n \u2022 Presented preliminary data at the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) annual meeting for our first-of-its-kind noninvasive nasal swab classifier for improved lung cancer diagnosis. The test, being developed through our Johnson & Johnson collaboration, is expected to launch in early 2021. \n \u2022 Launched the second-generation Percepta GSC, completing the transition of our core classifiers to our RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing platform. \n \u2022 Announced a multi-year collaboration with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development arm of AstraZeneca plc, to provide genomic information that will support the biopharmaceutical company's development of oncology therapeutics in lymphoma. \nGlobal Expansion:\n \u2022 Acquired the exclusive global diagnostic rights to the NanoString nCounter FLEX Analysis System, as well as the Prosigna breast cancer assay and the in-development LymphMark lymphoma subtyping test. We believe this transaction positions us to access a $40 billion global market for our current and pipeline products, by offering a broad menu of advanced genomic tests in oncology and other indications using a distributed-kit model. \nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nReported Genomic Test Volume\nOur performance depends on the number of genomic tests that we perform and report as completed in our CLIA laboratories. Factors impacting the number of tests that we report as completed include, but are not limited to:\n \u2022 the number of samples that we receive that meet the medical indication for each test performed; \n \u2022 the quantity and quality of the sample received; \n \u2022 receipt of the necessary documentation, such as physician order and patient consent, required to perform, bill and collect for our tests; \n \u2022 the patient's ability to pay or provide necessary insurance coverage for the tests performed; \n \u2022 the time it takes us to perform our tests and report the results; \n \u2022 the seasonality inherent in our business, such as the impact of work days per period, timing of industry conferences and the timing of when patient deductibles are exceeded, which also impacts the reimbursement we receive from insurers; and \n \u2022 our ability to obtain prior authorization or meet other requirements instituted by payers, benefit managers, or regulators necessary to be paid for our tests. \nWe generate substantially all our revenue from genomic testing services, including the rendering of a cytopathology diagnosis as part of the Afirma solution. For the Afirma classifier, we do not accrue revenue for approximately 5% - 10% of the tests that we perform and report as complete due principally to insufficient RNA from which to render a result and tests performed for which we do not reasonably expect to be paid.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products\nRevenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. To drive increased adoption of our products, we increased our sales force and marketing efforts over the last several years. Our sales team is structured to sell all of our products; we do not maintain a separate sales force for each product. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates.\nIntegrating acquired assets and advances to our collaborations\nRevenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate the assets acquired into our existing business. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of operations, cause significant write-offs of intangible assets, or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. The integration of assets acquired from NanoString in December 2019 may\nimpact our revenue and operating results through integration of a sales force, development of a product supply operation and the expansion of our business internationally with a broad menu of advanced genomic tests that may be offered.\nRevenue growth or reimbursement from our collaborations depends on our ability to deliver services or information and achieve milestones required from our collaborative partners. Our collaboration parters pay us for the provision of data, other services and the achievement of milestones. Under a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson in 2018, we provided data services required under this agreement for $7.0 million in 2019, however, there remains $9.0 of revenue associated with development and commercialization milestones yet to be achieved.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nTesting Revenue\nWe commenced recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers starting January 1, 2018. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 954-605, Health Care Entities - Revenue Recognition.\nMost of our revenue is generated from the provision of diagnostic services. These services are completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician, at which time we bill for the services. We recognize revenue related to billings on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nAs of December 31, 2019, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled approximately $159.3 million. Of this amount, we did not collect any amounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 and we have no expectation of future collection because we began accruing for substantially all revenue upon delivery of a patient report in the third quarter of 2016.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests.\nWe bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect. Finally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed.\nGenerally, we calculate the average reimbursement from our products from all payers, for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus, the average reimbursement per product represents the total cash collected to date against genomic classifier tests, including variants, performed during the relevant period divided by the number of these tests performed during that same period.\nThe average genomic classifier reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued, on average, between $2,800 and $2,900 for the Afirma genomic classifier tests, including variants, that met our revenue recognition standard, which was between 90% - 95% of the reported Afirma classifier test volume.\nFrom the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we accrued between $1.0 million and $2.4 million in revenue per quarter from providing cytopathology services associated with our Afirma solution.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met.\nProduct Revenue\nWe began recognizing product revenue in December 2019 in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when we executed an agreement with NanoString for the exclusive worldwide license to the nCounter platform for in vitro diagnostic use.\nWe recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products and services. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product or service. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue.\nOur products consist of the nCounter Analysis System and related consumables. Services consist of instrument service contracts and service fees for assay processing. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Collaboration Revenues\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for research and development and/or commercialization services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or samples, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&D services, and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to us in the form of nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, royalty payments, and/or profit sharing.\nThe terms of the Company's collaborative arrangements typically include one or more of the following: (i) up-front fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of development, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments may result in collaboration revenues or an offset against research and development expense.\nArrangements with partners may fall under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d). While these arrangements are in the scope of ASC 808, we may analogize to ASC 606 for some aspects of these arrangements. We analogize to ASC 606 for certain activities within the collaborative arrangement for the delivery of a good or service (i.e., a unit of account) that is part of our ongoing major or central operations.\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods is transferred or services are performed. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should\nthere be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nNet sales of data or other services to our customers are classified under biopharmaceutical revenue and collaboration revenue, such as milestones, are classified under collaboration revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Payments made to us that are not net sales of data or other services to our customers are recorded as an offset against research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nDevelopment of Additional Tests\nWe continue to advance our portfolio of diagnostic tests that leverage innovations in genomic science, sequencing technology and machine learning methodologies to further improve patient care. In May 2017, we introduced the Afirma GSC, supported by rigorous clinical validation data showing that the RNA sequencing-based test can help significantly more patients avoid unnecessary surgery in thyroid cancer diagnosis, compared to the original Afirma classifier. In March 2018, we unveiled our Afirma Xpression Atlas, which uses the same RNA sequencing data from the platform as the Afirma GSC and enables us to extract rich genomic content - including gene expression, DNA variants and RNA fusions in over 500 genes that are associated with thyroid cancer - from thyroid FNA samples. We believe that this offering will provide clinicians with valuable genomic information that may inform surgery strategy and treatment options for patients with suspected thyroid cancer.\nTogether with our Afirma GSC and our tests for the BRAF v600E mutation and medullary thyroid cancer, or Malignancy Classifiers, the Afirma Xpression Atlas rounds out a comprehensive solution for physicians evaluating thyroid nodules. This innovation also enables us to enter into research collaboration with biopharmaceutical companies, which is intended to support their development of targeted therapies for genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer.\nWe have also expanded our ability to provide important clinical answers - without the need for surgery - into pulmonology. Our Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier, introduced in April 2015, is the first genomic test to receive Medicare coverage for use in lung cancer diagnosis, where it improves the performance of diagnostic bronchoscopy. In June 2019, we began making our next-generation\u201d Percepta Genomic Sequencing Classifier available to physicians, providing them with expanded lung cancer risk information that can further guide next steps for patients with suspicious lung nodules, as compared to the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier.\nAdditionally, our Envisia Genomic Classifier, launched in October 2016, is the first commercial test to improve the diagnosis of IPF among patients with a suspected interstitial lung disease. In March 2019, we received final Medicare coverage for the Envisia classifier through the MolDX program, with an effective date of April 1, 2019.\nWe also believe our Xpression Atlas platform can be transferred to our pulmonology indications, to further improve patient care and advance precision medicine in lung cancer and IPF.\nWe are currently exploring opportunities to utilize the same field of injury\u201d technology that powers our Percepta classifier to develop a nasal swab test that can enable earlier lung cancer detection - and ultimately help reduce lung cancer deaths. In October 2019, we announced preliminary clinical data showing for our noninvasive nasal swab classifier - the first test of its kind. The findings show that the novel genomic test can accurately classify lung cancer risk in patients with lung nodules so that these patients can obtain the prompt diagnosis and potential treatment they need or may be monitored noninvasively.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nTesting Revenue\nThrough December 31, 2019, we derived a substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of Afirma delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\n\nFor tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods.\nCost of Testing Revenue\nThe components of our cost of revenue are laboratory expenses, kit costs, sample collection expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation and amortization, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, run quality control batches, test batches, registry samples and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and consumables from third-party contract", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those set forth under the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A, and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nOverview\nWe are a leading genomic diagnostics company that is creating value through innovation. We were founded in 2008 with a mission of improving diagnostic accuracy. Today, our growing menu of tests leverage advances in genomic science and technology to improve care throughout the patient journey, enabling more confident diagnostic, prognostic and treatment decisions in cancer and other challenging diseases. We are creating new standards of care by enabling more patients to avoid risks of unnecessary invasive procedures and removing costs from the healthcare system, while speeding the time to diagnosis and treatment decisions.\nWe perform our genomic tests for thyroid cancer, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, in our CLIA-certified laboratory in South San Francisco, California. In December 2019, we announced our acquisition from NanoString Technologies, Inc., or NanoString, of the exclusive global diagnostics license to the nCounter FLEX Analysis System, as well as the Prosigna breast cancer prognostic gene signature assay, which is commercially available, and the LymphMark lymphoma subtyping assay, which is in development. Both tests are designed for use on the nCounter system. We believe this strategic transaction positions us to expand our business globally with a broad menu of advanced genomic tests that may be offered as distributed kits and performed in local laboratories worldwide. We believe our current and pipeline products address a collective $40 billion global market.\nWe currently offer five commercialized genomic tests that are changing disease diagnosis and patient care. All five tests are available in the United States and one is available internationally. These include the Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier, or GSC (its predecessor was the Afirma Gene Expression Classifier, or GEC) for thyroid cancer; the Percepta GSC (its predecessor was the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier) for lung cancer; the Envisia Genomic Classifier for IPF; the Afirma Xpression Atlas, which provides information on the most common and emerging gene alterations associated with thyroid cancer, enabling physicians to confidently tailor surgical and treatment decisions at time of diagnosis; and the Prosigna breast cancer test for assessing risk of distant recurrence, which is available for use on the nCounter platform in the United States and internationally.\nOur ability to leverage RNA whole-transcriptome sequencing data in large biorepositories of patient-consented samples in oncology and other indications presents an opportunity for biopharmaceutical companies to enhance their research and development capabilities. In April 2018, we announced a collaboration with Loxo Oncology (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Eli Lilly and Company) to advance our development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer. In December 2018, we entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with Johnson & Johnson Innovation and the Lung Cancer Initiative at Johnson & Johnson to advance the development and commercialization of novel diagnostic tests to detect lung cancer at its earliest stages, when the disease is most treatable. The collaboration builds upon foundational \"field of injury\" science where genomic changes associated with lung cancer can be identified with a simple brushing of a person's airway to develop new interventions that can save lives. Additionally, in January 2020, we announced an agreement with Acerta Pharma, the hematology research and development arm of AstraZeneca, to provide genomic information that will support its development of oncology therapeutics in lymphoma.\nPatients access our tests through their physician. Our Afirma, Percepta and Envisia tests are used as part of the diagnostic process and genomic testing services are performed in our CLIA laboratory located in San Francisco, California. Cytopathology services for Afirma testing are performed in our reference laboratory in Austin, Texas. The Prosigna test is indicated in female breast cancer patients who have undergone surgery in conjunction with locoregional treatment consistent with standard of care. This in vitro diagnostic test is performed on the nCounter Flex Analysis System in laboratories worldwide, as well as in the United States.\nFourth Quarter and Full-Year 2019 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year:\n \u2022 Total Revenue was $29.7 million, an increase of 15%; \n \u2022 Gross Margin was 66%, unchanged; \n \u2022 Operating Expenses, Excluding Cost of Revenue, were $27.8 million, an increase of 38%; \n \u2022 Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss was ($7.5) million, an increase of 140%; \n \u2022 Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share was ($0.15), an increase of 88%; \n \u2022 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $1.8 million, compared to $1.2 million used; and \n \u2022 Cash and Cash Equivalents was $159.3 million at December 31, 2019. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the prior year:\n \u2022 Total Revenue was $120.4 million, an increase of 31%; \n \u2022 Gross Margin was 70%, an increase of six percentage points; \n \u2022 Operating Expenses, Excluding Cost of Revenue, were $99.0 million, an increase of 22%; \n \u2022 Net Loss and Comprehensive Loss was ($12.6) million, an improvement of 45%; \n \u2022 Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Common Share was ($0.27), an improvement of 56%; and \n \u2022 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities was $3.2 million, an improvement of 76%. \n2019 Full-Year and Recent Business Highlights\nCommercial Growth:\n \u2022 Achieved strong total revenue growth across our testing and product portfolio delivering $29.5 million in the fourth quarter and $108.3 million for 2019, an increase of 16% and 19%, respectively, compared to the prior year. \n \u2022 Accelerated pulmonology testing revenue to $2.0 million and $5.5 million for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, a 123% and 174% increase compared to prior year. \n \u2022 Grew total genomic volume (Afirma, Percepta and Envisia) by 18% to 10,846 tests in the fourth quarter of 2019 and by 25% to 39,612 tests in 2019, compared to prior year. \n \u2022 Increased genomic volume for our pulmonology products by 136% in 2019 compared to prior year, achieving growth targets for both the Percepta and Envisia classifiers. \n \u2022 Received final Medicare coverage in March 2019 for the Envisia classifier and published strong clinical validation and clinical utility data in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, propelling nationwide commercial expansion of the test in the second half of 2019. \n \u2022 Expanded payer contracts by 14.4 million lives, making Veracyte an in-network genomic testing provider to health plans representing over 225 million members. \n \u2022 Continued to build an extensive library of clinical data across our portfolio in 2019, including 8 publications and 11 presentations at leading medical meetings, demonstrating our Afirma and pulmonology tests' performance and clinical utility. \n \u2022 Eleven abstracts were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2019, including data showing a benefit of Prosigna\u00ae over other genomic testing to identify patients' long-term risk of developing distant metastases.

For the Afirma classifier, we do not accrue revenue for approximately 5% - 10% of the tests that we perform and report as complete due principally to insufficient RNA from which to render a result and tests performed for which we do not reasonably expect to be paid.\nContinued Adoption of and Reimbursement for our Products\nRevenue growth depends on our ability to secure coverage decisions, achieve broader reimbursement at increased levels from third-party payers, expand our base of prescribing physicians and increase our penetration in existing accounts. Because some payers consider our products experimental and investigational, we may not receive payment for tests and payments we receive may not be at acceptable levels. We expect our revenue growth to increase if more payers make a positive coverage decision and as payers enter into contracts with us, which should enhance our revenue and cash collections. To drive increased adoption of our products, we increased our sales force and marketing efforts over the last several years. Our sales team is structured to sell all of our products; we do not maintain a separate sales force for each product. If we are unable to expand the base of prescribing physicians and penetration within these accounts at an acceptable rate, or if we are not able to execute our strategy for increasing reimbursement, we may not be able to effectively increase our revenue. We expect to continue to see pressure from payers to limit the utilization of tests, generally, and we believe more payers are deploying cost containment tactics, such as pre-authorization, reduction of the payer portion of reimbursement and employing laboratory benefit managers to reduce utilization rates.\nIntegrating acquired assets and advances to our collaborations\nRevenue growth, operational results and advances to our business strategy depends on our ability to integrate the assets acquired into our existing business. The integration of acquired assets may impact our revenue growth, increase the cost of operations, cause significant write-offs of intangible assets, or may require management resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. The integration of assets acquired from NanoString in December 2019 may\nimpact our revenue and operating results through integration of a sales force, development of a product supply operation and the expansion of our business internationally with a broad menu of advanced genomic tests that may be offered.\nRevenue growth or reimbursement from our collaborations depends on our ability to deliver services or information and achieve milestones required from our collaborative partners. Our collaboration parters pay us for the provision of data, other services and the achievement of milestones. Under a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson in 2018, we provided data services required under this agreement for $7.0 million in 2019, however, there remains $9.0 of revenue associated with development and commercialization milestones yet to be achieved.\nHow We Recognize Revenue\nTesting Revenue\nWe commenced recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers starting January 1, 2018. Prior to January 1, 2018, we recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 954-605, Health Care Entities - Revenue Recognition.\nMost of our revenue is generated from the provision of diagnostic services. These services are completed upon the delivery of test results to the prescribing physician, at which time we bill for the services. We recognize revenue related to billings on an accrual basis based on estimates of the amount that will ultimately be realized. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current developments or changes that could impact reimbursement. These estimates require significant judgment by management.\nAs of December 31, 2019, cumulative amounts billed at list price for tests processed which were not recognized as revenue upon delivery of a patient report because our accrual revenue recognition criteria were not met and for which we have not collected cash or written off as uncollectible, totaled approximately $159.3 million. Of this amount, we did not collect any amounts in the year ended December 31, 2019 and we have no expectation of future collection because we began accruing for substantially all revenue upon delivery of a patient report in the third quarter of 2016.\nGenerally, cash we receive is collected within 12 months of the date the test is billed. We cannot provide any assurance as to when, if ever, or to what extent any of these amounts will be collected. Notwithstanding our efforts to obtain payment for these tests, payers may deny our claims, in whole or in part, and we may never receive payment for these tests.\nWe bill list price regardless of contract rate, but only recognize revenue from amounts that we estimate are collectible and meet our revenue recognition criteria. Revenue may not be equal to the billed amount due to a number of factors that we consider when determining revenue accrual rates, including differences in reimbursement rates, the amounts of patient co-payments and co-insurance, the existence of secondary payers, claims denials and the amount we expect to ultimately collect. Finally, when we increase our list price, it will increase the cumulative amounts billed but may not positively impact accrued revenue. In addition, payer contracts generally include the right of offset and payers may offset payments prior to resolving disputes over tests performed.\nGenerally, we calculate the average reimbursement from our products from all payers, for tests that are on average a year old, since it can take a significant period of time to collect from some payers. Except in situations where we believe the rate we reasonably expect to collect to vary due to a coverage decision, contract, more recent reimbursement data or evidence to the contrary, we use an average of reimbursement for tests provided over four quarters as it reduces the effects of temporary volatility and seasonal effects. Thus, the average reimbursement per product represents the total cash collected to date against genomic classifier tests, including variants, performed during the relevant period divided by the number of these tests performed during that same period.\nThe average genomic classifier reimbursement rate will change over time due to a number of factors, including medical coverage decisions by payers, the effects of contracts signed with payers, changes in allowed amounts by payers, our ability to successfully win appeals for payment, and our ability to collect cash payments from third-party payers and individual patients. Historical average reimbursement is not necessarily indicative of future average reimbursement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we accrued, on average, between $2,800 and $2,900 for the Afirma genomic classifier tests, including variants, that met our revenue recognition standard, which was between 90% - 95% of the reported Afirma classifier test volume.\nFrom the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we accrued between $1.0 million and $2.4 million in revenue per quarter from providing cytopathology services associated with our Afirma solution.\nWe incur expense for tests in the period in which the test is conducted and recognize revenue for tests in the period in which our revenue recognition criteria are met.\nProduct Revenue\nWe began recognizing product revenue in December 2019 in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, when we executed an agreement with NanoString for the exclusive worldwide license to the nCounter platform for in vitro diagnostic use.\nWe recognize product revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products and services. This process involves identifying the contract with a customer, determining the performance obligations in the contract, determining the contract price, allocating the contract price to the distinct performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when the performance obligations have been satisfied. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. Performance obligations are considered satisfied once we have transferred control of a product or service to the customer, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the product or service. We recognize product revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Shipping and handling costs incurred for product shipments are charged to our customers and included in product revenue.\nOur products consist of the nCounter Analysis System and related consumables. Services consist of instrument service contracts and service fees for assay processing. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities.\nBiopharmaceutical and Collaboration Revenues\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for research and development and/or commercialization services. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or samples, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&D services, and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to us in the form of nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, royalty payments, and/or profit sharing.\nThe terms of the Company's collaborative arrangements typically include one or more of the following: (i) up-front fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of development, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments may result in collaboration revenues or an offset against research and development expense.\nArrangements with partners may fall under the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d). While these arrangements are in the scope of ASC 808, we may analogize to ASC 606 for some aspects of these arrangements. We analogize to ASC 606 for certain activities within the collaborative arrangement for the delivery of a good or service (i.e., a unit of account) that is part of our ongoing major or central operations.\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\nThe consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods is transferred or services are performed. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should\nthere be royalties, we utilize the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\nNet sales of data or other services to our customers are classified under biopharmaceutical revenue and collaboration revenue, such as milestones, are classified under collaboration revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Payments made to us that are not net sales of data or other services to our customers are recorded as an offset against research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nDevelopment of Additional Tests\nWe continue to advance our portfolio of diagnostic tests that leverage innovations in genomic science, sequencing technology and machine learning methodologies to further improve patient care. In May 2017, we introduced the Afirma GSC, supported by rigorous clinical validation data showing that the RNA sequencing-based test can help significantly more patients avoid unnecessary surgery in thyroid cancer diagnosis, compared to the original Afirma classifier. In March 2018, we unveiled our Afirma Xpression Atlas, which uses the same RNA sequencing data from the platform as the Afirma GSC and enables us to extract rich genomic content - including gene expression, DNA variants and RNA fusions in over 500 genes that are associated with thyroid cancer - from thyroid FNA samples. We believe that this offering will provide clinicians with valuable genomic information that may inform surgery strategy and treatment options for patients with suspected thyroid cancer.\nTogether with our Afirma GSC and our tests for the BRAF v600E mutation and medullary thyroid cancer, or Malignancy Classifiers, the Afirma Xpression Atlas rounds out a comprehensive solution for physicians evaluating thyroid nodules. This innovation also enables us to enter into research collaboration with biopharmaceutical companies, which is intended to support their development of targeted therapies for genetically defined cancers, including thyroid cancer.\nWe have also expanded our ability to provide important clinical answers - without the need for surgery - into pulmonology. Our Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier, introduced in April 2015, is the first genomic test to receive Medicare coverage for use in lung cancer diagnosis, where it improves the performance of diagnostic bronchoscopy. In June 2019, we began making our next-generation\u201d Percepta Genomic Sequencing Classifier available to physicians, providing them with expanded lung cancer risk information that can further guide next steps for patients with suspicious lung nodules, as compared to the Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier.\nAdditionally, our Envisia Genomic Classifier, launched in October 2016, is the first commercial test to improve the diagnosis of IPF among patients with a suspected interstitial lung disease. In March 2019, we received final Medicare coverage for the Envisia classifier through the MolDX program, with an effective date of April 1, 2019.\nWe also believe our Xpression Atlas platform can be transferred to our pulmonology indications, to further improve patient care and advance precision medicine in lung cancer and IPF.\nWe are currently exploring opportunities to utilize the same field of injury\u201d technology that powers our Percepta classifier to develop a nasal swab test that can enable earlier lung cancer detection - and ultimately help reduce lung cancer deaths. In October 2019, we announced preliminary clinical data showing for our noninvasive nasal swab classifier - the first test of its kind. The findings show that the novel genomic test can accurately classify lung cancer risk in patients with lung nodules so that these patients can obtain the prompt diagnosis and potential treatment they need or may be monitored noninvasively.\nTiming of Our Research and Development Expenses\nWe deploy state-of-the-art and costly genomic technologies in our biomarker discovery experiments, and our spending on these technologies may vary substantially from quarter to quarter. We also spend a significant amount to secure clinical samples that can be used in discovery and product development as well as clinical validation studies. The timing of these research and development activities is difficult to predict, as is the timing of sample acquisitions. If a substantial number of clinical samples are acquired in a given quarter or if a high-cost experiment is conducted in one quarter versus the next, the timing of these expenses can affect our financial results. We conduct clinical studies to validate our new products as well as on-going clinical studies to further the published evidence to support our commercialized tests. As these studies are initiated, start-up costs for each site can be significant and concentrated in a specific quarter. Spending on research and development, for both experiments and studies, may vary significantly by quarter depending on the timing of these various expenses.\nFinancial Overview\nTesting Revenue\nThrough December 31, 2019, we derived a substantial majority of our revenue from the sale of Afirma delivered primarily to physicians in the United States. We generally invoice third-party payers upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician. As such, we take the assignment of benefits and the risk of cash collection from the third-party payer and individual patients. Third-party payers and other customers in excess of 10% of total revenue and their related revenue as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UnitedHealthcare\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor tests performed, we recognize the related revenue upon delivery of a patient report to the prescribing physician based on the amount that we expect to ultimately receive. In determining the amount to accrue for a delivered test, we consider factors such as payment history, payer coverage, whether there is a reimbursement contract between the payer and us, payment as a percentage of agreed upon reimbursement rate (if applicable), amount paid per test and any current development or changes that could impact reimbursement. Upon ultimate collection, the amount received is compared to previous estimates and the amount accrued is adjusted accordingly. Our ability to increase our revenue will depend on our ability to penetrate the market, obtain positive coverage policies from additional third-party payers, obtain reimbursement and/or enter into contracts with additional third-party payers for our current and new tests, and increase reimbursement rates for tests performed. Finally, should the judgments underlying our estimated reimbursement change, our accrued revenue and financial results could be negatively impacted in future periods.\nCost of Testing Revenue\nThe components of our cost of revenue are laboratory expenses, kit costs, sample collection expenses, compensation expense, license fees and royalties, depreciation and amortization, other expenses such as equipment and laboratory supplies, and allocations of facility and information technology expenses. Costs associated with performing tests are recorded as the test is processed regardless of whether and when revenue is recognized with respect to that test. As a result, our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may vary significantly from period to period because we may not recognize all revenue in the period in which the associated costs are incurred. We expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars to increase as the number of tests we perform increases. However, we expect that the cost per test will decrease over time due to leveraging fixed costs, efficiencies we may gain as test volume increases and from automation, process efficiencies and other cost reductions. As we introduce new tests, initially our cost of revenue will be high as we expect to run suboptimal batch sizes, run quality control batches, test batches, registry samples and generally incur costs that may suppress or reduce gross margins. This will disproportionately increase our aggregate cost of revenue until we achieve efficiencies in processing these new tests.\nCost of Product Revenue\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of costs of purchasing instruments and consumables from third-party contract"}
