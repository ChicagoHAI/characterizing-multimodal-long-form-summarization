MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report\u201d). Historical results and any discussion of prospective results may not indicate our future performance.\nBusiness Overview\nFTI Consulting is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political and regulatory, reputational and transactional. Individually, each of our practices is staffed with experts recognized for the depth of their knowledge and a track record of making an impact. Collectively, FTI Consulting offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to assist clients across the business cycle, from proactive risk management to rapid response to unexpected events and dynamic environments.\nWe report financial results for the following five reportable segments:\nOur Corporate Finance & Restructuring ( Corporate Finance\u201d) segment focuses on the strategic, operational, financial and capital needs of our clients around the world and delivers a wide range of service offerings related to restructuring, business transformation and transaction support. Our restructuring practice includes corporate restructuring, including bankruptcy and interim management services. Our business transformation and transactions support practices include financings, mergers and acquisitions (\"M&A\"), M&A integration, valuations and tax advice, as well as financial, operational and performance improvement services.\nOur Forensic and Litigation Consulting ( FLC\u201d) segment provides law firms, companies, government clients and other interested parties with multidisciplinary, independent dispute advisory, investigations, data analytics, forensic accounting, business intelligence and risk mitigation services, as well as interim management and performance improvement services for our health solutions practice clients.\nOur Economic Consulting segment provides law firms, companies, government entities and other interested parties with analysis of complex economic issues for use in legal, regulatory and international arbitration proceedings, strategic decision making and public policy debates in the United States (\"U.S.\") and around the world.\nOur Technology segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of information governance and electronic discovery (\"e-discovery\") software, services and consulting support to companies, law firms, courts and government agencies worldwide. Our services allow our clients to control the risk and expense of e-discovery events more confidently, as well as manage their data in the context of compliance and risk.\nOur Strategic Communications segment designs and executes communications strategies for management teams and boards of directors to help them seize opportunities, manage financial, regulatory and reputational challenges, navigate market disruptions, articulate their brand, stake a competitive position, and preserve and grow their operations.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to both U.S. and global clients. Most of our services are rendered under time-and-expense arrangements that obligate the client to pay us a fee for the hours that we incur at agreed-upon rates. Under this arrangement, we typically bill our clients for reimbursable expenses, which may include the cost of producing our work product and other direct expenses that we incur on behalf of the client, such as travel costs. We also render services for which certain clients may be required to pay us a fixed fee or recurring retainer. These arrangements are generally cancelable at any time. Some of our engagements contain performance-based arrangements in which we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. This type of success fee may supplement a time-and-expense or fixed fee arrangement. Success fee revenues may cause variations in our revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance-based criteria. Seasonal factors, such as the timing of our employees' and clients' vacations and holidays, may impact the timing of our revenues across our segments.\nIn our Technology segment, certain clients are billed based on the amount of data stored on our electronic systems, the volume of information processed or the number of users licensing our Ringtail\u00ae software prior to its sale in September 2018, and our other software products. We licensed, and in some cases continue to license, certain products directly to end users, as well as indirectly through our channel partner relationships. Unit-based revenues are defined as revenues billed on a per item, per page or some other unit-based method and include revenues from data processing and hosting, software usage and software\nlicensing. Unit-based revenues include revenues associated with the software products that are made available to customers, either via a web browser ( on-demand\u201d) or installed at our customer or partner locations ( on-premise\u201d). On-demand revenues are charged on a unit or monthly basis and include, but are not limited to, processing and review related functions. On-premise revenues are composed of upfront license fees, with recurring support and maintenance.\nOur financial results are primarily driven by:\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number, size and type of engagements we secure;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the rate per hour or fixed charges we charge our clients for services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the utilization rates of the revenue-generating professionals we employ;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing of revenue recognition related to revenues subject to certain performance-based contingencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the number of revenue-generating professionals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>licensing of our software products and other technology services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the types of assignments we are working on at different times;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the length of the billing and collection cycles; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the geographic locations of our clients or locations in which services are rendered.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We define acquisition growth as revenues of acquired companies in the first 12 months following the effective date of an acquisition. Our definition of organic growth is the change in revenues, excluding the impact of all such acquisitions.\nWhen significant, we identify the estimated impact of foreign currency translation ( FX\u201d) driven by our businesses with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar ( USD\u201d), on the period-to-period performance results. The estimated impact of FX is calculated as the difference between the prior period results multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates to USD in the current period and the prior period results, multiplied by the average foreign currency rates to USD in the prior period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and segment financial information that may not be presented in our financial statements or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Certain of these financial measures are considered not in conformity with GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures\u201d) under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) rules. Specifically, we have referred to the following non-GAAP financial measures:\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total Segment Operating Income\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Net Income\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Free Cash Flow\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We have included the definitions of Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Segment EBITDA below in order to more fully define the components of certain non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying analysis of financial information. As described in Note 18, Segment Reporting\u201d in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report, we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA, and Segment Operating Income (Loss) is a component of the definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nWe define Segment Operating Income (Loss), a GAAP financial measure, as a segment's share of consolidated operating income. We define Total Segment Operating Income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Segment\nOperating Income (Loss) for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We use Segment Operating Income (Loss) for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA, a GAAP financial measure as a segment's share of consolidated operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a basis to internally evaluate the financial performance of our segments because we believe it reflects current core operating performance and provides an indicator of the segment's ability to generate cash. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\nWe define Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as consolidated net income before income tax provision, other non-operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, gain or loss on sale of a business and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our operating results, including underlying trends. In addition, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by many of our competitors. It is used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and others to value and compare the financial performance of companies in our industry. Therefore, we also believe that these measures, considered along with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results with the operating results of other companies.\nWe define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share ( Adjusted EPS\u201d), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as net income and earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\"), respectively, excluding the impact of remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, losses on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense on convertible notes, gain or loss on sale of a business and the impact of adopting the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act\u201d). We use Adjusted Net Income for the purpose of calculating Adjusted EPS. Management uses Adjusted EPS to assess total Company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends.\nWe define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of the Company's ability to generate cash for ongoing business operations and other capital deployment.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable with other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, the information contained in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included elsewhere in this report.\nFull Year 2018 Executive Highlights\nFinancial Highlights\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Growth\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,027,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per common share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of employees as of December 31\n</td> <td>4,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $220.1 million, or 12.2%, from 2017 to 2018. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher global demand across all segments, particularly in our Corporate Finance and FLC segments.\nSpecial charges\nThere were no special charges in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded special charges of $40.9 million related to certain targeted reductions of staff in areas of each segment to realign our workforce with current business demand. In addition, cost-cutting actions were taken in certain corporate departments where we were able to streamline support activities and reduce our real estate costs.\nGain on sale of business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our Ringtail\u00ae e-discovery software and related business (collectively, \"Ringtail\"). The net proceeds from the sale were $50.3 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $13.0 million.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nIn order to more effectively utilize the Company's growing cash balances, maintain financial flexibility and reduce cash interest, we issued $316.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2023 (\"2023 Convertible Notes\") and used a portion of the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to retire $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) during 2018. We recognized a $9.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2018, consisting primarily of a redemption premium of $6.0 million and a $3.1 million non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. The impact of early extinguishment of debt is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet income\nNet income increased $42.6 million, or 39.5%, from 2017 to 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher operating profits across all business segments and a $13.0 million gain related to the sale of Ringtail, which were partially offset by a $9.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and $3.0 million of non-cash interest on convertible notes. Net income in 2017 included a $44.9 million net tax benefit to reflect the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, which was nearly offset by $40.9 million in pre-tax special charges related to headcount and real estate reductions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $73.7 million, or 38.4%, from 2017 to 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was 13.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 10.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues across all business segments, which were partially offset by an increase in compensation, primarily related to higher variable compensation and an increase in billable headcount and higher selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses.\nEPS and Adjusted EPS\nEPS increased $1.18 to $3.93 in 2018 compared with $2.75 in 2017. 2018 EPS included a loss on early extinguishment of debt, which decreased EPS by $0.17 and non-cash interest on convertible notes, which decreased EPS by $0.06. These decreases were partially offset by a gain on the sale of Ringtail, which increased EPS by $0.16. EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the net tax benefit recorded to reflect the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, which increased EPS by $1.14, and a special charge related to headcount and real estate reductions, which reduced EPS by $0.70.\nAdjusted EPS increased $1.68 to $4.00 in 2018 compared with $2.32 in 2017, largely due to improved operating results.\nLiquidity and Capital Allocation\nCash balances increased by $122.1 million, or 64.3%, to $312.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities increased $83.0 million to $230.7 million in 2018 as compared with $147.6 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher cash collections resulting from higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for salaries and benefits and increased income tax payments. Days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) was 93 days as of December 31, 2018 and 91 days as of December 31, 2017.\nA portion of net cash provided by operating activities was used to repurchase and retire 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our Repurchase Program for an average price per share of $53.88, at a total cost of $40.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. We had $72.6 million remaining under the Repurchase Program to repurchase additional shares as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Convertible Notes to repurchase 0.2 million shares of our common stock at $76.51 per share for a total cost of $15.0 million. This was a separate repurchase transaction outside of the Repurchase Program.\nFree Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $198.4 million and $115.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as described above.\nHeadcount\nOur total headcount increased 3.4% from 4,609 as of December 31, 2017 to 4,768 as of December 31, 2018. The following table includes the net billable headcount additions (reductions) for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

expanded discussion of Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nSpecial Charges\nThere were no special charges during the year ended December 31, 2018. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $40.9 million. See Note 5, \"Special Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for expanded disclosure.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses increased $13.5 million, or 16.2%, to $96.6 million in 2018 from $83.1 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of special charges of $3.7 million recorded in 2017, unallocated corporate expenses increased by $17.1 million in 2018, or 21.6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense, higher costs for corporate and regional business development initiatives and the senior managing director meeting held in December 2018.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, increased $1.2 million to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in interest income resulting from investments of excess cash and a $0.3 million increase in net unrealized FX gains, partially offset by a $0.6 million loss on sale of investment in 2018. FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.8 million, or 7.1%, to $27.1 million in 2018 from $25.4 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects additional interest expense related to the 2023 Convertible Notes issuance that overlapped the period until the redemption of the 2022 Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower outstanding borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur income tax provision was $57.2 million for 2018 as compared with an income tax benefit of $20.9 million for 2017. Excluding the discrete income tax benefit in 2017 from the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.5% for 2018 and 27.6% for 2017. The 2018 rate was favorably impacted by reductions in the U.S. income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, which was partially offset by an unfavorable discrete tax adjustment relating to the sale of Ringtail\u00ae. The 2017 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an unusually high mix of foreign earnings compared with low U.S. earnings due to 2017 special charges.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with December 31, 2016\nRevenues and Operating Income\nSee Segment Results\u201d for an expanded discussion of Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nSpecial Charges\nSpecial charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $40.9 million. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $10.4 million. See Note 5, \"Special Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for an expanded disclosure.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased $5.0 million, or 5.7%, to $83.1 million in 2017 from $88.2 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of special charges of $3.7 million recorded in 2017, unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $8.1 million in 2017, or 9.3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower infrastructure department spend and lower executive compensation expenses, which were partially offset by higher outside legal expenses.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, decreased $6.7 million to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a net unrealized FX loss, which was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with a $4.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016. FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million, or 2.2%, to $25.4 million in 2017 from $24.8 million in 2016 due to the impact of a 0.7% increase in average interest rates on our borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility in 2017, partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding during 2017 as compared with 2016.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur income tax benefit was $20.9 million for 2017 as compared with an income tax provision of $42.3 million for 2016. Our 2017 income tax benefit included a discrete income tax benefit of $44.9 million related to the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.6% for 2017 as compared with an effective tax rate of 33.1% for 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate, excluding the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, declined related to the mix of higher foreign and U.S. state earnings in lower taxed jurisdictions as compared with the prior year.\nThe $44.9 million discrete adjustment for 2017 related to the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act impact includes the following:\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$65.1 million income tax benefit related to the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax liabilities from the previous U.S. federal tax rate of 35% to the newly enacted rate of 21%; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$18.7 million income tax expense related to a Transition Tax on a deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and profits as required under the new tax law.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nTotal Adjusted Segment EBITDA\nWe evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which is a GAAP measure.

Acquisition-related revenues contributed $9.5 million, or 2.0%, compared with 2017. Excluding the acquisition, revenues increased $73.0 million, or 15.1%. The revenue increase was largely driven by increased demand for our restructuring services and business transformation and transactions services, primarily in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d), along with higher realization due to mix of client engagements and staffing globally, which was partially offset by lower success fees.\nGross profit increased $46.8 million, or 28.7%, from 2017 to 2018. Gross profit margin increased 3.4 percentage points from 2017 to 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased utilization because of higher demand in our global restructuring services and business transformation and transaction services along with higher realization, partially offset by lower success fees.\nSG&A expenses increased $8.3 million, or 9.9%, from 2017 to 2018. SG&A expenses were 16.3% of revenues in 2018 compared with 17.4% in 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher bad debt, infrastructure support, recruiting and other general administrative expenses.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with December 31, 2016\nRevenues decreased $1.2 million, or 0.3%, from 2016 to 2017. Acquisition-related revenues contributed $10.1 million, or 2.1%, compared with 2016. Excluding the acquisition, revenues decreased $11.3 million, or 2.3%. This decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for restructuring practice offerings globally, which was partially offset by increased demand in the business transformation practice and higher success fees.\nGross profit decreased $12.9 million, or 7.3%, from 2016 to 2017. Gross profit margin decreased 2.6 percentage points from 2016 to 2017. This decrease was due to lower utilization driven by an increase in billable headcount, which was partially offset by higher success fees.\nSG&A expenses increased $2.2 million, or 2.7%, from 2016 to 2017, which included $1.2 million from a recent acquisition and the impact of higher bad debt expenses, partially offset by other general overhead expenses. Bad debt expenses in 2016 included collections of prior period write-offs.

Gross profit margin was consistent from 2017 to 2018. Higher margins from improved utilization were entirely offset by lower realization and higher variable compensation as a percentage of revenues.\nSG&A expenses increased $1.7 million, or 2.3%, from 2017 to 2018.

The increase in SG&A expenses was driven primarily by higher bad debt, compensation, depreciation and infrastructure support costs, which were partially offset by lower legal fees.\nTECHNOLOGY\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>177,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in revenues from prior year\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct cost of revenues\n</td> <td>111,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>59,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>170,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>170,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>14,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in segment operating income from prior year\n</td> <td>211.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-319.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>12,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Segment EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in gross profit from prior year\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin (2)\n</td> <td>40.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a percent of revenues\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of revenue-generating professionals (at period end) (3)\n</td> <td>306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in number of revenue-generating\nprofessionals from prior year\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Revenues less direct cost of revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Gross profit as a percent of revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Includes personnel involved in direct client assistance and revenue-generating consultants and excludes professionals employed on an as-needed basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with December 31, 2017\nRevenues increased $10.9 million, or 6.2%, from 2017 to 2018. The increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in both demand and pricing for consulting services, an increase in demand for hosting and higher realized pricing for M&A-related managed reviews. This increase was partially offset by lower pricing for hosting and $2.0 million in lower revenues from software licensing due to the Ringtail\u00ae divestiture. Higher consulting revenues were driven by increased demand for information governance, privacy and security services and global investigations.\nGross profit increased $1.3 million, or 1.7%, from 2017 to 2018. Gross profit margin decreased 1.7 percentage points to 40.2% from 2017 to 2018. The decrease in gross profit margin was largely due to a lower mix of high-margin hosting and software licensing revenues.\nSG&A expenses decreased $3.2 million, or 5.1%, from 2017 to 2018. SG&A expenses were 32.1% of revenues in 2018 compared with 35.9% in 2017. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower research and development expenses due to the Ringtail\u00ae divestiture, partially offset by an increase in other general administrative expenses. Research and development expenses related to software development were $8.7 million in 2018, a decline of $6.2 million, compared with $14.9 million in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with December 31, 2016\nRevenues decreased $2.9 million, or 1.6%, from 2016 to 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by lower pricing for hosting services as a result of a decline in legacy hosting matters at the end of their cycle, coupled with lower demand for managed review offerings, partially offset by higher demand for hosting services as a result of new engagements. Additionally, higher demand for consulting was driven by growth in new engagements, as well as growth in information governance engagements.\nGross profit increased $3.2 million, or 4.6%, from 2016 to 2017. Gross profit margin increased 2.4 percentage points to 41.9% from 2016 to 2017. This margin increase was due to higher pricing for consulting, higher demand for hosting and lower depreciation expense, which was partially offset by lower pricing for hosting services.\nSG&A expenses decreased $1.3 million, or 2.0%, from 2016 to 2017. SG&A expenses were 35.9% of revenues in 2017 compared with 36.1% in 2016. This decrease was due to lower salary and benefits and lower research and development expenses, partially offset by higher sales commissions. Research and development expenses related to software development were $14.9 million in 2017, a decline of $2.6 million, compared with $17.5 million in 2016.\nSTRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in revenues from prior year\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct cost of revenues\n</td> <td>135,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>46,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,947\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td>3,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>186,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>37,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in segment operating income from\nprior year\n</td> <td>183.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-43.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add back:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>5,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,403\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Segment EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in gross profit from prior year\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin (2)\n</td> <td>39.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a percent of revenues\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of revenue-generating professionals (at period end)\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage change in number of revenue-generating\nprofessionals from prior year\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-2.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Revenues less direct cost of revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Gross profit as a percent of revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with December 31, 2017\nRevenues increased $30.8 million, or 16.0%, from 2017 to 2018, which included a 1.6% estimated positive impact from FX. Excluding the estimated positive impact of FX, revenues increased $27.8 million or 14.4%. The increase was primarily due to higher project-based revenues in North America and higher retainer- and project-based revenues in EMEA. These increases were primarily driven by an increase in public affairs and financial communications services, as well as an increase in pass-through revenues.\nGross profit increased $16.8 million, or 23.8%, from 2017 to 2018. Gross profit margin increased 2.4 percentage points from 2017 to 2018. The increase in gross profit margin was due to lower fixed compensation as a percentage of revenues, partially offset by higher variable compensation and a higher proportion of lower margin pass-through revenues.\nSG&A expenses increased $0.8 million, or 1.8%, from 2017 to 2018. SG&A expenses were 20.9% of revenues in 2018 compared with 23.9% in 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher infrastructure support costs, bad debt and variable compensation, partially offset by lower expenses related to acquisition-related contingent consideration.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with December 31, 2016\nRevenues increased $1.3 million, or 0.7%, from 2016 to 2017. This increase was due to higher retainer-based revenues across all regions, which was partially offset by lower project income in North America, primarily in the financial communications practice.\nGross profit decreased $2.8 million, or 3.8%, from 2016 to 2017. Gross profit margin decreased 1.7 percentage points from 2016 to 2017. This decrease was primarily due to fewer large, high-margin engagements in North America, as well as higher compensation as a result of increased average billable headcount.\nSG&A expenses decreased $0.6 million, or 1.2%, from 2016 to 2017. SG&A expenses were 23.9% of revenues in 2017 compared with 24.3% in 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to lower staff costs, partially offset by higher travel and entertainment expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>233,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(40,638\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(117,519\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(140,934\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(125,310\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DSO\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have generally financed our day-to-day operations, capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash flows from operations. During the first quarter of our fiscal year, our cash needs generally exceed our cash flows from operations due to the payment of annual incentive compensation. Our operating cash flows generally exceed our cash needs subsequent to the second quarter of each year.\nOur operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of billed and unbilled accounts receivable, notes receivable from employees, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation expenses. The timing of billings and collections of receivables, as well as compensation and vendor payments, affect the changes in these balances.\nDSO is a performance measure used to assess how quickly revenues are collected by the Company. We calculate DSO at the end of each reporting period by dividing net accounts receivable reduced by billings in excess of services provided, by revenues for the quarter, adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates. We multiply the result by the number of days in the quarter.\nFree Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $198.4 million, $115.6 million and $204.6 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $83.0 million, or 56.3%, from 2017 to 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher cash collections, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for salaries and benefits and higher income tax payments. DSO was 93 days as of December 31, 2018 and 91 days as of December 31, 2017.\nNet cash provided by investing activities increased $59.4 million, or 146.1%, from 2017 to 2018. The Company received proceeds of $50.3 million from the sale of Ringtail\u00ae in 2018. Capital expenditures were $32.3 million for 2018 as compared with $32.0 million for 2017.\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased $23.4 million, or 16.6%, from 2017 to 2018. Cash used in financing activities in 2018 included the $300 million redemption of the 2022 Notes, $100 million of net repayments under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility (as amended and restated on November 30, 2018, the Credit Facility\u201d), $16.1 million payments of debt issue costs, redemption premium and other redemption costs, and $55.7 million in common stock repurchases. These cash outflows were partially offset by $316.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Convertible Notes and $38.5 million from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 included payments of $168.1 million for common stock repurchases and $5.2 million cash paid for acquisition-related contingent consideration, partially offset by $30.0 million of net borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $85.9 million, or 36.8%, from 2016 to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to higher compensation payments, including salaries, bonuses and severance, and lower cash collections. This was partially offset by lower income tax payments in the year ended December 31, 2017. DSO was 91 days as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $10.5 million, or 34.9%, from 2016 to 2017. Payment for the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a business completed in 2017 by our Corporate Finance segment was $8.9 million, net of cash received. Payment for the acquisition completed in 2016 by our Strategic Communications segment was $1.2 million, net of cash received. Capital expenditures were $32.0 million for 2017 as compared with $28.9 million for 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $15.6 million, or 12.5%, from 2016 to 2017. Cash used in financing activities in 2017 included $168.1 million in common stock repurchases and $5.2 million cash paid for acquisition-related contingent consideration, partially offset by $30.0 million of net borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility and the receipt of $2.8 million of refundable deposits related to one of our foreign entities. Net financing activities for 2016 included repayments of $130.0 million of borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility and $21.5 million in common stock repurchases, partially offset by $21.7 million in cash received from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plan and the receipt of $4.0 million of refundable deposits related to one of our foreign entities.\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, our capital resources included $312.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity of $549.0 million under a $550.0 million revolving line of credit under our Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility and $1.0 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced the availability of borrowings under the Credit Facility. We use letters of credit primarily in lieu of security deposits for our leased office facilities. The $550.0 million revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility includes a $75.0 million sublimit for borrowings in currencies other than USD, including the euro, British pound, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar.\nThe availability of borrowings, as well as issuances and extensions of letters of credit, under our Credit Facility is subject to specified conditions. We may choose to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility at any time before maturity without premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Credit Facility in USD, euro and British pound bear interest at an annual rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), plus an applicable margin or an alternative base rate plus an applicable margin. The alternative base rate means a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest in effect for such day as the prime rate announced by Bank of America, (2) the federal funds rate plus the sum of 50 basis points, and (3) the one-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points. Borrowings under the Credit Facility in Canadian dollars bear interest at an annual rate equal to the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate plus an applicable margin. Borrowings under the Credit Facility in Australian dollars bear interest at an annual rate equal to the Bank Bill Swap Reference Bid Rate plus an applicable margin. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of FTI Consulting and such domestic subsidiaries. Subject to certain conditions, at any time prior to maturity, we will be able to invite existing and new lenders to increase the size of the facility up to a maximum of $700.0 million.\nOur Credit Facility and other indebtedness outstanding from time to time contains or may contain covenants that, among other things, may limit our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends on our capital stock, make distributions or repurchases of our capital stock or make specified other restricted payments; consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; guarantee obligations of other entities or our foreign subsidiaries; enter into hedging agreements; enter into transactions with affiliates or related persons; or engage in any business other than consulting-related businesses. In addition, the Credit Facility includes a financial covenant that requires us not to exceed a maximum consolidated total net leverage ratio (the ratio of funded debt (less unrestricted cash up to $150.0 million) to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facility). As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Credit Facility and the indenture, dated as of August 20, 2018, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \"Indenture\") governing the 2023 Convertible Notes.\nFuture Capital Needs\nWe anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>operating and general corporate expenses relating to the operation of our businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital expenditures, primarily for information technology equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>debt service requirements, including interest payments on our long-term debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>compensation for designated executive management and senior managing directors under our various long-term incentive compensation programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>discretionary funding of our stock repurchase program;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>contingent obligations related to our acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>potential acquisitions of businesses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other known future contractual obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We currently anticipate capital expenditures of $31 million to $38 million to support our organization during 2019, including direct support for specific client engagements.

Our capital expenditure requirements may change if our staffing levels or technology needs change significantly from what we currently anticipate, if we are required to purchase additional equipment specifically to support new client engagements or for their purposes or if we pursue and complete additional acquisitions.\n2023 Convertible Notes\nOur 2023 Convertible Notes were issued pursuant to the Indenture. The 2023 Convertible Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 2.0% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2019. The 2023 Convertible Notes will mature on August 15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased. Upon conversion, the 2023 Convertible Notes may be settled, at our election in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock.\nEach $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes will initially be convertible into 9.8643 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $101.38 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2023, the 2023 Convertible Notes may be converted only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the Measurement Period\u201d) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $1,000 principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate in effect on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after May 15, 2023, until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of August 15, 2023, holders may convert their 2023 Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.\nWe may not redeem the 2023 Convertible Notes prior to the maturity date.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or part of their 2023 Convertible Notes in principal amounts of $1,000 or a multiple thereof. The fundamental change repurchase price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, in certain circumstances, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for any 2023 Convertible Notes converted in connection with a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture). See Note 1, \"Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 13, \"Long-Term Debt\" in Part II, Item 8 and \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report for a further discussion of the 2023 Convertible Notes.\nCash Flows\nFor the last several years, our cash flows from operations have exceeded our cash needs for capital expenditures and debt service requirements. We believe that our cash flows from operations, supplemented by short-term borrowings under our\nCredit Facility, as necessary, will provide adequate cash to fund our long-term cash needs from normal operations for the next 12 months or longer.\nOur conclusion that we will be able to fund our cash requirements by using existing capital resources and cash generated from operations does not take into account the impact of any future acquisitions, unexpected significant changes in number of employees or other unanticipated uses of cash. The anticipated cash needs of our business could change significantly if we pursue and complete additional business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that may have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business, including material negative changes in the operating performance or financial results of our business. Any of these events or circumstances, including any new business opportunities, could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources and could require us to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet those needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, is subject to a variety of factors that we cannot predict with certainty, including:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our future profitability;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the quality of our accounts receivable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our relative levels of debt and equity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the volatility and overall condition of the capital markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the market price of our securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Any new debt funding, if available, may be on terms less favorable to us than our Credit Facility or the Indenture that governs our 2023 Convertible Notes.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases, and we have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities.\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018. The information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based on the terms of the relevant agreements, appropriate classification of items under GAAP currently in effect and certain assumptions such as interest rates. Future events could cause actual payments to differ from these amounts.\nFuture contractual obligations related to our long-term debt assume that payments will be made based on the current payment schedule and that interest payments will be at their stated rates and exclude any additional revolving line of credit borrowings or repayments subsequent to December 31, 2018 and prior to the November 30, 2023 maturity date of our Credit Facility.

General operating expenses such as salaries, employee benefits and lease costs are, however, subject to normal inflationary pressures.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nGeneral. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services, goodwill, share-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on current facts and circumstances, historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenues are recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring goods or services promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under Revenue from Contracts with Customers: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenues when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. If, at the outset of an arrangement, we determine that a contract with enforceable rights and obligations does not exist, revenues are deferred until all criteria for an enforceable contract are met.\nWe generate the majority of our revenues by providing consulting services to our clients. Most of our consulting service contracts are based on one of the following types of arrangements:\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Time and expense arrangements require the client to pay us based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed-upon rates. We recognize revenues for these arrangements based on hours incurred and contracted rates utilizing a right-to-invoice practical expedient because we have a right to consideration for services completed to date. When a time and expense arrangement has a not-to-exceed or \"cap\" amount and we expect to perform work in excess of the cap, we recognize revenue up to the cap amount specified by the client, based on the efforts or hours incurred as a percentage of total efforts or hours expected to be incurred (i.e., proportional performance method). Certain time and materials arrangements may be subject to third-party approval, e.g., a court or other regulatory institution, with interim billing and payments made and received based upon preliminarily agreed-upon rates. In such cases, we record revenues for the portion of our services based on our assessment of the expected probability of amounts ultimately to be agreed upon by the court or regulator. These assessments are made on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the engagement, client economics, historical experience and other appropriate factors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fixed fee arrangements require the client to pay a pre-established fee in exchange for a predetermined set of professional services. We recognize revenues for these arrangements based on the proportional performance related to individual performance obligations within each arrangement, however, these arrangements generally have one performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Performance-based or contingent arrangements represent forms of variable consideration. In these arrangements, our fees are based on the attainment of contractually defined objectives with our client, such as completing a business transaction or assisting the client in achieving a specific business objective. When our performance obligation(s) are satisfied over time, we determine the transaction price based on the expected probability of achieving the agreed-upon outcome and recognize revenues earned to date by applying the proportional performance method. These arrangements include conditional payments, commonly referred to as success fees, which were previously recognized when the cash was collected.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, we generate certain revenues from our Technology segment that are based on units of data stored or processed. Unit-based revenues are recognized as services are provided, based on either the amount of data stored or processed, the number of concurrent users accessing the information, or the number of pages or images processed for a client, and agreed-upon per unit rates. We also generate revenues from our on-premise software licenses. Software license revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when the customer acceptance occurs, in accordance with the provision of the arrangements.\nCertain of our time and expense and fixed fee billing arrangements may include client incentives in the form of volume-based discounts, where if certain fee levels are reached, the client can receive future services at a discounted hourly rate.\nContracts with customers that have a prospective discounted pricing option based on predetermined volume thresholds are evaluated to determine whether they include a material right, which is an option that provides a customer the right to acquire free or discounted goods or services in the future. If the option provides a material right to the customer, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to the material right and defer revenues during the pre-discount period, compared with our previous practice of recognizing the reduction in revenues when customers became eligible to receive the volume discount.\nReimbursable expenses, including those relating to travel, out-of-pocket expenses, outside consultants and other outside service costs, are generally included in revenues, and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services in the period in which the expense is incurred.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Unbilled Services. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services for estimated losses resulting from disputes that affect our ability to fully collect our billed accounts receivable, potential fee reductions negotiated by clients or imposed by bankruptcy courts and the inability of clients to pay our fees. Even if a bankruptcy court approves our services, the court has the discretion to require us to refund all or a portion of our fees due to the outcome of the case or a variety of other factors. We estimate the allowance for all receivable risks by reviewing the status of each matter and recording reserves based on our experience and knowledge of the particular client and historical collection patterns. However, our actual experience may vary from our estimates. If the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability or unwillingness to pay our fees, or bankruptcy courts require us to refund certain fees, we may need to record additional allowances or write-offs in future periods. This risk related to a client's inability to pay may be partially mitigated to the extent that we may receive retainers from some of our clients prior to performing services.\nTiming of revenue recognition often differs from the timing of billing to our customers. Generally, we transfer goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or payment is due. If we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment for goods or services already provided, we record billed and unbilled receivables on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payment terms and conditions vary depending on the jurisdiction, market and type of service and whether regulatory or other third-party approvals are required. In addition, contracts may be negotiated per the client's request, or at times we are asked to execute contracts in a form provided by customers that might include different terms. Our standard contract terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 days where no contingencies exist.\nWe record adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services as a reduction in revenues when there are changes in estimates of fee reductions that may be imposed by bankruptcy courts and other regulatory institutions, for both billed and unbilled receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services is also adjusted after the related work has been billed to the client and we later discover that collectability is not reasonably assured. These adjustments are recorded to Selling, general and administrative expenses\u201d on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and totaled $17.9 million, $15.4 million and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the purchase price of acquired businesses in excess of the fair market value of net assets acquired at the date of acquisition. Other intangible assets may include trade names, customer relationships, non-competition agreements and software.\nWe test our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. Important factors we consider that could trigger an interim impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a significant market decline related to negative industry or economic trends; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our market capitalization relative to net carrying value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We assess our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision makers. Entities have an option, under certain circumstances, to perform a qualitative assessment regarding the reporting unit's fair value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test.\nIn the qualitative assessment, we consider various factors, events or circumstances, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance and other relevant reporting unit specific events. If, based on the qualitative assessment, an entity determines that it is not more likely than not\u201d that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we do not prepare a quantitative impairment test. If we determine otherwise, we will prepare a quantitative assessment for potential goodwill impairment.\nIn the quantitative assessment, we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of that reporting unit. We estimate fair value using a combination of an income approach (based on discounted cash flows) and market approaches, using appropriate weighting factors. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. However, if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe cash flows employed in the income approach are based on our most recent budgets, forecasts and business plans, as well as various growth rate assumptions for years beyond the current business plan period, discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) based on our assessment of the risk inherent in the future revenue streams and cash flows and our WACC. The WACC consists of (1) a risk-free rate of return, (2) an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable with our reporting units, (3) the current after-tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units, each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt, and (4) an appropriate size premium. In the market approach, we utilize market multiples derived from comparable guideline companies and comparable market transactions to the extent available. These valuations are based on estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and the determination of appropriate market comparables and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to such comparables.\nWe determine whether to perform qualitative assessment first or to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed with the quantitative goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units based on the headroom from the most recent quantitative tests and other events or changes in circumstances that could impact the fair value of the reporting units.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment and estimates. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved or market conditions significantly deteriorate, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment test or prior to that, if a triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment test is performed. It is not possible at this time to determine if any future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.\nIntangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. We amortize our acquired finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from five to 15 years.\nSignificant New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, New Accounting Standards\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.", "summary": "The report is a Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of FTI Consulting's financial condition and results of operations for the years ending December 31, 2018.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report\u201d). Historical results and any discussion of prospective results may not indicate our future performance.\nBusiness Overview\nFTI Consulting is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political and regulatory, reputational and transactional. Individually, each of our practices is staffed with experts recognized for the depth of their knowledge and a track record of making an impact. Collectively, FTI Consulting offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to assist clients across the business cycle, from proactive risk management to rapid response to unexpected events and dynamic environments.\nWe report financial results for the following five reportable segments:\nOur Corporate Finance & Restructuring ( Corporate Finance\u201d) segment focuses on the strategic, operational, financial and capital needs of our clients around the world and delivers a wide range of service offerings related to restructuring, business transformation and transaction support. Our restructuring practice includes corporate restructuring, including bankruptcy and interim management services. Our business transformation and transactions support practices include financings, mergers and acquisitions (\"M&A\"), M&A integration, valuations and tax advice, as well as financial, operational and performance improvement services.\nOur Forensic and Litigation Consulting ( FLC\u201d) segment provides law firms, companies, government clients and other interested parties with multidisciplinary, independent dispute advisory, investigations, data analytics, forensic accounting, business intelligence and risk mitigation services, as well as interim management and performance improvement services for our health solutions practice clients.\nOur Economic Consulting segment provides law firms, companies, government entities and other interested parties with analysis of complex economic issues for use in legal, regulatory and international arbitration proceedings, strategic decision making and public policy debates in the United States (\"U.S.\") and around the world.\nOur Technology segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of information governance and electronic discovery (\"e-discovery\") software, services and consulting support to companies, law firms, courts and government agencies worldwide. Our services allow our clients to control the risk and expense of e-discovery events more confidently, as well as manage their data in the context of compliance and risk.\nOur Strategic Communications segment designs and executes communications strategies for management teams and boards of directors to help them seize opportunities, manage financial, regulatory and reputational challenges, navigate market disruptions, articulate their brand, stake a competitive position, and preserve and grow their operations.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to both U.S. and global clients. Most of our services are rendered under time-and-expense arrangements that obligate the client to pay us a fee for the hours that we incur at agreed-upon rates. Under this arrangement, we typically bill our clients for reimbursable expenses, which may include the cost of producing our work product and other direct expenses that we incur on behalf of the client, such as travel costs. We also render services for which certain clients may be required to pay us a fixed fee or recurring retainer. These arrangements are generally cancelable at any time. Some of our engagements contain performance-based arrangements in which we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. This type of success fee may supplement a time-and-expense or fixed fee arrangement. Success fee revenues may cause variations in our revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance-based criteria. Seasonal factors, such as the timing of our employees' and clients' vacations and holidays, may impact the timing of our revenues across our segments.\nIn our Technology segment, certain clients are billed based on the amount of data stored on our electronic systems, the volume of information processed or the number of users licensing our Ringtail\u00ae software prior to its sale in September 2018, and our other software products. We licensed, and in some cases continue to license, certain products directly to end users, as well as indirectly through our channel partner relationships. Unit-based revenues are defined as revenues billed on a per item, per page or some other unit-based method and include revenues from data processing and hosting, software usage and software\nlicensing. Unit-based revenues include revenues associated with the software products that are made available to customers, either via a web browser ( on-demand\u201d) or installed at our customer or partner locations ( on-premise\u201d). On-demand revenues are charged on a unit or monthly basis and include, but are not limited to, processing and review related functions. On-premise revenues are composed of upfront license fees, with recurring support and maintenance.\nOur financial results are primarily driven by:\n \u2022 the number, size and type of engagements we secure; \n \u2022 the rate per hour or fixed charges we charge our clients for services; \n \u2022 the utilization rates of the revenue-generating professionals we employ; \n \u2022 the timing of revenue recognition related to revenues subject to certain performance-based contingencies; \n \u2022 the number of revenue-generating professionals; \n \u2022 licensing of our software products and other technology services; \n \u2022 the types of assignments we are working on at different times; \n \u2022 the length of the billing and collection cycles; and \n \u2022 the geographic locations of our clients or locations in which services are rendered.  We define acquisition growth as revenues of acquired companies in the first 12 months following the effective date of an acquisition. Our definition of organic growth is the change in revenues, excluding the impact of all such acquisitions.\nWhen significant, we identify the estimated impact of foreign currency translation ( FX\u201d) driven by our businesses with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar ( USD\u201d), on the period-to-period performance results. The estimated impact of FX is calculated as the difference between the prior period results multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates to USD in the current period and the prior period results, multiplied by the average foreign currency rates to USD in the prior period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and segment financial information that may not be presented in our financial statements or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Certain of these financial measures are considered not in conformity with GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures\u201d) under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) rules. Specifically, we have referred to the following non-GAAP financial measures:\n \u2022 Total Segment Operating Income \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA \n \u2022 Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA Margin \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income \n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share \n \u2022 Free Cash Flow  We have included the definitions of Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Segment EBITDA below in order to more fully define the components of certain non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying analysis of financial information. As described in Note 18, Segment Reporting\u201d in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report, we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA, and Segment Operating Income (Loss) is a component of the definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nWe define Segment Operating Income (Loss), a GAAP financial measure, as a segment's share of consolidated operating income. We define Total Segment Operating Income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Segment\nOperating Income (Loss) for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We use Segment Operating Income (Loss) for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA, a GAAP financial measure as a segment's share of consolidated operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a basis to internally evaluate the financial performance of our segments because we believe it reflects current core operating performance and provides an indicator of the segment's ability to generate cash. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\nWe define Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as consolidated net income before income tax provision, other non-operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, gain or loss on sale of a business and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our operating results, including underlying trends. In addition, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by many of our competitors. It is used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and others to value and compare the financial performance of companies in our industry. Therefore, we also believe that these measures, considered along with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results with the operating results of other companies.\nWe define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share ( Adjusted EPS\u201d), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as net income and earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\"), respectively, excluding the impact of remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, losses on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense on convertible notes, gain or loss on sale of a business and the impact of adopting the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act\u201d). We use Adjusted Net Income for the purpose of calculating Adjusted EPS. Management uses Adjusted EPS to assess total Company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends.\nWe define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of the Company's ability to generate cash for ongoing business operations and other capital deployment.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable with other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, the information contained in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included elsewhere in this report.\nFull Year 2018 Executive Highlights\nFinancial Highlights\n\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $220.1 million, or 12.2%, from 2017 to 2018. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher global demand across all segments, particularly in our Corporate Finance and FLC segments.\nSpecial charges\nThere were no special charges in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded special charges of $40.9 million related to certain targeted reductions of staff in areas of each segment to realign our workforce with current business demand. In addition, cost-cutting actions were taken in certain corporate departments where we were able to streamline support activities and reduce our real estate costs.\nGain on sale of business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our Ringtail\u00ae e-discovery software and related business (collectively, \"Ringtail\"). The net proceeds from the sale were $50.3 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $13.0 million.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nIn order to more effectively utilize the Company's growing cash balances, maintain financial flexibility and reduce cash interest, we issued $316.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2023 (\"2023 Convertible Notes\") and used a portion of the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to retire $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) during 2018. We recognized a $9.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2018, consisting primarily of a redemption premium of $6.0 million and a $3.1 million non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. The impact of early extinguishment of debt is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet income\nNet income increased $42.6 million, or 39.5%, from 2017 to 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher operating profits across all business segments and a $13.0 million gain related to the sale of Ringtail, which were partially offset by a $9.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and $3.0 million of non-cash interest on convertible notes. Net income in 2017 included a $44.9 million net tax benefit to reflect the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, which was nearly offset by $40.9 million in pre-tax special charges related to headcount and real estate reductions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $73.7 million, or 38.4%, from 2017 to 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was 13.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 10.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues across all business segments, which were partially offset by an increase in compensation, primarily related to higher variable compensation and an increase in billable headcount and higher selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses.\nEPS and Adjusted EPS\nEPS increased $1.18 to $3.93 in 2018 compared with $2.75 in 2017. 2018 EPS included a loss on early extinguishment of debt, which decreased EPS by $0.17 and non-cash interest on convertible notes, which decreased EPS by $0.06. These decreases were partially offset by a gain on the sale of Ringtail, which increased EPS by $0.16. EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the net tax benefit recorded to reflect the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, which increased EPS by $1.14, and a special charge related to headcount and real estate reductions, which reduced EPS by $0.70.\nAdjusted EPS increased $1.68 to $4.00 in 2018 compared with $2.32 in 2017, largely due to improved operating results.\nLiquidity and Capital Allocation\nCash balances increased by $122.1 million, or 64.3%, to $312.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities increased $83.0 million to $230.7 million in 2018 as compared with $147.6 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher cash collections resulting from higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for salaries and benefits and increased income tax payments. Days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) was 93 days as of December 31, 2018 and 91 days as of December 31, 2017.\nA portion of net cash provided by operating activities was used to repurchase and retire 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our Repurchase Program for an average price per share of $53.88, at a total cost of $40.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. We had $72.6 million remaining under the Repurchase Program to repurchase additional shares as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Convertible Notes to repurchase 0.2 million shares of our common stock at $76.51 per share for a total cost of $15.0 million. This was a separate repurchase transaction outside of the Repurchase Program.\nFree Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $198.4 million and $115.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as described above.\nHeadcount\nOur total headcount increased 3.4% from 4,609 as of December 31, 2017 to 4,768 as of December 31, 2018. The following table includes the net billable headcount additions (reductions) for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSegment and Consolidated Operating Results:\n\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\nReconciliation of Net Income and EPS to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS:\n\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow:\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with December 31, 2017\nRevenues and Operating Income\nSee Segment Results\u201d for an expanded discussion of Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nSpecial Charges\nThere were no special charges during the year ended December 31, 2018. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $40.9 million. See Note 5, \"Special Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for expanded disclosure.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses increased $13.5 million, or 16.2%, to $96.6 million in 2018 from $83.1 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of special charges of $3.7 million recorded in 2017, unallocated corporate expenses increased by $17.1 million in 2018, or 21.6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense, higher costs for corporate and regional business development initiatives and the senior managing director meeting held in December 2018.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, increased $1.2 million to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in interest income resulting from investments of excess cash and a $0.3 million increase in net unrealized FX gains, partially offset by a $0.6 million loss on sale of investment in 2018. FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.8 million, or 7.1%, to $27.1 million in 2018 from $25.4 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects additional interest expense related to the 2023 Convertible Notes issuance that overlapped the period until the redemption of the 2022 Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower outstanding borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur income tax provision was $57.2 million for 2018 as compared with an income tax benefit of $20.9 million for 2017. Excluding the discrete income tax benefit in 2017 from the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.5% for 2018 and 27.6% for 2017. The 2018 rate was favorably impacted by reductions in the U.S. income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, which was partially offset by an unfavorable discrete tax adjustment relating to the sale of Ringtail\u00ae. The 2017 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an unusually high mix of foreign earnings compared with low U.S. earnings due to 2017 special charges.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with December 31, 2016\nRevenues and Operating Income\nSee Segment Results\u201d for an expanded discussion of Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nSpecial Charges\nSpecial charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $40.9 million. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $10.4 million. See Note 5, \"Special Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for an expanded disclosure.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased $5.0 million, or 5.7%, to $83.1 million in 2017 from $88.2 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of special charges of $3.7 million recorded in 2017, unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $8.1 million in 2017, or 9.3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower infrastructure department spend and lower executive compensation expenses, which were partially offset by higher outside legal expenses.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, decreased $6.7 million to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a net unrealized FX loss, which was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with a $4.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016. FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million, or 2.2%, to $25.4 million in 2017 from $24.8 million in 2016 due to the impact of a 0.7% increase in average interest rates on our borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility in 2017, partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding during 2017 as compared with 2016.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur income tax benefit was $20.9 million for 2017 as compared with an income tax provision of $42.3 million for 2016. Our 2017 income tax benefit included a discrete income tax benefit of $44.9 million related to the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.6% for 2017 as compared with an effective tax rate of 33.1% for 2016.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Annual Report\u201d). Historical results and any discussion of prospective results may not indicate our future performance.\nBusiness Overview\nFTI Consulting is a global business advisory firm dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political and regulatory, reputational and transactional. Individually, each of our practices is staffed with experts recognized for the depth of their knowledge and a track record of making an impact. Collectively, FTI Consulting offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to assist clients across the business cycle, from proactive risk management to rapid response to unexpected events and dynamic environments.\nWe report financial results for the following five reportable segments:\nOur Corporate Finance & Restructuring ( Corporate Finance\u201d) segment focuses on the strategic, operational, financial and capital needs of our clients around the world and delivers a wide range of service offerings related to restructuring, business transformation and transaction support. Our restructuring practice includes corporate restructuring, including bankruptcy and interim management services. Our business transformation and transactions support practices include financings, mergers and acquisitions (\"M&A\"), M&A integration, valuations and tax advice, as well as financial, operational and performance improvement services.\nOur Forensic and Litigation Consulting ( FLC\u201d) segment provides law firms, companies, government clients and other interested parties with multidisciplinary, independent dispute advisory, investigations, data analytics, forensic accounting, business intelligence and risk mitigation services, as well as interim management and performance improvement services for our health solutions practice clients.\nOur Economic Consulting segment provides law firms, companies, government entities and other interested parties with analysis of complex economic issues for use in legal, regulatory and international arbitration proceedings, strategic decision making and public policy debates in the United States (\"U.S.\") and around the world.\nOur Technology segment offers a comprehensive portfolio of information governance and electronic discovery (\"e-discovery\") software, services and consulting support to companies, law firms, courts and government agencies worldwide. Our services allow our clients to control the risk and expense of e-discovery events more confidently, as well as manage their data in the context of compliance and risk.\nOur Strategic Communications segment designs and executes communications strategies for management teams and boards of directors to help them seize opportunities, manage financial, regulatory and reputational challenges, navigate market disruptions, articulate their brand, stake a competitive position, and preserve and grow their operations.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to both U.S. and global clients. Most of our services are rendered under time-and-expense arrangements that obligate the client to pay us a fee for the hours that we incur at agreed-upon rates. Under this arrangement, we typically bill our clients for reimbursable expenses, which may include the cost of producing our work product and other direct expenses that we incur on behalf of the client, such as travel costs. We also render services for which certain clients may be required to pay us a fixed fee or recurring retainer. These arrangements are generally cancelable at any time. Some of our engagements contain performance-based arrangements in which we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. This type of success fee may supplement a time-and-expense or fixed fee arrangement. Success fee revenues may cause variations in our revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance-based criteria. Seasonal factors, such as the timing of our employees' and clients' vacations and holidays, may impact the timing of our revenues across our segments.\nIn our Technology segment, certain clients are billed based on the amount of data stored on our electronic systems, the volume of information processed or the number of users licensing our Ringtail\u00ae software prior to its sale in September 2018, and our other software products. We licensed, and in some cases continue to license, certain products directly to end users, as well as indirectly through our channel partner relationships. Unit-based revenues are defined as revenues billed on a per item, per page or some other unit-based method and include revenues from data processing and hosting, software usage and software\nlicensing. Unit-based revenues include revenues associated with the software products that are made available to customers, either via a web browser ( on-demand\u201d) or installed at our customer or partner locations ( on-premise\u201d). On-demand revenues are charged on a unit or monthly basis and include, but are not limited to, processing and review related functions. On-premise revenues are composed of upfront license fees, with recurring support and maintenance.\nOur financial results are primarily driven by:\n \u2022 the number, size and type of engagements we secure; \n \u2022 the rate per hour or fixed charges we charge our clients for services; \n \u2022 the utilization rates of the revenue-generating professionals we employ; \n \u2022 the timing of revenue recognition related to revenues subject to certain performance-based contingencies; \n \u2022 the number of revenue-generating professionals; \n \u2022 licensing of our software products and other technology services; \n \u2022 the types of assignments we are working on at different times; \n \u2022 the length of the billing and collection cycles; and \n \u2022 the geographic locations of our clients or locations in which services are rendered.  We define acquisition growth as revenues of acquired companies in the first 12 months following the effective date of an acquisition. Our definition of organic growth is the change in revenues, excluding the impact of all such acquisitions.\nWhen significant, we identify the estimated impact of foreign currency translation ( FX\u201d) driven by our businesses with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar ( USD\u201d), on the period-to-period performance results. The estimated impact of FX is calculated as the difference between the prior period results multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates to USD in the current period and the prior period results, multiplied by the average foreign currency rates to USD in the prior period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and segment financial information that may not be presented in our financial statements or prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). Certain of these financial measures are considered not in conformity with GAAP (\"non-GAAP financial measures\u201d) under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) rules. Specifically, we have referred to the following non-GAAP financial measures:\n \u2022 Total Segment Operating Income \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA \n \u2022 Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA Margin \n \u2022 Adjusted Net Income \n \u2022 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share \n \u2022 Free Cash Flow  We have included the definitions of Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Segment EBITDA below in order to more fully define the components of certain non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying analysis of financial information. As described in Note 18, Segment Reporting\u201d in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report, we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA, and Segment Operating Income (Loss) is a component of the definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nWe define Segment Operating Income (Loss), a GAAP financial measure, as a segment's share of consolidated operating income. We define Total Segment Operating Income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Segment\nOperating Income (Loss) for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We use Segment Operating Income (Loss) for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA, a GAAP financial measure as a segment's share of consolidated operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a basis to internally evaluate the financial performance of our segments because we believe it reflects current core operating performance and provides an indicator of the segment's ability to generate cash. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues.\nWe define Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as consolidated net income before income tax provision, other non-operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, gain or loss on sale of a business and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our operating results, including underlying trends. In addition, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by many of our competitors. It is used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and others to value and compare the financial performance of companies in our industry. Therefore, we also believe that these measures, considered along with corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results with the operating results of other companies.\nWe define Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share ( Adjusted EPS\u201d), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as net income and earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\"), respectively, excluding the impact of remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges, losses on early extinguishment of debt, non-cash interest expense on convertible notes, gain or loss on sale of a business and the impact of adopting the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act\u201d). We use Adjusted Net Income for the purpose of calculating Adjusted EPS. Management uses Adjusted EPS to assess total Company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provide management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends.\nWe define Free Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities less cash payments for purchases of property and equipment. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of the Company's ability to generate cash for ongoing business operations and other capital deployment.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable with other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, the information contained in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included elsewhere in this report.\nFull Year 2018 Executive Highlights\nFinancial Highlights\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Growth\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollar amounts in thousands, except per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,027,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,807,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>265,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>192,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted earnings per common share - diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total number of employees as of December 31\n</td> <td>4,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues increased $220.1 million, or 12.2%, from 2017 to 2018. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher global demand across all segments, particularly in our Corporate Finance and FLC segments.\nSpecial charges\nThere were no special charges in 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded special charges of $40.9 million related to certain targeted reductions of staff in areas of each segment to realign our workforce with current business demand. In addition, cost-cutting actions were taken in certain corporate departments where we were able to streamline support activities and reduce our real estate costs.\nGain on sale of business\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold our Ringtail\u00ae e-discovery software and related business (collectively, \"Ringtail\"). The net proceeds from the sale were $50.3 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $13.0 million.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt\nIn order to more effectively utilize the Company's growing cash balances, maintain financial flexibility and reduce cash interest, we issued $316.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2.0% convertible senior notes due 2023 (\"2023 Convertible Notes\") and used a portion of the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to retire $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d) during 2018. We recognized a $9.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2018, consisting primarily of a redemption premium of $6.0 million and a $3.1 million non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. The impact of early extinguishment of debt is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet income\nNet income increased $42.6 million, or 39.5%, from 2017 to 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher operating profits across all business segments and a $13.0 million gain related to the sale of Ringtail, which were partially offset by a $9.1 million loss on early extinguishment of debt and $3.0 million of non-cash interest on convertible notes. Net income in 2017 included a $44.9 million net tax benefit to reflect the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, which was nearly offset by $40.9 million in pre-tax special charges related to headcount and real estate reductions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $73.7 million, or 38.4%, from 2017 to 2018. Adjusted EBITDA was 13.1% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared with 10.6% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to higher revenues across all business segments, which were partially offset by an increase in compensation, primarily related to higher variable compensation and an increase in billable headcount and higher selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses.\nEPS and Adjusted EPS\nEPS increased $1.18 to $3.93 in 2018 compared with $2.75 in 2017. 2018 EPS included a loss on early extinguishment of debt, which decreased EPS by $0.17 and non-cash interest on convertible notes, which decreased EPS by $0.06. These decreases were partially offset by a gain on the sale of Ringtail, which increased EPS by $0.16. EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the net tax benefit recorded to reflect the impact of adopting the 2017 Tax Act, which increased EPS by $1.14, and a special charge related to headcount and real estate reductions, which reduced EPS by $0.70.\nAdjusted EPS increased $1.68 to $4.00 in 2018 compared with $2.32 in 2017, largely due to improved operating results.\nLiquidity and Capital Allocation\nCash balances increased by $122.1 million, or 64.3%, to $312.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities increased $83.0 million to $230.7 million in 2018 as compared with $147.6 million in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher cash collections resulting from higher revenues, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for salaries and benefits and increased income tax payments. Days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) was 93 days as of December 31, 2018 and 91 days as of December 31, 2017.\nA portion of net cash provided by operating activities was used to repurchase and retire 0.8 million shares of our common stock under our Repurchase Program for an average price per share of $53.88, at a total cost of $40.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. We had $72.6 million remaining under the Repurchase Program to repurchase additional shares as of December 31, 2018. Additionally, we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Convertible Notes to repurchase 0.2 million shares of our common stock at $76.51 per share for a total cost of $15.0 million. This was a separate repurchase transaction outside of the Repurchase Program.\nFree Cash Flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $198.4 million and $115.6 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, as described above.\nHeadcount\nOur total headcount increased 3.4% from 4,609 as of December 31, 2017 to 4,768 as of December 31, 2018. The following table includes the net billable headcount additions (reductions) for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

expanded discussion of Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nSpecial Charges\nThere were no special charges during the year ended December 31, 2018. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $40.9 million. See Note 5, \"Special Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for expanded disclosure.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses increased $13.5 million, or 16.2%, to $96.6 million in 2018 from $83.1 million in 2017. Excluding the impact of special charges of $3.7 million recorded in 2017, unallocated corporate expenses increased by $17.1 million in 2018, or 21.6%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in variable compensation expense, higher costs for corporate and regional business development initiatives and the senior managing director meeting held in December 2018.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, increased $1.2 million to $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in interest income resulting from investments of excess cash and a $0.3 million increase in net unrealized FX gains, partially offset by a $0.6 million loss on sale of investment in 2018. FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $1.8 million, or 7.1%, to $27.1 million in 2018 from $25.4 million in 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects additional interest expense related to the 2023 Convertible Notes issuance that overlapped the period until the redemption of the 2022 Notes, partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower outstanding borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur income tax provision was $57.2 million for 2018 as compared with an income tax benefit of $20.9 million for 2017. Excluding the discrete income tax benefit in 2017 from the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.5% for 2018 and 27.6% for 2017. The 2018 rate was favorably impacted by reductions in the U.S. income tax rate as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, which was partially offset by an unfavorable discrete tax adjustment relating to the sale of Ringtail\u00ae. The 2017 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by an unusually high mix of foreign earnings compared with low U.S. earnings due to 2017 special charges.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared with December 31, 2016\nRevenues and Operating Income\nSee Segment Results\u201d for an expanded discussion of Revenues and Adjusted Segment EBITDA.\nSpecial Charges\nSpecial charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $40.9 million. Special charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $10.4 million. See Note 5, \"Special Charges\" in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for an expanded disclosure.\nUnallocated Corporate Expenses\nUnallocated corporate expenses decreased $5.0 million, or 5.7%, to $83.1 million in 2017 from $88.2 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of special charges of $3.7 million recorded in 2017, unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $8.1 million in 2017, or 9.3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower infrastructure department spend and lower executive compensation expenses, which were partially offset by higher outside legal expenses.\nInterest Income and Other\nInterest income and other, which includes FX gains and losses, decreased $6.7 million to $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a net unrealized FX loss, which was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with a $4.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016. FX gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include cash, as well as third-party and intercompany receivables and payables.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million, or 2.2%, to $25.4 million in 2017 from $24.8 million in 2016 due to the impact of a 0.7% increase in average interest rates on our borrowings under our senior secured bank revolving credit facility in 2017, partially offset by lower average borrowings outstanding during 2017 as compared with 2016.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nOur income tax benefit was $20.9 million for 2017 as compared with an income tax provision of $42.3 million for 2016. Our 2017 income tax benefit included a discrete income tax benefit of $44.9 million related to the adoption of the 2017 Tax Act on December 22, 2017. Excluding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, our effective tax rate was 27.6% for 2017 as compared with an effective tax rate of 33.1% for 2016.
