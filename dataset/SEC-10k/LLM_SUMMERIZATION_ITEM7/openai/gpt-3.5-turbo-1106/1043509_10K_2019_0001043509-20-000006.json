Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial and statistical data contained in the following discussion for all periods presented reflects our December 31, 2019 classification of dealerships between continuing and discontinued operations in accordance with Presentation of Financial Statements\u201d in the Accounting Standards Codification (the ASC\u201d). For comparison and discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 ( 2018\u201d) compared to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 ( 2017\u201d), please refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018.\nUnless otherwise noted, we present the discussion in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on a consolidated basis. To the extent that differences among reportable segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the differences are discussed separately.\nUnless otherwise noted, all discussion of increases or decreases are for the year ended December 31, 2019 ( 2019\u201d) compared to 2018. The following discussion of new vehicles, used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, parts, service and collision repair, finance, insurance and other, net are on a same store basis, except where otherwise noted. All currently operating stores (both our franchised dealerships and EchoPark stores) are included within the same store group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of the store's opening or acquisition. During 2019, we opened one new EchoPark store, which is included in reported amounts for 2019, but is excluded from same store reporting for all periods. During 2018, we opened one new manufacturer-awarded open point franchised dealership, which is included in reported amounts for 2019 and 2018, but is excluded from same store reporting for all periods. In addition, during 2018, we opened three new EchoPark stores, which are included in reported amounts for all periods and two of which are included in same store reporting for 2019 compared to 2018.\nWe disposed of one luxury franchised dealership and nine mid-line import franchised dealerships in 2019, and had no franchises held for sale as of December 31, 2019. We disposed of two luxury franchised dealerships and five mid-line import franchised dealerships, terminated one luxury franchised dealership and closed three EchoPark stores and one previously acquired pre-owned vehicle store in 2018. The results of operations of these disposed dealership franchises and closed stores are included in reported amounts below and in continuing operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Dispositions that occurred subsequent to March 31, 2014 have not been reclassified to discontinued operations since they did not meet the criteria for reclassification under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for tabular disclosure of the effects of disposed dealership franchises that remain in continuing operations.\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States (as measured by total revenue). As a result of the way we manage our business, we had two reportable segments as of December 31, 2019: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment and (2) the EchoPark Segment. For management and operational reporting purposes, we group certain businesses together that share management and inventory (principally used vehicles) into stores.\u201d As of December 31, 2019, we operated 86 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment and nine stores in the EchoPark Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists of 99 new vehicle franchises (representing 21 different brands of cars and light trucks) and 15 collision repair centers in 12 states.\nThe Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive services, including (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement parts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, Fixed Operations\u201d); and (3) arrangement of extended warranties, service contracts, financing, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, finance and insurance\u201d or F&I\u201d) for our customers. The EchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges F&I product sales for our customers in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations. Our EchoPark business operates independently from our franchised dealerships business. Sales operations in our first EchoPark market in Denver, Colorado began in the fourth quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2019, we had three EchoPark stores in operation in Colorado, four in Texas, one in North Carolina and one in California. By the end of 2020, we expect to open three additional EchoPark stores. We believe that the continued expansion of our EchoPark business will provide long-term benefits to the Company, our stockholders and our guests.\nExecutive Summary\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry's total new vehicle unit sales volume was approximately 17.0 million vehicles and 17.2 million vehicles in 2019 and 2018, respectively, according to the Power Information Network ( PIN\u201d) from J.D. Power.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor 2020, analysts' industry expectation for the new vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales ( SAAR\u201d) range from 16.0 million to 17.0 million vehicles, a decrease of 4.8% or flat, respectively, compared to the industry volume level in 2019. We estimate the 2020 new vehicle SAAR will be between 16.5 million and 17.0 million vehicles. Changes in consumer confidence, replacement demand as a result of natural disasters, availability of consumer financing, manufacturer inventory production levels or incentive levels from automotive manufacturers could cause actual the 2020 new vehicle SAAR to vary from expectations. Many factors, including brand and geographic concentrations as well as the industry sales mix between retail and fleet new vehicle unit sales volume, have caused our past results to differ from the industry's overall trend. Our current operational goal focuses on growing our retail new vehicle sales, as opposed to fleet new vehicle sales, and, as a result, we believe it is appropriate to compare our retail new vehicle unit sales volume to the retail new vehicle SAAR (which excludes fleet new vehicle sales). According to PIN from J.D. Power, industry retail new vehicle unit sales volume decreased 3.6%, to 13.5 million vehicles, in 2019, from 14.0 million vehicles in 2018.\nOn September 16, 2019, the United Auto Workers union began a strike at General Motors' manufacturing facilities. The strike ended on October 25, 2019 and had minimal impact on our operations. The strike did not limit the rate of new vehicle sales and Fixed Operations revenues at our General Motors franchises. As of December 31, 2019, we operated nine General Motors franchises.\nAs a result of the disposition, termination or closure of several franchised dealership stores since December 31, 2018, the change in consolidated reported amounts from period to period may not be indicative of the future operational or financial performance of our current group of operating stores. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of increases or decreases are for 2019 compared to 2018. The following discussion of new vehicles, used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, parts, service and collision repair, and finance, insurance and other, net is on a same store basis, except where otherwise noted. All currently operating stores (both our franchised dealerships and EchoPark stores) are included within the same store group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of the store's opening or acquisition.\nFranchised Dealerships Segment\nNew vehicle revenue increased 4.2% in 2019, due to higher average selling prices and a 0.6% increase in new vehicle unit sales volume. New vehicle gross profit increased 1.0% in 2019 due to the 0.6% increase in new vehicle unit sales volume and an increase in new vehicle gross profit per unit, which increased $8 per unit, or 0.4%, to $2,083 per unit. While the availability of vehicle pricing information to consumers, increased competition for sales between similar branded dealerships and higher overall inventory levels have resulted in downward pressure on new vehicle pricing, we believe that new vehicle gross profit per unit has stabilized.\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 8.8% in 2019, driven by a 7.7% increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Retail used vehicle gross profit increased 5.8% in 2019, despite a decrease in retail used vehicle gross profit per unit of $23 per unit, or 1.8%, to $1,272 per unit. Our wholesale vehicle gross loss decreased approximately $6.8 million, or 66.0%, during 2019, primarily driven by reaffirming our policy of wholesaling aged or undesirable units at auction in a timelier manner, thereby reducing the risk of wholesale vehicle gross loss and improving inventory levels and quality. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our reported franchised dealerships used vehicle inventory days' supply was approximately 28 and 30 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations revenue increased 5.0% and Fixed Operations gross profit increased 6.0%. Fixed Operations gross margin increased 50 basis points, to 48.9%, in 2019, driven primarily by higher levels of customer pay revenue and an increase in customer pay gross margin.\nF&I revenue increased 10.3% in 2019, driven by an increase in F&I gross profit per retail unit. F&I gross profit per retail unit increased $96 per unit, or 6.5%, to $1,583 per unit, in 2019. We believe that our proprietary software applications, playbook processes and customer-centric selling approach enable us to optimize F&I gross profit and penetration rates (the number of F&I products sold per vehicle) across our F&I product lines. We believe that we will continue to increase revenue in this area as we refine our processes, train our associates and continue to sell a high volume of retail new and used vehicles at our stores.\nEchoPark Segment\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 43.0% and F&I revenue increased 61.9% in 2019, driven primarily by a 45.7% increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume in 2019. Combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit increased\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n$279 per unit, or 14.6%, to $2,187 per unit in 2019. The growth in combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit was primarily due to increased F&I product penetration rates.\nWholesale vehicle gross loss increased approximately $0.8 million, or 156.8%, in 2019, primarily due to a shift in our strategy around wholesaling vehicles that we obtain via trade-in from customers. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our used vehicle inventory days' supply at our EchoPark stores was approximately 33 and 34 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations revenue increased approximately $8.4 million, or 58.2%, in 2019, primarily due to higher vehicle unit sales volume (and resulting inventory reconditioning requirements). Fixed Operations gross profit decreased approximately $2.6 million, or 141.6%, in 2019, due to a shift in inventory strategy during the second quarter of 2018 resulting in less internal reconditioning work per vehicle and the decision to no longer provide customer pay parts and service work at our EchoPark stores.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New vehicles </td> <td>46.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>53.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicles </td> <td>33.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale vehicles </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parts, service and collision repair </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance, insurance and other, net </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, floor plan </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, other, net </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes for continuing operations - (benefit) expense </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nNew Vehicles - Consolidated\nNew vehicle revenues include the sale of new vehicles to retail customers, as well as the sale of fleet vehicles. New vehicle revenues and gross profit can be influenced by vehicle manufacturer incentives to consumers (which vary from cash-back incentives to low interest rate financing, among other things), the availability of consumer credit and the level and type of manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, as well as manufacturers providing adequate inventory allocations to our dealerships to meet customer demands. The automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand, both within specific brands and in the industry as a whole. As an automotive retailer, we seek to mitigate the effects of this sales cycle by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships. Our brand\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ndiversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower-priced/economy vehicles to luxury vehicles.\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry's new vehicle unit sales volume below reflects all brands marketed or sold in the United States. This industry sales volume includes brands we do not sell and markets in which we do not operate, therefore our new vehicle unit sales volume may not trend directly in line with the industry unit sales volume. We believe that the retail new vehicle SAAR is a more meaningful metric for comparing our new vehicle unit sales volume to the industry due to our minimal fleet vehicle business.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions of vehicles) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. industry volume - Retail (1) </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. industry volume - Fleet </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. industry volume - Total (1) </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Source: PIN from J.D.

Dealerships Segment and EchoPark Segment sections, respectively, below.\nFixed Operations - Consolidated\nParts, service and collision repair revenues consist of customer requested repair orders ( customer pay\u201d), warranty repairs, wholesale parts and internal, sublet and other. Parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs, available service capacity, vehicle quality, manufacturer recalls, customer loyalty and prepaid or manufacturer-paid maintenance programs. Internal, sublet and other primarily relates to preparation and reconditioning work performed on vehicles that are later sold to customers. When that work is performed by one of our dealerships or stores, the work is classified as internal. In the event the work is performed by a third party on our behalf, it is classified as sublet.\nWe believe that, over time, vehicle quality will continue to improve, but vehicle complexity and the associated demand for repairs by qualified technicians at franchised dealerships will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality. We also believe that, over the long term, we have the ability to continue to add service capacity at our dealerships and stores to further increase Fixed Operations revenues. Manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty or complimentary maintenance program coverage. These factors, over the long term, combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on CPO vehicles, should facilitate long-term growth in our parts and service business. Barriers to long-term growth may include reductions in the rate paid by manufacturers to dealers for warranty work performed, as well as the improved quality of vehicles that may affect the level and frequency of future customer pay or warranty-related revenues.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table

for vehicles, and sales of other aftermarket products. In connection with vehicle financing, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products and insurance contracts, we receive commissions from the providers for originating contracts. F&I revenues are recognized net of estimated chargebacks and other costs associated with originating contracts (as a result, F&I revenues and F&I gross profit are the same amount). F&I revenues are affected by the level of new and used vehicle unit sales, the age and average selling price of vehicles sold, the level of manufacturer financing specials or leasing incentives, and our F&I penetration rate. The F&I penetration rate represents the number of finance contracts, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products or insurance contracts that we are able to originate per vehicle sold, expressed as a percentage.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides a reconciliation

Segment\nNew vehicle revenues include the sale of new vehicles to retail customers, as well as the sale of fleet vehicles. New vehicle revenues and gross profit can be influenced by vehicle manufacturer incentives to consumers (which vary from cash-back incentives to low interest rate financing, among other things), the availability of consumer credit and the level and type of manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, as well as manufacturers providing adequate inventory allocations to our dealerships to meet customer demands. The automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand, both within specific brands and in the industry as a whole. As an automotive retailer, we seek to mitigate the effects of this sales cycle by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships.

increased 0.6%, driven primarily by increases in new vehicle unit sales volume at our BMW, Mercedes and Lexus dealerships, offset partially by decreases in new vehicle unit sales volume at our Ford, GM and Honda dealerships. New vehicle gross profit increased approximately $2.2 million, or 1.0%, primarily driven by increases in new vehicle gross profit at our Mercedes, BMW and Honda dealerships, offset partially by decreases in new vehicle gross profit at our Land Rover, Ford and Porsche dealerships. New vehicle gross profit per unit increased $8 per unit, or 0.4%, to $2,083 per unit, primarily driven by increases in new vehicle gross profit per unit at our Mercedes, BMW and Honda dealerships, offset partially by decreases in new vehicle gross profit per unit at our Land Rover, Ford and Porsche dealerships.\nOur reported franchised dealerships new vehicle inventory days' supply was approximately 53 and 59 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in line with our seasonally-adjusted targets.\nUsed Vehicles - Franchised Dealerships Segment\nUsed vehicle revenues are

policy of wholesaling aged or undesirable units at auction in a more timely manner, thereby reducing the risk of wholesale vehicle gross loss and improving inventory levels and quality. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our reported franchised dealerships used vehicle inventory days' supply was approximately 28 and 30 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations - Franchised Dealerships Segment\nParts, service and collision repair revenues consist of customer pay repairs, warranty repairs, wholesale parts and internal, sublet and other. Parts and service revenue is driven by the mix of warranty repairs versus customer pay repairs, available service capacity, vehicle quality, manufacturer recalls, customer loyalty and prepaid or manufacturer-paid maintenance programs. Internal, sublet and other primarily relates to preparation and reconditioning work performed on vehicles that are later sold to customers. When that work is performed by one of our dealerships, the work is classified as internal. In the event the work is performed by a third party on our behalf, it is classified as sublet.\nWe believe that, over time, vehicle quality will continue to improve, but vehicle complexity and the associated demand for repairs by qualified technicians at franchised dealerships will offset any revenue lost from improvement in vehicle quality. We also believe that, over the long term, we have the ability to continue to add service capacity at our dealerships to further increase revenues. Manufacturers continue to extend new vehicle warranty periods and have also begun to include regular maintenance items in the warranty or complimentary maintenance program coverage. These factors, over the long term, combined with the extended manufacturer warranties on CPO vehicles, should facilitate long-term growth in our parts and service business. Barriers to long-term growth may include reductions in the rate paid by manufacturers to dealers for warranty work performed, as well as the improved quality of vehicles that may affect the level and frequency of future customer pay or warranty-related revenues.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table

million, or 5.0%, and Fixed Operations gross profit increased approximately $36.6 million, or 6.0%, driven primarily by an increase in customer pay gross profit of approximately $22.5 million, or 8.2%, as a result of a strategic emphasis on maximizing growth opportunities in the customer pay business. In addition, warranty gross profit increased approximately $6.3 million, or 4.5%, driven primarily by our Honda, Audi and Mercedes dealerships. Warranty revenue typically represents approximately 20% of our Fixed Operations revenue. As such, significant changes to the level of manufacturer recall and warranty repair activity could create volatility in our Fixed Operations results in future periods.\nF&I - Franchised Dealerships Segment\nFinance, insurance and other, net revenues include commissions for arranging vehicle financing and insurance, sales of third-party extended warranties and service contracts for vehicles, and sales of other aftermarket products. In connection with vehicle financing, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products and insurance contracts, we receive commissions from the providers for originating contracts. F&I revenues are recognized net of estimated chargebacks and other costs associated with originating contracts (as a result, F&I revenues and F&I gross profit are the same amount). F&I revenues are affected by the level of new and used vehicle unit sales, the age and average selling price of vehicles sold, the level of manufacturer financing specials or leasing incentives and our F&I penetration rate. The F&I penetration rate represents the number of finance contracts, extended warranties and service contracts, other aftermarket products or insurance contracts that we are able to originate per vehicle sold, expressed as a percentage.\nYield spread premium is another term for the commission earned by our dealerships for arranging vehicle financing for consumers. The amount of the commission could be zero, a flat fee or an actual spread between the interest rate charged to the consumer and the interest rate provided by the direct financing source (e.g., a commercial bank, credit union or manufacturer captive finance company). We have established caps on the potential yield spread premium our dealerships can earn with all\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nfinance sources. We believe the yield spread premium we earn for arranging vehicle financing represents value to the consumer in numerous ways, including the following:\n\u2022lower cost, below-market financing is often available only from the manufacturers' captives and franchised dealers;\n\u2022generally easy access to multiple high-quality lending sources;\n\u2022lease-financing alternatives are largely available only from manufacturers' captives or other indirect lenders;\n\u2022customers with substandard credit frequently do not have direct access to potential sources of sub-prime financing; and\n\u2022customers with significant negative equity\u201d in their current vehicle (i.e., the customer's current vehicle is worth less than the balance of their vehicle loan or lease obligation) frequently are unable to pay off the loan on their current vehicle and finance the purchase or lease of a replacement new or used vehicle without the assistance of a franchised dealer.\nThe following

10.3%, and F&I gross profit per retail unit increased $96 per unit, or 6.5%, to $1,583 per unit. The growth in F&I revenues and F&I gross profit per retail unit was due to increases in gross profit per contract and higher penetration rates across all F&I products. Finance contract gross profit increased 12.5% primarily due to a 7.0% increase in gross profit per finance contract, as well as a 120-basis point increase in the combined new and used vehicle finance contract penetration rate. Service contract gross profit increased 11.5% due primarily to a 5.2% increase in gross profit per service contract, as well as a 70-basis point increase in the service contract penetration rate. Other aftermarket contract gross profit increased 13.9%, driven primarily by a 6.5% increase in gross profit per other aftermarket contract and a 430-basis point increase in the other aftermarket contract penetration rate.\nResults of Operations - EchoPark Segment\nEchoPark Segment same store results consist of the results of seven EchoPark stores, three in Colorado, three in Texas and one in North Carolina for 2019 compared to 2018. Due to the ongoing expansion of our EchoPark Segment, same store results may vary significantly from reported results due to stores that began operations in the last 13 months.\nUsed Vehicles and F&I - EchoPark Segment\nBased on the way we manage the EchoPark Segment, our operating strategy focuses on maximizing total used-related gross profit (based on a combination of retail used vehicle unit sales volume, front-end retail used vehicle gross profit per unit and F&I gross profit per unit) rather than realizing traditional levels of front-end retail used vehicle gross profit per unit. As such, we believe the best per unit measure of gross profit performance at our EchoPark stores is a combined total gross profit per unit, which includes both front-end retail used vehicle gross profit and F&I gross profit per unit sold.\nSee the discussion in Franchised Dealerships Segment Results of Operations for a discussion of the macro drivers of used vehicle revenues and F&I

Wholesale vehicle gross loss increased as a result of the evolution of our customer trade-in vehicle appraisal strategy, which has enabled us to trade for more customer vehicles. Given EchoPark's retail inventory mix, the majority of vehicles acquired from customers on trade-ins cannot ultimately be sold as retail at our EchoPark stores and are subsequently sold at auction, affecting our wholesale gross profit (loss). However, a successful acquisition of a customer's trade-in vehicle often facilitates a retail used vehicle sale transaction that otherwise may not have occurred, driving higher overall gross profit. Our overall EchoPark inventory acquisition and pricing strategy reduces the risk of aged inventory that must be sold at auction (which would typically have a higher gross loss per unit) and increases the volume of trade-ins that we obtain from customers. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our used vehicle inventory days' supply at our EchoPark stores was approximately 33 and 34 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations - EchoPark Segment\nParts, service and collision repair revenues primarily consist of internal, sublet and other work related to inventory preparation and reconditioning performed on vehicles that are later sold to customers. When that work is performed by one of our stores, the work is classified as internal. In the event the work is performed by a third party on our behalf, it is classified as sublet. Our EchoPark stores do not currently perform warranty or customer pay repairs or maintenance work.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EchoPark Segment reported basis and same store

Compensation expense primarily relates to store personnel who are paid a commission or a salary plus commission and support personnel who are paid a fixed salary. Commissions paid to store personnel typically vary depending on gross profits realized and sales volume objectives. Due to the salary component for certain store and corporate personnel, gross profits and compensation expense do not change in direct proportion to one another. Advertising expense and other expense vary based on the level of actual or anticipated business activity and the number of dealerships in operation. Rent expense typically varies with the number of store locations owned, investments made for facility improvements and interest rates. Other expense includes various fixed and variable expenses, including gain on disposal of franchises, certain customer-related costs such as gasoline and service loaners and insurance, training, legal and IT expenses, which may not change in proportion to gross profit levels.\nThe following table sets forth information related to our consolidated reported SG&A expenses:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Better / (Worse) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation </td> <td>$ </td> <td>733,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>725,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,903) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising </td> <td>60,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent </td> <td>54,611 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>250,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>292,965 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,958 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SG&A expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,099,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,145,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses as a % of gross profit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation </td> <td>48.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rent </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>390 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>bps </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total SG&A expenses as a % of gross profit </td> <td>72.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>79.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>bps </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall SG&A expenses decreased both in dollar amount and as a percentage of gross profit, primarily due to a reduction in other variable expense, fixed compensation expense, rent expense, and other fixed SG&A expense, offset partially by higher variable compensation expense. Compensation costs increased in dollar amount but decreased as a percentage of\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ngross profit primarily due to increases in variable compensation expense related to higher levels of sales activity and related gross profit. Advertising expense decreased both in dollar amount and as a percentage of gross profit due primarily to the disposition of several franchised dealerships and higher levels of gross profit. Rent expense decreased both in dollar amount and as a percentage of gross profit due primarily to the disposition of several franchised dealerships and higher levels of gross profit. Other SG&A expenses decreased both in dollar amount and as a percentage of gross profit, primarily due to a higher net gain on the disposal of franchised dealerships in 2019 and physical damage and legal charges in 2018.\nSG&A expenses for 2019 include approximately $76.0 million of net gain on the disposal of franchised dealerships, offset partially by approximately $6.3 million of executive transition costs. SG&A expenses for 2018 include approximately $32.5 million of long-term compensation-related charges, approximately $4.0 million of storm-related physical damage costs, approximately $1.7 million of legal costs, approximately $1.6 million of executive transition costs and approximately $1.4 million of lease exit charges, offset partially by approximately $38.9 million of net gain on the disposal of franchised dealerships.\nImpairment Charges - Consolidated\nImpairment charges were approximately $20.8 million and $29.5 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Impairment charges for 2019 include approximately $19.7 million related to building and land held for sale at former EchoPark locations and approximately $1.1 million related to software impairment. Impairment charges for 2018 include approximately $27.4 million of property and equipment charges due to the abandonment of certain construction projects and internally developed software applications, as well as our estimate that certain dealerships would not be able to recover recorded balances through operating activities, in addition to approximately $2.1 million of franchise asset impairment charges.\nDepreciation and Amortization - Consolidated\nDepreciation expense decreased approximately $0.5 million, or 0.5%, in 2019 primarily related to lower depreciation expense as a result of the disposition of several franchised dealerships, offset partially by higher depreciation expense related to additional EchoPark locations.\nInterest Expense, Floor Plan - Consolidated\nInterest expense, floor plan for new vehicles decreased approximately $0.8 million, or 1.9%. The average new vehicle floor plan notes payable balance increased approximately $5.6 million, resulting in an increase in new vehicle floor plan interest expense of approximately $0.2 million. The average new vehicle floor plan effective interest rate was 3.03%, down from 3.10% in the prior year, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of approximately $1.0 million.\nInterest expense, floor plan for used vehicles increased approximately $0.9 million, or 16.8%. The average used vehicle floor plan notes payable balance increased approximately $22.3 million, resulting in an increase in used vehicle floor plan interest expense of approximately $0.7 million. The average used vehicle floor plan effective interest rate was 3.10%, up from 2.98% in the prior year, which resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately $0.2 million.\nInterest Expense, Other, Net - Consolidated\nInterest expense, other, net is summarized in the table below:\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Better / (Worse) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stated/coupon interest </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,727 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred loan cost amortization </td> <td>2,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest rate hedge expense (benefit) </td> <td>(2,876) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(462) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>522.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized interest </td> <td>(1,583) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,515) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on finance lease liabilities </td> <td>5,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,097) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other interest </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest expense, other, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, other, net decreased approximately $1.1 million, primarily due to an increase in net interest rate hedge receipts and lower stated/coupon interest related to a decrease in mortgage notes payable balances, offset partially by an\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nincrease in interest expense related to finance leases (known as capital leases prior to the adoption of ASC 842, Leases,\u201d on January 1, 2019).\nProvision for Income Taxes - Consolidated\nThe overall effective tax rate from continuing operations was 27.6% and 30.4% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income tax expense for 2019 includes the effect of a $1.5 million discrete charge for non-deductible executive officer compensation related to executive transition costs, a $0.4 million discrete charge related to tax return to provision adjustments and a state income tax rate reduction, a $0.2 million discrete charge related to changes in uncertain tax positions and a $0.2 million discrete charge related to vested or exercised stock compensation awards, offset partially by a $1.3 million discrete benefit related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Our effective tax rate varies from year to year based on the distribution of taxable income between states in which we operate and other tax adjustments. We expect the effective tax rate in future periods to fall within a range of 26.0% to 29.0% before the impact, if any, of changes in valuation allowances related to deferred income tax assets, non-deductible compensation or unusual discrete tax adjustments.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes is as follows:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(554) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(610) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(735) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease exit accrual adjustments and charges </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(407) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,207) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(554) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,017) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,942) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe do not expect significant activity in discontinued operations in the future due to the change in the definition of a discontinued operation as a result of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-08. The results of operations for those dealership and franchises that were classified as discontinued operations as of March 31, 2014 will continue to be reported within discontinued operations in the future. See the discussion of our adoption of ASU 2014-08 in Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCritical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments. See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nGoodwill and Franchise Assets\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d we test goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of October 1 of each year), or more frequently if indications of impairment exist. The ASC also states that if an entity determines, based on an assessment of certain qualitative factors, that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary.\nFor purposes of goodwill impairment testing, we have two reporting units, which consist of (1) our traditional franchised dealerships and (2) our EchoPark stores (these reporting units also represent our reportable segments). The carrying value of our goodwill totaled approximately $475.8 million at December 31, 2019, $415.8 million of which was related to our franchised dealerships reporting unit and $60.0 million of which was related to our EchoPark reporting unit. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference would represent the amount of the required goodwill impairment. For each reporting unit, we utilized the Discounted Cash Flows ( DCF\u201d) method to estimate its enterprise value as of October 1, 2019. The significant assumptions in our DCF model include projected earnings, a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs) and residual growth rates. To the extent the reporting unit's earnings decline\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nsignificantly or there are changes in one or more of these assumptions that would result in lower valuation results, it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value and thus require us to record goodwill impairment.\nBased on the results of our goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2019, each reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value, and as such, no impairment was required. Our DCF model is dependent on the assumptions used and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions. In order to determine the effects of changes in our assumptions on our DCF model, and, consequently our goodwill valuation, we ran multiple scenarios adjusting our assumed earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT\u201d) growth factors and discount rate assumptions. Although we assumed a 1.0% residual EBIT growth factor in our model, in the event the residual EBIT growth rate decreased by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain the same, the calculated fair value estimate as of October 1, 2019 would change by approximately $260.2 million and $28.4 million for our franchised dealerships and EchoPark reporting units, respectively. In the event the discount rate increased by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain the same, the calculated fair value estimate as of October 1, 2019 would change by approximately $318.9 million and $38.0 million for our franchised dealerships and EchoPark reporting units, respectively. In the event the residual EBIT growth rate decreased by 100 basis points and the discount rate increased by 100 basis points, assuming all other factors remain the same, the calculated fair value estimate as of October 1, 2019 would change by approximately $508.0 million and $61.6 million for our franchised dealerships and EchoPark reporting units, respectively. Based on our DCF model, if any of the realistic scenarios described above were realized, the reporting unit's fair value remains substantially in excess of the carrying value.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d we evaluate franchise assets for impairment annually (as of October 1 of each year) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We estimate the fair value of our franchise assets using a DCF model. The DCF model used contains inherent uncertainties, including significant estimates and assumptions related to projected revenue, projected operating margin, a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs) and residual growth rates. We are subject to financial risk to the extent that our franchise assets become impaired due to deterioration of the underlying businesses. The risk of a franchise asset impairment charge may increase to the extent the underlying businesses' actual earnings or projected earnings experience a significant decline. As a result of our impairment testing as of October 1, 2019, each of our franchise assets' fair values exceeded its carrying value and no franchise asset impairment charges were recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of our franchise assets totaled approximately $64.3 million at December 31, 2019, and is included in other intangible assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFinance, Insurance and Service Contracts\nWe arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the financial institution either in a flat fee amount or in an amount equal to the difference between the interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined interest rates set by the financial institution. We also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non-recourse third-party extended service contracts to customers. Under these contracts, the applicable manufacturer or third-party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract.\nIn the event a customer terminates a financing, insurance or extended service contract prior to the scheduled maturity date, we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded as income by Sonic to the third-party provider (known as a chargeback\u201d). The commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale. Our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates, termination provisions of the applicable contracts and industry data. While chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold, a 100-basis point change in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have changed our estimated reserve for chargebacks at December 31, 2019 by approximately $3.2 million. Our estimate of chargebacks (approximately $32.0 million as of December 31, 2019) is influenced by the number of early contract termination events, such as vehicle repossessions, loan refinancing and early pay-offs. If these events become more or less common, the resulting impact would affect our future estimate for chargebacks and could have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial position and cash flows. Our actual chargeback experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe have various self-insured and high deductible casualty and other insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs. We accrue for insurance reserves throughout the year based on current information available. As of December 31, 2019, we estimated the ultimate liability under these programs to be between $21.8 million and $24.1 million, and had approximately $23.1 million reserved for\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nsuch programs. Changes in significant assumptions used in the development of the ultimate liability for these programs could have a material impact on the level of reserves and our operating results, financial position and cash flows. These significant assumptions could include the volume of claims, medical cost trends, claims handling and reporting patterns, historical claims experience, the effect of related court rulings, current or projected changes in state laws or an assumed discount rate. From a sensitivity analysis perspective, it is difficult to quantify the effect of changes in any of these significant assumptions with the exception of the volume of claims. We believe a 10% change in the volume of claims would have a proportional effect on our reserves. Our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates.\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are involved, and expect to continue to be involved, in various legal and administrative proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including regulatory investigations and private civil actions brought by plaintiffs purporting to represent a potential class or for which a class has been certified. Although we vigorously defend ourselves in all legal and administrative proceedings, the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business, including litigation with customers, employment-related lawsuits, contractual disputes, class actions, purported class actions and actions brought by governmental authorities, cannot be predicted with certainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had accrued approximately $1.5 million in legal reserves. Although we vigorously defend ourselves in all legal proceedings, the outcomes of pending and future proceedings arising out of the conduct of our business cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities and, from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We believe that our tax positions comply, in all material respects, with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Examples of such transactions include business acquisitions and disposals, including consideration paid or received in connection with such transactions. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We adjust our estimates periodically because of ongoing examinations by and settlements with the various taxing authorities, as well as changes in tax laws, regulations and precedent.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were approximately $4.4 million in reserves that we had provided for these matters (including estimates related to possible interest and penalties) with approximately $0.5 million included in other accrued liabilities and approximately $3.9 million recorded in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The effects on our consolidated financial statements of income tax uncertainties are discussed in Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe periodically review all deferred tax asset positions (including state net operating loss carryforwards) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Certain factors considered in evaluating the potential for realization of deferred tax assets include the time remaining until expiration (related to state net operating loss carryforwards) and various sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit related to a deferred tax asset. This evaluation requires management to make certain assumptions about future profitability, the execution of tax strategies that may be available to us and the likelihood that these assumptions or execution of tax strategies would occur. This evaluation is highly judgmental. The results of future operations, regulatory framework of these taxing authorities and other related matters cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, actual realization of these deferred tax assets may be materially different from management's estimate.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had recorded a valuation allowance amount of approximately $7.8 million and $8.1 million, respectively, related to certain state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets as we determined that we\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nwould not be able to generate sufficient state taxable income in the related entities to realize the accumulated net operating loss carryforward balances.\nWe make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions in the calculation of our provision for income taxes, in the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are updated quarterly by our management based on available information and take into consideration estimated income taxes based on prior year income tax returns, changes in income tax law, our income tax strategies and other factors. If our management receives information which causes us to change our estimate of the year-end liability, the amount of expense or expense reduction required to be recorded in any particular quarter could be material to our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) established ASC Topic 842, Leases,\u201d by issuing ASU 2016-02 (and subsequent amendments via ASU 2018-01, ASU 2018-10 and ASU 2018-11) in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing operating lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new lease standard was effective for us on January 1, 2019. Prior to adoption of the new lease standard, only leases classified as capital leases under ASC 840, Leases,\u201d were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Under ASC 842, Leases,\u201d we classify leases as either finance leases (formerly capital leases) or operating leases, and a right-of-use asset and lease liability are required to be recognized in the consolidated balance sheets for both finance and operating leases with a term longer than 12 months. The new lease standard required a modified retrospective transition approach and provides an optional transition method to either (1) record current existing leases as of the effective date; or (2) record leases existing as of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements by recasting comparative period financial statements. We adopted the new lease standard as of January 1, 2019 using the effective date as our date of application. As such, financial statement information and disclosures required under the new lease standard are not provided for dates and periods prior to January 1, 2019. The new lease standard provides for a number of optional practical expedients in transition, which include: (1) not requiring an entity to reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification or initial direct costs; (2) allowing an entity to use a portfolio approach for similar lease assets; (3) allowing an entity to elect an accounting policy to choose not to separate non-lease components of an agreement from lease components (by asset class); (4) allowing the use of hindsight in estimating lease term or assessing impairment of right-of-use assets; and (5) not requiring an entity to reassess prior conclusions about land easements. We elected all of the practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new lease standard. The new lease standard also provides practical expedients for ongoing accounting. We elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for our real estate and equipment leases, which means that for those leases that qualify, we do not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. We have also elected the practical expedient that allows us not to separate non-lease components of an agreement from lease components (for certain asset classes). See Note 16, Lease Accounting,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on leases.\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, which amends the hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\u201d This ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the financial statements. It also includes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of current guidance related to hedge accounting. For public companies, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows the reclassification of stranded tax effects, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017, from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. For public companies, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07 to expand the scope of ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation,\u201d to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from non-employees. For public companies, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.\u201d The amendment in this update replaced the previous incurred loss impairment methodology of recognizing credit losses when a loss is probable, with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nrequires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to assess credit loss estimates. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2020 and the effects of the adoption of this ASU are not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to fund debt service, lease obligations, working capital requirements, facility improvements and other capital improvements, and dividends on our common stock and to finance acquisitions and otherwise invest in our business. We rely on cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit and floor plan borrowing arrangements, real estate mortgage financing, asset sales and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements. We closely monitor our available liquidity and projected future operating results in order to remain in compliance with restrictive covenants under the 2016 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, the indenture governing the 6.125% Notes and other debt obligations and lease arrangements. However, our liquidity could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with the financial covenants in our existing debt or lease arrangements. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on the payment of dividends under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2019, we had at least $259.9 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. Cash flows provided by our dealerships are derived from various sources. The primary sources include individual consumers, automobile manufacturers, automobile manufacturers' captive finance subsidiaries and other financial institutions. Disruptions in these cash flows could have a material adverse impact on our operations and overall liquidity.\nBecause the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries, the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flows and ability to service our obligations depend to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash.\nWe had the following liquidity resources available as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility </td> <td>230,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>223,922 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under the 2019 Mortgage Facility </td> <td>3,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under our used vehicle floor plan facilities </td> <td>17,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total available liquidity resources </td> <td>$ </td> <td>279,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231,755 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-Term Debt and Credit Facilities\n2016 Credit Facilities\nOn November 30, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated syndicated revolving credit facility (the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and amended and restated syndicated new and used vehicle floor plan credit facilities (the 2016 Floor Plan Facilities\u201d and, together with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, the 2016 Credit Facilities\u201d), which are scheduled to mature on November 30, 2021. The amendment and restatement of the 2016 Credit Facilities extended the scheduled maturity date, increased availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility by $25.0 million and increased availability under the 2016 Floor Plan Facilities by $215.0 million, among other things.\nAvailability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is calculated as the lesser of $250.0 million or a borrowing base calculated based on certain eligible assets, less the aggregate face amount of any outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (the 2016 Revolving Borrowing Base\u201d). The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased at our option up to $300.0 million upon satisfaction of certain conditions. Based on balances as of December 31, 2019, the 2016 Revolving Borrowing Base was approximately $245.3 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings and approximately $14.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, resulting in total borrowing availability of approximately $230.7 million under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe 2016 Floor Plan Facilities are comprised of a new vehicle revolving floor plan facility (the 2016 New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility\u201d) and a used vehicle revolving floor plan facility (the 2016 Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility\u201d), subject to a borrowing base, in a combined amount of up to $1.015 billion. We may, under certain conditions, request an increase in the 2016 Floor Plan Facilities to a maximum borrowing limit of up to $1.265 billion, which shall be allocated between the 2016\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNew Vehicle Floor Plan Facility and the 2016 Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility as we request, with no more than 30% of the aggregate commitments allocated to the commitments under the 2016 Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility. Outstanding obligations under the 2016 Floor Plan Facilities are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries and are secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries' assets. The amounts outstanding under the 2016 Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates based on specified percentages above LIBOR.\nWe agreed under the 2016 Credit Facilities not to pledge any assets to any third party (other than those explicitly allowed to be pledged by the amended terms of the 2016 Credit Facilities), including other lenders, subject to certain stated exceptions, including floor plan financing arrangements. In addition, the 2016 Credit Facilities contain certain negative covenants, including covenants which could restrict or prohibit indebtedness, liens, the payment of dividends, capital expenditures and material dispositions and acquisitions of assets, as well as other customary covenants and default provisions. Specifically, the 2016 Credit Facilities permit cash dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock so long as no event of default (as defined in the 2016 Credit Facilities) has occurred and is continuing and provided that we remain in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2016 Credit Facilities.\n5.0% Notes\nOn May 9, 2013, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 5.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due May 15, 2023 (the 5.0% Notes\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased approximately $10.7 million of the 5.0% Notes for approximately $10.6 million in cash, plus accrued and unpaid interest related thereto. On December 30, 2019, we repurchased all of the remaining 5.0% Notes outstanding, totaling approximately $289.3 million aggregate principal amount, using cash on hand, net proceeds from the disposition of several franchised dealerships and proceeds from borrowings under the 2019 Mortgage Facility. We paid approximately $295.9 million in cash, including an early redemption premium of 1.667% and accrued and unpaid interest, to extinguish the 5.0% Notes. In conjunction with the redemption of the 5.0% Notes, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $6.7 million, recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In addition, we recognized approximately $0.5 million of double-carry interest in interest expense, other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the period during which both the 5.0% Notes and the 2019 Mortgage Facility had outstanding balances. On December 30, 2019, after the repurchase of all of the outstanding 5.0% Notes, there were no notes outstanding under the indenture which governed the 5.0% Notes, and the indenture was discharged at that time.\n6.125% Notes\nOn March 10, 2017, we issued $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior subordinated 6.125% Notes which mature on March 15, 2027. The 6.125% Notes were issued at a price of 100.0% of the principal amount thereof. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 6.125% Notes to repurchase all of the outstanding 7.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2022 (the 7.0% Notes\u201d) on March 27, 2017. Remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 6.125% Notes were used for general corporate purposes. Balances outstanding under the 6.125% Notes are guaranteed by all of our domestic operating subsidiaries. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. The parent company has no independent assets or operations. The non-domestic operating subsidiary that is not a guarantor is considered to be minor. Interest on the 6.125% Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. We may redeem the 6.125% Notes, in whole or in part, at any time on or after March 15, 2022 at the following redemption prices, which are expressed as percentages of the principal amount:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Redemption\nPrice\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning on March 15, 2022 </td> <td>103.063 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning on March 15, 2023 </td> <td>102.042 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning on March 15, 2024 </td> <td>101.021 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Beginning on March 15, 2025 and thereafter </td> <td>100.000 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBefore March 15, 2022, we may redeem all or a part of the 6.125% Notes at a redemption price equal to 100.0% of the principal amount of the 6.125% Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium (as defined in the indenture governing the 6.125% Notes) and any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. In addition, on or before March 15, 2020, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.125% of the par value of the 6.125% Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date with proceeds from certain equity offerings. The indenture governing the 6.125% Notes also provides that holders of the 6.125% Notes may require us to repurchase the 6.125% Notes at a purchase price equal to 101.0% of the par value of the 6.125% Notes, plus\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase if we undergo a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture governing the 6.125% Notes).\nThe indenture governing the 6.125% Notes contains certain specified restrictive covenants. We have agreed not to pledge any assets to any third-party lender of senior subordinated debt except under certain limited circumstances. We also have agreed to certain other limitations or prohibitions concerning the incurrence of other indebtedness, guarantees, liens, certain types of investments, certain transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, issuance of preferred stock, cash dividends to stockholders, distributions, redemptions and the sale, assignment, lease, conveyance or disposal of certain assets. Specifically, the indenture governing the 6.125% Notes limits our ability to pay quarterly cash dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock in excess of $0.12 per share. We may only pay quarterly cash dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock if we comply with the terms of the indenture governing the 6.125% Notes. We were in compliance with all restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the 6.125% Notes as of December 31, 2019.\nOur obligations under the 6.125% Notes may be accelerated by the holders of 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the 6.125% Notes then outstanding if certain events of default occur, including: (1) defaults in the payment of principal or interest when due; (2) defaults in the performance, or breach, of our covenants under the 6.125% Notes; and (3) certain defaults under other agreements under which we or our subsidiaries have outstanding indebtedness in excess of $50.0 million. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt\u201d, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 6.125% Notes.\n2019 Mortgage Facility\nOn November 22, 2019, we entered into a delayed draw-term loan credit agreement, which is scheduled to mature on November 22, 2024 (the 2019 Mortgage Facility\u201d).\nUnder the 2019 Mortgage Facility, Sonic has a maximum borrowing limit of $112.2 million, which varies based on the value of the collateral underlying the 2019 Mortgage Facility. The amount available for borrowing under the 2019 Mortgage Facility is subject to compliance with a borrowing base. The borrowing base is calculated based on 75% of the appraisal value of certain eligible real estate designated by Sonic and owned by certain of our subsidiaries. Based on balances as of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $109.1 million of outstanding borrowings, resulting in total remaining borrowing availability of approximately $3.1 million under the 2019 Mortgage Facility.\nAmounts outstanding under the 2019 Mortgage Facility bear interest at (i) a specified rate above LIBOR (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility), ranging from 1.50% to 2.75% per annum according to a performance-based pricing grid determined by the Company's Consolidated Total Lease Adjusted Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility) as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (the Performance Grid\u201d); or (ii) a specified rate above the Base Rate (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility), ranging from 0.50% to 1.75% per annum according to the Performance Grid. Interest on the 2019 Mortgage Facility is paid monthly in arrears calculated using the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility) according to the Performance Grid. Repayment of principal is paid quarterly commencing on March 31, 2020 through September 30, 2024 at a rate of 2.5% of the aggregate initial principal amount. A balloon payment of the remaining balance will be due at the November 22, 2024 maturity date. Prior to the November 22, 2024 maturity date, the Company reserves the right to prepay the principal amount outstanding at any time without premium or penalty provided the prepayment amount exceeds $0.5 million.\nThe 2019 Mortgage Facility contains usual and customary representations and warranties, and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants which could restrict or prohibit indebtedness, liens, payment of dividends and other restricted payments, capital expenditures and material dispositions and acquisitions of assets, as well as other usual and customary covenants and default provisions. Specifically, the 2019 Mortgage Facility permits quarterly cash dividends on our Class A and Class B Common Stock up to $0.10 per share so long as no Event of Default (as defined in the 2019 Mortgage Facility) has occurred and is continuing and provided that we remain in compliance with all financial covenants under the 2019 Mortgage Facility.\nMortgage Notes to Finance Companies\nAs of December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate of other mortgage notes, excluding the 2019 Mortgage Facility, was 4.36% and the total outstanding mortgage principal balance of these notes was approximately $355.9 million. These mortgage notes require monthly payments of principal and interest through their respective maturities, are secured by the underlying properties and contain certain cross-default provisions. Maturity dates for these mortgage notes range between 2020 and 2033.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Leases\nThe majority of our dealership properties are subject to long-term operating lease arrangements. These facility lease arrangements normally have 10- to 20-year initial terms with one or more five- to 10-year renewal options and do not contain provisions for contingent rent related to the dealership's operations. Many of the leases are subject to the provisions of a guaranty and subordination agreement that contains financial and affirmative covenants. Certain of these facility leases have payments that vary based on interest rates. See the table under the heading Future Liquidity Outlook\u201d below for our future minimum lease payment obligations, net of sublease proceeds. In 2019, the majority of these operating leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 842.\nFloor Plan Facilities\nWe finance our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan facilities with manufacturer captive finance companies and a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial banks. These floor plan facilities are due on demand and bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR or prime. The weighted average interest rate for our new and used floor plan facilities was 3.04% and 3.09% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. We receive floor plan assistance from certain manufacturers. Floor plan assistance received is capitalized in inventory and charged against cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold. We received approximately $41.1 million and $41.7 million in manufacturer assistance in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and recognized in cost of sales approximately $41.5 million and $42.2 million in manufacturer assistance in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles.\nCovenants and Default Provisions\nNon-compliance with covenants, including a failure to make any payment when due, under the 2016 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility, our floor plan agreements with various manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and other lending institutions (the Silo Floor Plan Facilities\u201d), operating lease agreements, mortgage notes to finance companies and the 6.125% Notes (collectively, our Significant Debt Agreements\u201d) could result in a default and an acceleration of our repayment obligation under the 2016 Credit Facilities. A default under the 2016 Credit Facilities or the 2019 Mortgage Facility would constitute a default under the Silo Floor Plan Facilities and could entitle these lenders to accelerate our repayment obligations under one or more of the floor plan facilities. Certain defaults under the 2016 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility and one or more of the Silo Floor Plan Facilities or certain other debt obligations would not result in a default under the 6.125% Notes unless our repayment obligations under the 2016 Credit Facilities, the 2019 Mortgage Facility and/or one or more of the Silo Floor Plan Facilities or such other debt obligations were accelerated. An acceleration of our repayment obligation under any of the Significant Debt Agreements could result in an acceleration of our repayment obligations under our other Significant Debt Agreements. The failure to repay principal amounts of the Significant Debt Agreements when due would create cross-default situations related to other indebtedness. The 2016 Credit Facilities and the 2019 Mortgage Facility include the following financial covenants:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Covenant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Minimum\nConsolidated\nLiquidity\nRatio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum\nConsolidated\nFixed Charge\nCoverage\nRatio\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Maximum\nConsolidated\nTotal Lease\nAdjusted Leverage\nRatio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Required ratio </td> <td>1.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.75 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 actual </td> <td>1.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, many of our facility leases are governed by a guarantee agreement between the landlord and us that contains financial and operating covenants. The financial covenants under the guarantee agreement are identical to those under the 2016 Credit Facilities and the 2019 Mortgage Facility with the exception of one additional financial covenant related to the ratio of EBTDAR to rent (as defined in the guarantee agreement) with a required ratio of no less than 1.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2019, the ratio was 5.57 to 1.00.\nWe were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants in all of our floor plan, long-term debt facilities and lease agreements as of December 31, 2019. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on the payment of dividends and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2019, we had at least $259.9 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the 2016 Credit Facilities.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nDuring 2019, we did not acquire any businesses. We disposed of one luxury franchised dealership and nine mid-line import franchised dealerships in 2019, which generated net cash from dispositions of approximately $250.7 million. See Note 2, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nUnder the 2016 Credit Facilities, we are restricted from making dealership acquisitions in any fiscal year if the aggregate cost of all such acquisitions occurring in any fiscal year is above specific amounts without the written consent of the Required Lenders (as defined in the 2016 Credit Facilities).\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures include the purchase of land and buildings, construction of new franchised dealerships, EchoPark stores and collision repair centers, building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our franchised dealerships and EchoPark stores. We selectively construct or improve new franchised dealership facilities to maintain compliance with manufacturers' image requirements. We typically finance these projects through cash flows from operations, new mortgages or our credit facilities.\nCapital expenditures for 2019 were approximately $125.6 million, including approximately $89.3 million related to our Franchised Dealerships Segment and approximately $36.3 million related to our EchoPark Segment, all of which was funded through cash flows from operations. Of this amount, approximately $79.5 million was related to facility construction projects, approximately $27.1 million was related to real estate acquisitions and approximately $19.0 million was for other fixed assets utilized in our dealership operations. As of December 31, 2019, commitments for facility construction projects totaled approximately $18.0 million. We expect investments related to capital expenditures to be partly dependent upon the availability of mortgage financing to fund significant capital projects.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOur Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock. Historically, we have used our share repurchase authorization to offset dilution caused by the exercise of stock options or the vesting of equity compensation awards and to maintain our desired capital structure. During 2019, we repurchased approximately 0.2 million shares of our Class A Common Stock for approximately $2.4 million in open-market transactions at prevailing market prices and in connection with tax withholdings on the vesting of equity compensation awards. As of December 31, 2019, our total remaining repurchase authorization was approximately $81.2 million. Under the 2016 Credit Facilities, share repurchases are permitted to the extent that no event of default exists and we do not exceed the restrictions set forth in our debt agreements. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on share repurchases and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2019, we had at least $259.9 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions.\nOur share repurchase activity is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors and management, taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, covenant compliance, current economic environment and other factors considered relevant. These factors are considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as our Board of Directors and management determine our share repurchase policy in the future.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors approved four quarterly cash dividends on all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock totaling $0.40 per share during 2019. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on all outstanding shares of Class A and Class B Common Stock of $0.10 per share for stockholders of record on March 13, 2020 to be paid on April 15, 2020. Under the 2016 Credit Facilities, dividends are permitted to the extent that no event of default exists and we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained therein. The indenture governing the 6.125% Notes also contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. After giving effect to the applicable restrictions on share repurchases and certain other transactions under our debt agreements, as of December 31, 2019, we had at least $259.9 million of net income and retained earnings free of such restrictions. The payment of any future dividend is subject to the business judgment of our Board of Directors, taking into consideration our historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, capital requirements, covenant compliance, share repurchases, current economic environment and other factors considered relevant. These factors are considered each quarter and will be scrutinized as our Board of Directors determines our future dividend policy. There is no guarantee that additional dividends will be declared and paid at any time in the future. See Note 6, Long-Term Debt,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash Flows\nCash Flows from Operating Activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $170.9 million, $143.7 million and $162.9 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The provision of cash by operations for 2019 consisted primarily of net income (less non-cash items), an increase in notes payable - floor plan - trade and a decrease in receivables, offset partially by an increase in inventories. The provision of cash by operations for 2018 consisted primarily of net income (less non-cash items), an increase in notes payable - floor plan - trade and a decrease in receivables, offset partially by an increase in inventories. The provision of cash by operations for 2017 consisted primarily of net income (less non-cash items) and a decrease in inventories, offset partially by an increase in receivables and a decrease in notes payable - floor plan - trade.\nWe arrange our inventory floor plan financing through both manufacturer captive finance companies and a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial banks. Our floor plan financed with manufacturer captives is recorded as trade floor plan liabilities (with the resulting change being reflected as operating cash flows). Our dealerships that obtain floor plan financing from a syndicate of manufacturer-affiliated finance companies and commercial banks record their obligation as non-trade floor plan liabilities (with the resulting change being reflected as financing cash flows).\nDue to the presentation differences for changes in trade floor plan financing and non-trade floor plan financing in the consolidated statements of cash flows, decisions made by us to move dealership floor plan financing arrangements from one finance source to another may cause significant variations in operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity, working capital or cash flows.\nNet cash used in combined trade and non-trade floor plan financing was approximately $5.1 million and $12.6 million for 2019 and 2017, respectively. Net cash provided by combined trade and non-trade floor plan financing was approximately $20.7 million for 2018. Accordingly, if all changes in floor plan notes payable were classified as an operating activity, the result would have been net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $136.2 million, $147.5 million and $196.6 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities - Net cash provided by investing activities during 2019 was approximately $136.8 million. Net cash used in investing activities during 2018 and 2017 was approximately $15.3 million and $272.1 million, respectively. The provision of cash during 2019 was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of 10 franchised dealerships and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, offset partially by purchases of land, property and equipment. The use of cash during 2018 was comprised primarily of purchases of land, property and equipment, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of seven franchised dealerships. The use of cash during 2017 was comprised primarily of purchases of land, property and equipment and the acquisition of one pre-owned vehicle store, offset partially by proceeds from the sale of three franchised dealerships.\nThe significant components of capital expenditures relate primarily to dealership renovations, the purchase of certain existing dealership facilities which had previously been financed under long-term operating leases, and the purchase and development of new real estate parcels for the relocation of existing dealerships and the construction of EchoPark stores. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we generated net proceeds from mortgage financing in the amount of approximately $109.1 million, $21.1 million and $52.5 million, respectively, to purchase certain existing dealership facilities and to fund certain capital expenditures.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities - Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $284.4 million and $128.8 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $112.5 million for 2017. For 2019, cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of the extinguishment of the 5.0% Notes, scheduled principal payments and repayments of long-term debt and net repayments on notes payable - floor plan - non-trade, offset partially by proceeds from mortgage notes and the 2019 Mortgage Facility. For 2018, cash used in financing activities was comprised primarily of net repayments on revolving credit facilities, scheduled principal payments and repayments of long-term debt and repurchases of treasury stock, offset partially by proceeds from mortgage notes. For 2017, cash provided by financing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the issuance of the 6.125% Notes, net borrowings on notes payable - floor plan - non-trade and proceeds from mortgage notes, offset partially by the extinguishment of the 7.0% Notes, repurchases of treasury stock and scheduled principal payments and repayments of long-term debt.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations - The accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows include both continuing and discontinued operations. Net cash flows from operating activities associated with discontinued operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were not material to total cash flows.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOne factor that management uses to measure cash flow generation or use is Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for each of our reportable segments.

only of principal obligations.\n(2) Floor plan facility balances are correlated with the amount of vehicle inventory and are generally due at the time that a vehicle is sold. Estimated interest payments were calculated using the December 31, 2019 floor plan facility balance, the weighted average interest rate for the three months ended December 31, 2019 of 2.69% and the assumption that floor plan\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nbalances at December 31, 2019 would be relieved within 60 days in connection with the sale of the associated vehicle inventory.\n(3) Estimated interest payments include receipts related to interest rate caps.\n(4) Other purchase obligations include contracts for real estate purchases, office supplies, utilities, acquisition-related obligations and various other items or other services.\n(5) Amount represents recorded liability, including interest and penalties, related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions\u201d in the ASC. See Note 1, Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d and Note 7, Income Taxes,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe our best sources of liquidity for operations and debt service remain cash flows generated from operations combined with the availability of borrowings under our floor plan facilities (or any replacements thereof), the 2016 Credit Facilities (or any replacements thereof), the 2019 Mortgage Facility, real estate mortgage financing, selected dealership and other asset sales and our ability to raise funds in the capital markets through offerings of debt or equity securities. Because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our dealership subsidiaries, the majority of our cash flows from operations are generated by these subsidiaries. As a result, our cash flows and ability to service our obligations depend to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash.\nSeasonality\nOur operations are subject to seasonal variations. The first quarter normally contributes less operating profit than the second and third quarters, while the fourth quarter normally contributes the highest operating profit of any quarter. Weather conditions, the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality and may adversely affect vehicle demand and, consequently, our profitability. Comparatively, parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees and Indemnification Obligations\nIn connection with the operation and disposition of our dealerships, we have entered into various guarantees and indemnification obligations. When we sell dealerships, we attempt to assign any related lease to the buyer of the dealership to eliminate any future liability. However, if we are unable to assign the related leases to the buyer, we will attempt to sublease the leased properties to the buyer at a rate equal to the terms of the original leases. In the event we are unable to sublease the properties to the buyer with terms at least equal to our leases, we may be required to record lease exit accruals. As of December 31, 2019, our future gross minimum lease payments related to properties subleased to buyers of sold dealerships totaled approximately $38.5 million. Future sublease payments expected to be received related to these lease payments were approximately $37.4 million at December 31, 2019.\nIn accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our dealerships, we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising subsequent to the date of sale, including environmental exposure and exposure resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreement. While our exposure with respect to environmental remediation and repairs is difficult to quantify, our maximum exposure associated with these general indemnifications was approximately $46.5 million at December 31, 2019. These indemnifications expire within a period of one to two years following the date of sale. The estimated fair value of these indemnifications was not material and the amount recorded for this contingency was not significant at December 31, 2019.\nWe also guarantee the floor plan commitments of our 50%-owned joint venture, the amount of which was approximately $4.3 million at December 31, 2019. We expect the aggregate amount of the obligations we guarantee to fluctuate based on dealership disposition activity. Although we seek to mitigate our exposure in connection with these matters, these guarantees and indemnification obligations, including environmental exposures and the financial performance of lease assignees and sublessees, cannot be predicted with certainty. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. See Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these guarantees and indemnification obligations.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.", "summary": "Based on the report provided, the following is a summarized overview:\n\nSonic Automotive, Inc. operates as one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. The company's operations include the Franchised Dealerships Segment and the EchoPark Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment operates 99 new vehicle franchises in 12 states, providing sales of new and used vehicles, parts, service, collision repair, and finance and insurance services. The EchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and provides F&I product sales.\n\nIn 2019, overall performance in terms of new vehicle revenues, used vehicle revenues, and Fixed Operations revenues showed positive growth. The company experienced a slight decrease in total new vehicle unit sales compared to the previous year. However, there were increases in retail used vehicle unit sales volume, Fixed Operations revenue, and F&I revenue. The company's operational goal focuses on growing retail new vehicle sales, and it expects to open three additional EchoPark stores by the end of 2020.\n\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry's total new vehicle unit sales volume was approximately 17.0 million vehicles in 2019, with an industry expectation for 2020's new vehicle SAAR ranging from 16.0 million to 17.0 million vehicles.\n\nThe company reported declines in same store and total new vehicle gross profit, while retail used vehicle gross profit increased. Fixed Operations gross margin increased, driven primarily by higher levels of customer pay revenue and an increase in customer pay gross margin. The company also experienced changes in its inventory and wholesaling strategy in the EchoPark Segment. Net used vehicle inventory days' supply at EchoPark stores was around 33-34 days as of December 31, 2019.\n\nOverall, Sonic Automotive, Inc. continues to pursue opportunities for growth and aims to optimize its operations to improve financial performance.", "item_7_tables": "Table 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

During 2019, we opened one new EchoPark store, which is included in reported amounts for 2019, but is excluded from same store reporting for all periods. During 2018, we opened one new manufacturer-awarded open point franchised dealership, which is included in reported amounts for 2019 and 2018, but is excluded from same store reporting for all periods. In addition, during 2018, we opened three new EchoPark stores, which are included in reported amounts for all periods and two of which are included in same store reporting for 2019 compared to 2018.\nWe disposed of one luxury franchised dealership and nine mid-line import franchised dealerships in 2019, and had no franchises held for sale as of December 31, 2019. We disposed of two luxury franchised dealerships and five mid-line import franchised dealerships, terminated one luxury franchised dealership and closed three EchoPark stores and one previously acquired pre-owned vehicle store in 2018. The results of operations of these disposed dealership franchises and closed stores are included in reported amounts below and in continuing operations on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Dispositions that occurred subsequent to March 31, 2014 have not been reclassified to discontinued operations since they did not meet the criteria for reclassification under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, Business Acquisitions and Dispositions,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for tabular disclosure of the effects of disposed dealership franchises that remain in continuing operations.\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States (as measured by total revenue). As a result of the way we manage our business, we had two reportable segments as of December 31, 2019: (1) the Franchised Dealerships Segment and (2) the EchoPark Segment. For management and operational reporting purposes, we group certain businesses together that share management and inventory (principally used vehicles) into stores.\u201d As of December 31, 2019, we operated 86 stores in the Franchised Dealerships Segment and nine stores in the EchoPark Segment. The Franchised Dealerships Segment consists of 99 new vehicle franchises (representing 21 different brands of cars and light trucks) and 15 collision repair centers in 12 states.\nThe Franchised Dealerships Segment provides comprehensive services, including (1) sales of both new and used cars and light trucks; (2) sales of replacement parts and performance of vehicle maintenance, manufacturer warranty repairs, and paint and collision repair services (collectively, Fixed Operations\u201d); and (3) arrangement of extended warranties, service contracts, financing, insurance and other aftermarket products (collectively, finance and insurance\u201d or F&I\u201d) for our customers. The EchoPark Segment sells used cars and light trucks and arranges F&I product sales for our customers in pre-owned vehicle specialty retail locations. Our EchoPark business operates independently from our franchised dealerships business. Sales operations in our first EchoPark market in Denver, Colorado began in the fourth quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2019, we had three EchoPark stores in operation in Colorado, four in Texas, one in North Carolina and one in California. By the end of 2020, we expect to open three additional EchoPark stores. We believe that the continued expansion of our EchoPark business will provide long-term benefits to the Company, our stockholders and our guests.\nExecutive Summary\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry's total new vehicle unit sales volume was approximately 17.0 million vehicles and 17.2 million vehicles in 2019 and 2018, respectively, according to the Power Information Network ( PIN\u201d) from J.D. Power.\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor 2020, analysts' industry expectation for the new vehicle seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales ( SAAR\u201d) range from 16.0 million to 17.0 million vehicles, a decrease of 4.8% or flat, respectively, compared to the industry volume level in 2019. We estimate the 2020 new vehicle SAAR will be between 16.5 million and 17.0 million vehicles. Changes in consumer confidence, replacement demand as a result of natural disasters, availability of consumer financing, manufacturer inventory production levels or incentive levels from automotive manufacturers could cause actual the 2020 new vehicle SAAR to vary from expectations. Many factors, including brand and geographic concentrations as well as the industry sales mix between retail and fleet new vehicle unit sales volume, have caused our past results to differ from the industry's overall trend. Our current operational goal focuses on growing our retail new vehicle sales, as opposed to fleet new vehicle sales, and, as a result, we believe it is appropriate to compare our retail new vehicle unit sales volume to the retail new vehicle SAAR (which excludes fleet new vehicle sales). According to PIN from J.D. Power, industry retail new vehicle unit sales volume decreased 3.6%, to 13.5 million vehicles, in 2019, from 14.0 million vehicles in 2018.\nOn September 16, 2019, the United Auto Workers union began a strike at General Motors' manufacturing facilities. The strike ended on October 25, 2019 and had minimal impact on our operations. The strike did not limit the rate of new vehicle sales and Fixed Operations revenues at our General Motors franchises. As of December 31, 2019, we operated nine General Motors franchises.\nAs a result of the disposition, termination or closure of several franchised dealership stores since December 31, 2018, the change in consolidated reported amounts from period to period may not be indicative of the future operational or financial performance of our current group of operating stores. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of increases or decreases are for 2019 compared to 2018. The following discussion of new vehicles, used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, parts, service and collision repair, and finance, insurance and other, net is on a same store basis, except where otherwise noted. All currently operating stores (both our franchised dealerships and EchoPark stores) are included within the same store group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of the store's opening or acquisition.\nFranchised Dealerships Segment\nNew vehicle revenue increased 4.2% in 2019, due to higher average selling prices and a 0.6% increase in new vehicle unit sales volume. New vehicle gross profit increased 1.0% in 2019 due to the 0.6% increase in new vehicle unit sales volume and an increase in new vehicle gross profit per unit, which increased $8 per unit, or 0.4%, to $2,083 per unit. While the availability of vehicle pricing information to consumers, increased competition for sales between similar branded dealerships and higher overall inventory levels have resulted in downward pressure on new vehicle pricing, we believe that new vehicle gross profit per unit has stabilized.\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 8.8% in 2019, driven by a 7.7% increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Retail used vehicle gross profit increased 5.8% in 2019, despite a decrease in retail used vehicle gross profit per unit of $23 per unit, or 1.8%, to $1,272 per unit. Our wholesale vehicle gross loss decreased approximately $6.8 million, or 66.0%, during 2019, primarily driven by reaffirming our policy of wholesaling aged or undesirable units at auction in a timelier manner, thereby reducing the risk of wholesale vehicle gross loss and improving inventory levels and quality. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our reported franchised dealerships used vehicle inventory days' supply was approximately 28 and 30 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations revenue increased 5.0% and Fixed Operations gross profit increased 6.0%. Fixed Operations gross margin increased 50 basis points, to 48.9%, in 2019, driven primarily by higher levels of customer pay revenue and an increase in customer pay gross margin.\nF&I revenue increased 10.3% in 2019, driven by an increase in F&I gross profit per retail unit. F&I gross profit per retail unit increased $96 per unit, or 6.5%, to $1,583 per unit, in 2019. We believe that our proprietary software applications, playbook processes and customer-centric selling approach enable us to optimize F&I gross profit and penetration rates (the number of F&I products sold per vehicle) across our F&I product lines. We believe that we will continue to increase revenue in this area as we refine our processes, train our associates and continue to sell a high volume of retail new and used vehicles at our stores.\nEchoPark Segment\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 43.0% and F&I revenue increased 61.9% in 2019, driven primarily by a 45.7% increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume in 2019. Combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit increased\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n$279 per unit, or 14.6%, to $2,187 per unit in 2019. The growth in combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit was primarily due to increased F&I product penetration rates.\nWholesale vehicle gross loss increased approximately $0.8 million, or 156.8%, in 2019, primarily due to a shift in our strategy around wholesaling vehicles that we obtain via trade-in from customers. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our used vehicle inventory days' supply at our EchoPark stores was approximately 33 and 34 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations revenue increased approximately $8.4 million, or 58.2%, in 2019, primarily due to higher vehicle unit sales volume (and resulting inventory reconditioning requirements). Fixed Operations gross profit decreased approximately $2.6 million, or 141.6%, in 2019, due to a shift in inventory strategy during the second quarter of 2018 resulting in less internal reconditioning work per vehicle and the decision to no longer provide customer pay parts and service work at our EchoPark stores.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income:\n\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nNew Vehicles - Consolidated\nNew vehicle revenues include the sale of new vehicles to retail customers, as well as the sale of fleet vehicles. New vehicle revenues and gross profit can be influenced by vehicle manufacturer incentives to consumers (which vary from cash-back incentives to low interest rate financing, among other things), the availability of consumer credit and the level and type of manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, as well as manufacturers providing adequate inventory allocations to our dealerships to meet customer demands. The automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand, both within specific brands and in the industry as a whole. As an automotive retailer, we seek to mitigate the effects of this sales cycle by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships. Our brand\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ndiversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower-priced/economy vehicles to luxury vehicles.\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry's new vehicle unit sales volume below reflects all brands marketed or sold in the United States. This industry sales volume includes brands we do not sell and markets in which we do not operate, therefore our new vehicle unit sales volume may not trend directly in line with the industry unit sales volume. We believe that the retail new vehicle SAAR is a more meaningful metric for comparing our new vehicle unit sales volume to the industry due to our minimal fleet vehicle business.\n\n(1) Source: PIN from J.D.

Our current operational goal focuses on growing our retail new vehicle sales, as opposed to fleet new vehicle sales, and, as a result, we believe it is appropriate to compare our retail new vehicle unit sales volume to the retail new vehicle SAAR (which excludes fleet new vehicle sales). According to PIN from J.D. Power, industry retail new vehicle unit sales volume decreased 3.6%, to 13.5 million vehicles, in 2019, from 14.0 million vehicles in 2018.\nOn September 16, 2019, the United Auto Workers union began a strike at General Motors' manufacturing facilities. The strike ended on October 25, 2019 and had minimal impact on our operations. The strike did not limit the rate of new vehicle sales and Fixed Operations revenues at our General Motors franchises. As of December 31, 2019, we operated nine General Motors franchises.\nAs a result of the disposition, termination or closure of several franchised dealership stores since December 31, 2018, the change in consolidated reported amounts from period to period may not be indicative of the future operational or financial performance of our current group of operating stores. Unless otherwise noted, all discussion of increases or decreases are for 2019 compared to 2018. The following discussion of new vehicles, used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, parts, service and collision repair, and finance, insurance and other, net is on a same store basis, except where otherwise noted. All currently operating stores (both our franchised dealerships and EchoPark stores) are included within the same store group as of the first full month following the first anniversary of the store's opening or acquisition.\nFranchised Dealerships Segment\nNew vehicle revenue increased 4.2% in 2019, due to higher average selling prices and a 0.6% increase in new vehicle unit sales volume. New vehicle gross profit increased 1.0% in 2019 due to the 0.6% increase in new vehicle unit sales volume and an increase in new vehicle gross profit per unit, which increased $8 per unit, or 0.4%, to $2,083 per unit. While the availability of vehicle pricing information to consumers, increased competition for sales between similar branded dealerships and higher overall inventory levels have resulted in downward pressure on new vehicle pricing, we believe that new vehicle gross profit per unit has stabilized.\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 8.8% in 2019, driven by a 7.7% increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume. Retail used vehicle gross profit increased 5.8% in 2019, despite a decrease in retail used vehicle gross profit per unit of $23 per unit, or 1.8%, to $1,272 per unit. Our wholesale vehicle gross loss decreased approximately $6.8 million, or 66.0%, during 2019, primarily driven by reaffirming our policy of wholesaling aged or undesirable units at auction in a timelier manner, thereby reducing the risk of wholesale vehicle gross loss and improving inventory levels and quality. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our reported franchised dealerships used vehicle inventory days' supply was approximately 28 and 30 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations revenue increased 5.0% and Fixed Operations gross profit increased 6.0%. Fixed Operations gross margin increased 50 basis points, to 48.9%, in 2019, driven primarily by higher levels of customer pay revenue and an increase in customer pay gross margin.\nF&I revenue increased 10.3% in 2019, driven by an increase in F&I gross profit per retail unit. F&I gross profit per retail unit increased $96 per unit, or 6.5%, to $1,583 per unit, in 2019. We believe that our proprietary software applications, playbook processes and customer-centric selling approach enable us to optimize F&I gross profit and penetration rates (the number of F&I products sold per vehicle) across our F&I product lines. We believe that we will continue to increase revenue in this area as we refine our processes, train our associates and continue to sell a high volume of retail new and used vehicles at our stores.\nEchoPark Segment\nRetail used vehicle revenue increased 43.0% and F&I revenue increased 61.9% in 2019, driven primarily by a 45.7% increase in retail used vehicle unit sales volume in 2019. Combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit increased\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n$279 per unit, or 14.6%, to $2,187 per unit in 2019. The growth in combined retail used vehicle and F&I gross profit per unit was primarily due to increased F&I product penetration rates.\nWholesale vehicle gross loss increased approximately $0.8 million, or 156.8%, in 2019, primarily due to a shift in our strategy around wholesaling vehicles that we obtain via trade-in from customers. We generally focus on maintaining used vehicle inventory days' supply in the 30- to 35-day range, which may fluctuate seasonally, in order to limit our exposure to market pricing volatility. Our used vehicle inventory days' supply at our EchoPark stores was approximately 33 and 34 days as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nFixed Operations revenue increased approximately $8.4 million, or 58.2%, in 2019, primarily due to higher vehicle unit sales volume (and resulting inventory reconditioning requirements). Fixed Operations gross profit decreased approximately $2.6 million, or 141.6%, in 2019, due to a shift in inventory strategy during the second quarter of 2018 resulting in less internal reconditioning work per vehicle and the decision to no longer provide customer pay parts and service work at our EchoPark stores.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New vehicles </td> <td>46.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>53.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicles </td> <td>33.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale vehicles </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parts, service and collision repair </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance, insurance and other, net </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>10.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, floor plan </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, other, net </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income) expense, net </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes for continuing operations - (benefit) expense </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations - Consolidated\nNew Vehicles - Consolidated\nNew vehicle revenues include the sale of new vehicles to retail customers, as well as the sale of fleet vehicles. New vehicle revenues and gross profit can be influenced by vehicle manufacturer incentives to consumers (which vary from cash-back incentives to low interest rate financing, among other things), the availability of consumer credit and the level and type of manufacturer-to-dealer incentives, as well as manufacturers providing adequate inventory allocations to our dealerships to meet customer demands. The automobile manufacturing industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns characterized by oversupply and weak demand, both within specific brands and in the industry as a whole. As an automotive retailer, we seek to mitigate the effects of this sales cycle by maintaining a diverse brand mix of dealerships. Our brand\nSONIC AUTOMOTIVE, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\ndiversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower-priced/economy vehicles to luxury vehicles.\nThe U.S. retail automotive industry's new vehicle unit sales volume below reflects all brands marketed or sold in the United States. This industry sales volume includes brands we do not sell and markets in which we do not operate, therefore our new vehicle unit sales volume may not trend directly in line with the industry unit sales volume. We believe that the retail new vehicle SAAR is a more meaningful metric for comparing our new vehicle unit sales volume to the industry due to our minimal fleet vehicle business.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions of vehicles) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. industry volume - Retail (1) </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. industry volume - Fleet </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. industry volume - Total (1) </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Source: PIN from J.D.
