Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nToday, most of our revenue comes from the sale of wearable devices, including both trackers and smartwatches. Our products are available in 87 countries worldwide through a variety of channels, including 39,000 retail stores, retailer websites, Fitbit.com and through Fitbit Health Solutions.\nIn 2018, we focused on providing more choice and accessibility to consumers in wearables to drive acquisition of users. We introduced Fitbit Versa, our first mass appeal smartwatch in the second quarter, resulting in increased smartwatch revenue over the course of 2018. Smartwatch revenue increased to 44% of revenue in 2018, from 8% in 2017. We also launched Fitbit Charge 3, which innovates on our Charge family of trackers, and which has sold more than 38 million devices. It gives people health and fitness features in a slim, premium tracker design, with smart functionality, and long battery life at an affordable price. The introduction of Fitbit Ace, a tracker designed for kids ages 8 and up and Fitbit family accounts, also expanded our addressable market.\nThe mix shift towards smartwatches favorably impacted the average selling price of our devices, but negatively impact our gross margin. This was partially mitigated by improvement in operating efficiency. Operating efficiencies were driven by four key areas: returns, warranty claims, product quality and customer support costs.\nAcquiring customers through the sale of a device increases the size of our community of users and also increases the potential for future demand for devices and other monetization opportunities, such as software services or coaching revenue. While software revenue was immaterial in 2018, a growing community of active users provides us an opportunity to introduce or further develop software services for the community in the future.\nIn addition, we focused on growing our Fitbit Health Solutions channel, which delivers health and wellness solutions for employers, health plans and health systems. In the fall, we launched Fitbit Care, a connected health platform that combines health coaching and virtual care, wearable devices, and personalized digital interventions to better support patients outside the walls of the clinical environment. While revenue from the Fitbit Health Solutions channel was immaterial in 2018, growth of the channel provides us an opportunity to drive demand for devices and software services.\nThe following are financial highlights for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,511,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,615,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,169,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(185,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(277,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(102,777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended and As Of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Devices sold\n</td> <td>13,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active users\n</td> <td>27,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevices Sold\nDevices sold represents the number of wearable devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings with differing U.S. manufacturer's suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.\nActive Users\nFitbit builds its community of users through device sales and investment in its software to drive engagement. We define an active user as a registered Fitbit user who, within the three months prior to the date of measurement, has (a) an active Fitbit Coach subscription, (b) paired a wearable device or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account, or (c) logged at least 100 steps with a wearable device or a weight measurement using an Aria scale. Active users can be new users who joined the community during the past ninety days, existing users who have remained active and met our definition of an active user, or previously active users who were inactive for 90 days or greater. The active user number excludes users who have downloaded our mobile apps without purchasing any of our wearable devices and users who have downloaded free versions of Fitbit Coach but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nThe active user metric is intended to provide a snapshot of the potential size and growth of our engaged user community. We believe interest in health and fitness ebbs and flows and as such, the active user metric is not designed to be a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period. Accordingly, this metric does not take into account the extent to which inactive users are offset by new active users or how long an individual user remains active.\nThe number of active users is based on activity associated with each Fitbit user account. A user establishes an account with us by registering his or her email with us at Fitbit.com or through our app. As such, the active user metric reflects the number of Fitbit users who meet our definition of an active user during the measurement period; it is not associated with the particular device(s) owned by a user. Accordingly, a user with multiple devices synced to his or her account would only be counted as one active user. As a percentage of the active user metric, users who logged at least 100 steps with a health and fitness tracker or a weight measurement using an Aria scale but had an existing user account in a prior quarter increased from 79% as of December 31, 2017 to 82% percent as of December 31, 2018.\nHowever, it is also possible to have multiple active users associated with a single device at different points in time, such as with users who acquired a refurbished device and with users who acquired a device directly from another user. In such cases, particularly the latter instance, it is also possible that the prior owner and new owner of a single device could each be counted as unique active users during the same measurement period. However, we believe it is appropriate to include both new and prior owners of a particular device in the active user metric because the metric is intended to provide a snapshot of the potential size and growth of our engaged user community during the measurement period. Since both the new and prior owners meet the active user metric, we believe both users would be appropriately included in the active user metric as both users independently have demonstrated a level of engagement with our devices and platform.\nIn addition, the active user metric is not intended to be an indicator of device sales in any period, as device sales are reported as a separate metric. We do not believe that the active user metric has a direct effect on our revenue and operating results since substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from sales of our wearable devices. However, we believe the size of our active user population is a potential indicator of future demand from repeat buyers for our devices and for other future monetization opportunities such as software services or coaching revenue. We aim to increase the active user metric by developing products, services and content that are compelling for new, existing, and prior users.\nActivations - Repeat and Re-Activated Users\nWe define an Activation\u201d as the first instance of a Fitbit device (excluding Aria, Aria 2, Flyer and other accessories) pairing to a user account during the three months prior to the date of measurement. A Repeat User\u201d is defined as a Fitbit user who activated a Fitbit device to his or her account during the measurement period and activated a different Fitbit device to his or her account during a prior period. A Re-Activated User\u201d is defined as Repeat User who has not synced his or her prior device and taken at least 100 steps for 90 days or more prior to the measurement period with such device.\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2018, 35.1% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 56.5% of those Repeat Users. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, 32.6% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 47.1% of those Repeat Users. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 37.6% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 52.0% of those Repeat Users. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 36.9% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 41.3% of those Repeat Users. We calculated the full year Activation metric by summing the Activations from Repeat Users and Re-Activated Users in each of the four quarters in 2018 and 2017. As such, a user who activated more than one Fitbit device to his or her account during the year and had activated a different Fitbit device in a prior year would count as a Repeat User more than once.\nWe believe that the Activations metric is a potential indicator of repeat purchase behavior but not a guarantee of repeat purchase behavior. Actual repeat purchase behavior may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to our ability to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, litigation expense related to matters with Aliphcom, Inc. d/b/a Jawbone, or Jawbone, the impact of our restructuring in 2017, the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, impairment of equity investment, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, change in contingent consideration, interest income (expense), net, and income tax expense (benefit). See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\nFree cash flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchase of property and equipment. See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures- Free cash flow\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nProduct Introductions\nTo date, product introductions have often had a significant, positive impact on our operating results due primarily to increases in revenue associated with sales of the new products in the quarters following their introduction. Furthermore, new product introductions, or NPI, which we define as new products shipped in the past 12 months, could also adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and users. New products may also have higher costs associated with them, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, we have incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and enhance our existing products, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases.\nInternational Expansion\nOur revenue, based on ship-to destinations, from sales outside of the United States represented 42% of our revenue in both 2017 and 2018. We believe our global opportunity is significant, and to address this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts, distribution channels, and infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sales of our products and services in international markets. Moreover, our international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nCategory Adoption, Expansion of our Total Addressable Market, and Market Growth\nAs a pioneer of the wearable device market, we believe we have contributed significantly to the market's growth. However, our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of wearable devices as a means to improve health and fitness and the growth of this market. In addition, our long-term growth depends in part on our ability to expand into adjacent markets in the future.\nCompetition\nThe market for wearable devices is both evolving and competitive. The wearable devices category has a multitude of participants, including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin and Withings, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, and Samsung. For example, Apple sells the Apple Watch, which is a smartwatch with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. Moreover, smartwatches with health and fitness functionalities may displace the market for traditional tracker devices. For example, Apple's recently introduced Apple Watch includes ECG functionality and fall detection capability. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, we have experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For example, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, our fourth quarter represented 38%, 35% and 26% of our annual revenue, respectively. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods.\nInvesting in Growth\nOur business is in a multi-year transition process where we expect to leverage our core assets of brand, community, and data to focus on four key areas: adapting to the changing wearable device market; deepening our reach within healthcare; increasing our agility and optimizing our cost structure; and transforming our business from an episodic driven model centered around device sales to more life time value and recurring revenue. We expect our device mix to continue to shift towards smartwatches in 2019. This will benefit average selling price, but will not offset the decline in our tracker unit growth. We expect the device mix shift to negatively impact gross margins, partially offset by operating efficiencies. For the full year 2019, operating expenses are expected to decline in absolute dollars as compared to the full year 2018. We intend to drive incremental margin on the device side of the business and redeploy capital to grow international sales, Fitbit Health Solutions and recurring revenue opportunities.\nWe also expect to leverage the strength of our partners or acquire where necessary to increase speed to market and our ability to scale the business more effectively. For example, in 2016 we acquired assets from Coin, Pebble and Vector Watch to enhance the features and functionality of our devices, accelerate the expansion of our platform and ecosystem, and grow our capabilities in lower cost regions of the world. In 2018 we acquired Twine Health to further extend our reach into healthcare and to lay the foundation to expand our offerings to health plans, health systems and self-insured employers, including the introduction of Fitbit Care, a connected health platform for health plans and employers, in the third quarter of 2018, while creating opportunities to increase our subscription-based revenue.\nFurthermore, we intend to increase our focus on the health ecosystem, building relationships with employers, wellness providers, and payers. The corporate wellness market for wearable devices market is new and is subject to a variety of challenges, including whether employers, health systems, and payers will continue to invest in such programs, long sales cycles, and substantial upfront sales costs. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived less than 10% of our revenue from our Fitbit Health Solutions offerings. However, we believe that as healthcare costs continue to rise and as the healthcare ecosystem continues to seek ways to manage their costs, this represents an opportunity to grow revenue. In order to grow our Fitbit Health Solutions presence, we intend to enhance our offerings as well as expand our sales team focused on this market.\nProduct Quality\nWe sell complex products and services that could contain design and manufacturing defects in their materials, hardware, and firmware. These defects could include defective materials or components, or bugs,\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the products' intended operations or cause injuries to users or property. Although we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products and services before their release, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. In addition, we utilize products and services provided by third-parties, such as vendors and contract manufacturers, and we rely on their\nrepresentations and do not have full control over their processes. Failure to detect, prevent, or fix defects, or an increase in defects could result in a variety of consequences including a greater number of returns of products than expected from users and retailers, increases in warranty costs, regulatory proceedings, product recalls, and litigation, which could harm our revenue and operating results.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe have three sources of revenue: consumer device revenue, Fitbit Health Solutions revenue, and consumer non-device revenue. The vast majority of our total revenue comes from the sale of wearable devices through the retail, direct, and Fitbit Health Solutions channels. Within the Fitbit Health Solutions channel, revenue is comprised of devices, services, and software with most of it driven by device sales. Consumer non-device revenue represents a small portion of total revenue, primarily from our subscription-based Fitbit Coach services.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our wearable devices, which includes both trackers and accessories and smartwatches sold both directly to consumers as well as through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based Fitbit Coach services and from software services sold through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, hosting costs, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and change in contingent consideration.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses represent a significant component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, POP display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, allocated overhead, information technology, bad debt expense, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists of foreign currency gains and losses, and impairment loss from an equity investment.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.\nOn July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation. This opinion reversed the prior decision of the United States Tax Court. On August 7, 2018, the Court withdrew the opinion issued on July 24, 2018 to allow time for a reconstituted panel of judges to confer. We will continue to monitor the case.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act, was signed into law and includes several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, elimination of certain deductions, and changes to how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as re-assessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018, we finalized all provisional amounts related to the 2017 Tax Act. Finalizing provisional adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of operating results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The decrease was primarily from a 9% reduction in devices sold driven by a decline in the demand for our trackers as the wearable market shifted from trackers to smartwatches. This shift adversely impacted us since trackers represented the majority of our revenue in 2017. Our tracker decline was partially offset by the growth in sales of our smartwatches, primarily from our introduction of Fitbit Versa in 2018, our first mass appeal smartwatch, which has enabled us to participate in the faster growing portion of the wearables device market. As a result, our smartwatch revenue grew by 437%, from 8% of our revenue in 2017 to 44% of our revenue in 2018, and our tracker revenue declined by 44%, from 88% of our revenue in 2017 to 53% of our revenue in 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year. The product mix shift towards higher end smartwatches favorably impacted the ASP of our devices. ASP increased by 4%, from $101 in 2017 to $105 in 2018. During 2018, we benefited from an improved lower rate of product returns and from $12.4 million in revenue from the release of outstanding product return and rebate reserves related to Wynit, as we believe the possibility of future claims associated with these reserves is remote. Revenue from NPI increased by 74%, from $498.3 million, or 31% of revenue, in 2017, to $869.4 million, or 57% of revenue, in 2018. NPI revenue for 2018 was primarily from Fitbit Versa, Fitbit Charge 3 and Fitbit Ace. Revenue from our direct channel, Fitbit.com, decreased by 8% to $154.7 million, or 10% of revenue in 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in our direct channel revenue was primarily due to a decline in discounted sales derived from customer claims. In response to customer complaints about out of warranty devices, we offer certain customers discounts on new products in lieu of providing replacements. These discounts are generally redeemed through our direct channel. The improved quality of our products has resulted in fewer customer complaints and, as a result, the issuance of fewer discount offers, therefore driving a decrease in direct channel revenue. Revenue from accessories declined by 32% and software services increased by 29%, compared to the prior fiscal year.\nRevenue decreased $553.9 million, or 26%, from $2.2 billion for 2016 to $1.6 billion for 2017. Our 2017 results reflect lower demand for our trackers as consumers started migrating towards higher-end smartwatches, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily in the United States. A substantial majority of the decrease was due to a 31% decline in the number of devices sold, from 22.3 million in 2016 to 15.3 million in 2017. The decrease was offset in part by an 8% increase in the average selling price of our devices, from $94 for 2016 to $101 for 2017, due to favorable product mix primarily from our special edition devices. Revenue from NPI decreased by 67%, from $1.5 billion, or 70% of revenue, in 2016, to $498.3 million, or 31% of revenue, in\n2017. NPI revenue for 2017 included Fitbit Ionic, Fitbit Alta HR, Fitbit Aria 2 and Fitbit Flyer. Revenue from our direct channel, Fitbit.com, increased by 11% to $167.9 million, or 10% of revenue, in 2017, compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.\nU.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, decreased $63.5 million, or 7%, from $944.1 million for 2017 to $880.5 million for 2018. International revenue decreased $40.0 million, or 6%, from $671.5 million for 2017 to $631.4 million for 2018, primarily due to decreases of 13% in the EMEA region, and 13% in the Americas excluding the United States region, offset in part by a 27% increase in the APAC region. The decline in EMEA was driven primarily by revenue declines in the United Kingdom region due to an increased competitive environment.\nU.S. revenue, based on ship-to destinations, decreased $595.5 million, or 39%, from $1.5 billion for 2016 to $944.1 million for 2017. International revenue increased $41.6 million, or 7%, from $629.9 million for 2016 to $671.5 million for 2017, due to increases in revenue of 13% in the EMEA region and 6% in the Americas excluding the United States region, partially offset by a decrease in revenue of 12% in the APAC region.\nFor the full year 2019, we expect revenue to increase modestly as compared to the full year 2018.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>908,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>924,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,323,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,214\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(398,959\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>603,579\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>690,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>845,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(87,322\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(154,983\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue decreased $16.2 million, or 2%, from $924.6 million for 2017 to $908.4 million for 2018. The decrease was due to a 9% decline in the number of devices sold during 2018 and lower warranty costs and lower customer support contact rates due to improved quality of our products, offset in part by product mix shift towards higher cost smartwatches, which increased from 8% of revenue for 2017 to 44% of revenue for 2018. Gross margin decreased to 40% for 2018 from 43% for 2017 primarily due to our product mix shift towards higher cost smartwatches which have lower gross margins than our health and fitness trackers, offset in part by lower warranty costs and lower customer support contact rates due to improved quality of our products, and the recognition of revenue due to the release of outstanding product return and rebate reserves related to Wynit described above.\nCost of revenue decreased $399.0 million, or 30%, from $1.3 billion for 2016 to $924.6 million for 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the 31% decline in the number of devices sold during 2017, a decrease in excess manufacturing capacity costs, a decrease in excess and obsolete inventory write-downs for certain legacy products, a decrease in accelerated depreciation of manufacturing and tooling equipment, and lower warranty costs. Gross margin increased to 43% for 2017 from 39% for 2016 primarily due to the significant drop in demand that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2016, causing us to incur significant excess manufacturing capacity costs, excess and obsolete inventory write-downs for certain legacy products, and accelerated depreciation of manufacturing and tooling equipment in 2016, combined with lower warranty costs in 2017. In 2017, we also benefited from an initiative to improve our forecasting accuracy that reduced our exposure to the above described significant costs that we experienced during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe expect our gross margin to decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the continued mix shift towards lower margin smartwatches and the introduction of lower priced devices. We expect these to be partially offset by lower warranty costs and customer contact rates, and improved manufacturing processes.\nResearch and Development\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>343,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>320,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,843\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses decreased $10.8 million, or 3%, from $343.0 million for 2017 to $332.2 million for 2018.

Our effective tax rate was (0.9)% and (42.4)% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense for 2018 was primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in 2017, the mix of income or losses between our foreign jurisdictions, and pretax losses in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit will be recognized.\nIncome tax expense increased $89.1 million, from a benefit of $6.5 million for 2016 to an expense of $82.5 million for 2017. Our effective tax rate was (42.4)% and 6.0% for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in income tax expense for 2017 was primarily due to establishment of a full valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets, partially offset by an anticipated carryback of losses incurred in 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations have been financed primarily through cash flow from operating activities and net proceeds from the sale of our equity securities. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $474.0 million and marketable securities of $249.5 million, approximately 85% of which are held on-shore by a U.S. legal entity.\nOf our total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, $111.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings from foreign operations and current plans do not anticipate that we will require funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations. In the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the United States in the future, we may be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on repatriated funds at that time.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalent, and marketable securities balances, and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our levels of revenue, the timing and extent of spending on research and development efforts and other business initiatives, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our products, acquisitions, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in\nadditional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nCredit Facility\nOn November 21, 2018, we voluntarily terminated our Senior Facility. As of the date of termination, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under the Senior Facility but did have outstanding letters of credit totaling $36.6 million, issued to cover various security deposits on our facility leases. In connection with this termination, all outstanding letters of credit issued under the Senior Facility are being held with SVB on an unsecured basis. We did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Senior Facility. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit of $36.6 million issued to cover various security deposits on our facility leases.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>17,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(392,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>1,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,794\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(234,152\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $113.2 million for 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $122.8 million, which consisted of a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to the receipt of a $72 million income tax refund, and an increase in accounts payables, offset in part by an increase in inventory primarily related to Fitbit Charge 3 and Fitbit Versa, a decrease in accrued liabilities as a result of lower operating activity during the current period, and an increase in accounts receivables. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was also impacted by non-cash adjustments of $176.3 million, primarily resulting from stock-based compensation expense of $97.0 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $56.8 million, provision for inventory obsolescence of $11.8 million, write-off of property and equipment of $7.7 million and impairment loss from an equity investment of $6.0 million, partially offset by a net loss of $(185.8) million. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, calculated as the number of days represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end, decreased from 76 days as of December 31, 2017 to 70 days as of December 31, 2018 due to higher collections during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $64.2 million for 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.1 million, which consisted of a decrease in inventory as a result of lower inventory purchases which decreased accounts payable and decreased accrued manufacturing expense and freight (included in accrued liabilities) as a result of lower operating activity during 2017, a decrease in account receivables resulting from higher collections and from taking a full reserve on Wynit's outstanding account receivables, offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily from an increase in income tax receivable due to expected refunds from prior tax years and from an insurance receivable due to a litigation settlement. The net change in operating assets and liabilities was also impacted by non-cash adjustments of $340.3 million, primarily resulting from a valuation allowance recorded against our U.S. deferred tax assets of $173.8 million, stock-based compensation expense of $91.6 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $45.7 million, provision for inventory obsolescence of $14.8 million, and provision for doubtful accounts of $7.9 million, partially offset by a net loss of $277.2 million. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, calculated as the number of days represented by the accounts receivable balance as of period end, decreased from 85 days as of December 31, 2016 to 76 days as of December 31, 2017 due to higher collections during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $138.7 million for 2016 was primarily due to an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $199.2 million and non-cash adjustments of $42.3 million, partially offset by a net loss of $102.8\nmillion. The increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $259.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, largely driven by increases in the product warranty reserve, sales rebates accruals, and reserves for excess components, partially offset by a $62.0 million increase in inventories, a $37.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and an $8.7 million increase in accounts receivable. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and the abandonment of property and equipment, partially offset by deferred taxes. Our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased from 56 days as of December 31, 2015 to 85 days as of December 31, 2016 due to slower collections in the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for 2018 of $17.5 million was primarily due to maturities and sales of marketable securities of $443.6 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $353.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $52.9 million, the cash portion of an acquisition of $13.6 million, net of cash acquired, and acquisition-related holdback payments of $5.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2017 of $28.7 million was primarily due to maturities and sales of marketable securities of $664.9 million, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of $597.9 million, purchases of property and equipment of $89.2 million, an equity investment of $6.0 million, and an asset purchase of $0.6 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for 2016 of $392.7 million was due to the purchases of marketable securities of $638.1 million, partially offset by the sale and maturities of marketable securities of $362.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $78.6 million, and the cash portion of acquisitions of $38.3 million, net of cash acquired.\nWe may continue to use cash in the future to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings. Due to the nature of these transactions, it is difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements to complete such transactions. We may be required to raise additional funds to complete future acquisitions.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2018 of $1.3 million was primarily due to $21.5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases made through our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the 2015 ESPP, offset in part by $19.4 million in net cash used for payment of taxes on common stock issued under our employee equity incentive plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2017 of $4.6 million was primarily due to $19.0 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases made through our 2015 ESPP, offset in part by $14.4 million in net cash used for payment of taxes on common stock issued under our employee equity incentive plans.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for 2016 of $19.8 million was primarily related to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee equity incentive plans of $21.0 million.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nYears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>146,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>2,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents expected future minimum lease payments, net of minimum sublease rental income, under noncancellable operating leases for our facilities.

The aggregate amount of open purchase orders as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $517.6 million, of which $185.0 million related to our transition to a third-party hosting provider and $2.9 million was accrued for as of December 31, 2018. We cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled\nby our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics providers within short periods of time. We subcontract with other companies to manufacture our products.\nDuring the normal course of business, we and our contract manufacturers procure components based upon a forecasted production plan. If we cancel all or part of the orders, or materially reduce forecasted orders, we may be liable to our suppliers and contract manufacturers for the cost of the excess components purchased by our contract manufacturers. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $10.8 million was accrued for such liabilities to contract manufacturers.\nThe table above excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions of $27.7 million as of December 31, 2018, due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements will become due.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and do not have any holdings in variable interest entities.\nCritical Accounting Polices and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's estimates, assumptions, and judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers at transaction price, an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Transaction price is calculated as selling price net of variable consideration which may include estimates for future returns and sales incentives related to current period product revenue.\nProducts and Services\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from sales of our wearable devices, which includes trackers, smartwatches and accessories. We also generate a small portion of revenue from our subscription-based services. We consider delivery of our products to have occurred once control has transferred and delivery of services to have occurred as control is transferred. We recognize revenue, net of estimated sales returns, sales incentives, discounts, and sales tax.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nWe enter into contracts that have multiple performance obligations that include hardware, software, and services. The first performance obligation is the hardware and firmware essential to the functionality of the tracker or smartwatch delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the software services included with the products, which are provided free of charge and enable users to sync, view, and access real-time data on our online dashboard and mobile apps. The third performance obligation is the embedded right included with the purchase of the device to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified firmware upgrades and features relating to the product's essential firmware. In addition, we occasionally offer a fourth performance obligation in bundled arrangements that allows access to subscription-based services related to our Fitbit Coach offering.\nWe allocate revenue to all performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d). Our process for determining SSP considers multiple factors including consumer behaviors, our internal pricing model, and cost-plus margin, and may vary depending upon the facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. SSP for the trackers and smartwatches reflect our best estimate of the selling prices if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis and comprise the majority of the arrangement consideration. SSP for upgrade rights currently ranges from $1.00 to $3.00. SSP for the online dashboard and mobile apps is currently estimated at $0.99. SSP for access to Fitbit Coach subscription-based services is based on the price charged when sold separately.\nAmounts allocated to the delivered wearable devices are recognized at the time of delivery, provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the online dashboard and mobile apps and unspecified upgrade rights are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated usage period.\nWe offer our users the ability to purchase subscription-based services, through which the users receive incremental features, including access to a digital personal trainer, in-depth analytics regarding the user's personal metrics, or video-based customized workouts. Amounts paid for subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over the service period, which is typically one year. Revenue from subscription-based services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nIn addition, we offer subscription-based software and services to certain customers in Fitness Health Solutions, which includes a real-time dashboard, and the ability to create corporate challenges. SSP for the Fitness Health Solutions subscription is determined based on our internal pricing model for anticipated renewals for existing customers and pricing for new customers. Revenue allocated to the Fitness Health Solutions subscription is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated access period of one year, which is the typical service period. Revenue for Fitness Health Solutions software and services was less than 1% of revenue for all periods presented.\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract with a customer as incurred when the amortization period would be one year or less. We apply a practical expedient to not consider the effect of a significant financing component as we expect that the period between transfer of control and payment from customer to be one year or less.\nWe account for shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenue. Sales taxes and value added taxes, or VAT, collected from customers which are remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue, and are reflected as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRights of Return, Stock Rotation Rights, and Price Protection\nWe offer limited rights of return, stock rotation rights, and price protection under various policies and programs with our retailer and distributor customers and end-users. Below is a summary of the general provisions of such policies and programs:\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retailers and distributors are generally allowed to return products that were originally sold through to an end-user under provisions of their contracts, called open-box\u201d returns, and such returns may be made at any time after the original sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>All purchases through Fitbit.com are covered by a 45-day right of return.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain distributors are allowed stock rotation rights which are limited rights of return of products purchased during a prior period, generally one quarter.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Certain distributors are offered price protection that allows for the right to a partial credit for unsold inventory held by the distributor if we reduce the selling price of a product.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate reserves for these policies and programs based on historical experience, and record the reserve as a reduction of revenue and an accrued liability. Through December 31, 2018, actual returns have primarily been open-box returns. On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved for future returns is calculated based on historical trends and data specific to each reporting period. The historical trends consider product life cycles, new product introductions, market acceptance of products, product sell-through, the type of customer, seasonality, and other factors. Return rates can fluctuate over time, but have been sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns. We review the actual returns evidenced in prior quarters as a percent of related revenue to determine the historical rate of returns. We then apply the historical rate of returns to the current period revenue as a basis for estimating future returns. When necessary, we also provide a specific reserve for products in the distribution channel in excess of estimated requirements. This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, product plans, and other factors. We also consider whether there are circumstances which may result in anticipated returns higher than the historical return rate from direct customers and record an additional specific reserve as necessary. The estimates and assumptions used to reserve for rights of return, stock rotation rights, and price protection have been accurate in all material respects and have not materially changed in the past.\nSales Incentives\nWe offer sales incentives through various programs, consisting primarily of cooperative advertising and pricing promotions to retailers and distributors. We record advertising with customers as a reduction to revenue unless we receive a distinct benefit in exchange for credits claimed by the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the distinct benefit received, in\nwhich case we record it as a marketing expense. We recognize a liability and reduce revenue for rebates or other incentives based on the estimated amount of rebates or credits that will be claimed by customers.\nInventories\nInventories consist of finished goods and component parts, which are purchased from contract manufacturers and component suppliers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We assess the valuation of inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions.\nProduct Warranty\nWe offer a standard product warranty that our products will operate under normal use for a period of one-year from the date of original purchase, except in the European Union and certain Asia Pacific countries where we provide a two-year warranty. We have the obligation, at our option, to either repair or replace a defective product. At the time revenue is recognized, an estimate of future warranty costs is recorded as a component of cost of revenues. The estimate of future warranty costs is based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures, if any, that are outside of our typical experience. We regularly review these estimates to assess the appropriateness of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates, service delivery costs incurred in correcting the product failures, and warranty policies. Our products are manufactured by contract manufacturers, and in certain cases, we may have recourse against such contract manufacturers. Should actual product failure rates, use of materials or other costs differ from our estimates, additional warranty liabilities could be incurred, which could materially affect our results of operations. The estimates and assumptions used to reserve for product warranty have been accurate in all material respects and have not materially changed in the past.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill, and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to tangible assets, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. These estimates can include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows of acquired customers, acquired technology, and trade names from a market participant perspective, and estimates of useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Consistent with our determination that we have one operating segment, we have determined that there is one reporting unit and test goodwill for impairment at the entity level. We test goodwill using the two-step process in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In the first step, we compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value based on the fair value of our common stock. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, goodwill is potentially impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed. In the second step, we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill, as defined by ASC 350, to our carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss, if any. We tested goodwill for impairment as of October 31, 2018 and 2017, and the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value. We considered other factors in the performance of the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2018, including assumptions about expected future revenue forecasts, changes in the overall economy, trends in our stock price, and other operating conditions. It is reasonably possible that we could perform significantly below our expectations or a deterioration of market and economic conditions could occur. This would adversely impact our ability to meet our projected results, which could cause our goodwill to become impaired. If we determine that our goodwill is impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash charge that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. We make estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine our expense (benefit) for income taxes and also for deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets. We assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nThe calculation of our income tax expense involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of future tax audits. We have established reserves to address potential exposures related to tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our estimates, assumptions, and judgments to be reasonable, any changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe calculation of our deferred tax asset balance involves the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments while taking into account estimates of the amounts and type of future taxable income. Actual future operating results and the underlying amount and type of income could differ materially from our estimates, assumptions and judgments, thereby impacting our financial position and operating results.\nWe include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits have been recognized in the appropriate periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the applicable award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, without market conditions is the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We estimate the fair value of RSUs subject to market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of the fair value is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards, and risk-free interest rates.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and warrants and shares issued under our 2015 ESPP. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock options and warrants and shares issued under our 2015 ESPP using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, our expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the stock options and warrants, the expected term of the stock option and warrants, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:\nFair Value of Our Common Stock. The fair value of our stock options, warrants and RSUs are based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term represents the period over which we anticipate stock-based awards to be outstanding. We do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term due to the limited period of time stock-based awards have been exercisable. As a result, for stock options and warrants, we used the simplified method to calculate the expected term estimate based on the vesting and contractual terms of the stock option. Under the simplified method, the expected term is equal to the average of the stock-based award's weighted average vesting period and its contractual term. The expected term of equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP is the contractual term.\nVolatility. Expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which the stock price is expected to fluctuate. Prior to 2018, we estimated the expected volatility of the common stock underlying our stock options, warrants and equity awards issued under our 2015 ESPP at the grant date by taking the average historical volatility of the common stock of a group of comparable publicly traded companies over a period equal to the expected life. We used this method because we had limited information on the volatility of our Class A common stock because of our short trading history. Beginning in 2018, we now use a combination of historical volatility from our Class A common stock along with historical volatility from the group of comparable publicly traded companies.\nRisk-Free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is the estimated average interest rate based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon notes with terms consistent with the expected term of the awards.\nDividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the stock-based awards represent management judgment. As a result, if factors change and different assumptions are used, the stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and operations of the company, discussing the sources of revenue, key products, operating efficiencies, and future factors affecting performance.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nToday, most of our revenue comes from the sale of wearable devices, including both trackers and smartwatches. Our products are available in 87 countries worldwide through a variety of channels, including 39,000 retail stores, retailer websites, Fitbit.com and through Fitbit Health Solutions.\nIn 2018, we focused on providing more choice and accessibility to consumers in wearables to drive acquisition of users. We introduced Fitbit Versa, our first mass appeal smartwatch in the second quarter, resulting in increased smartwatch revenue over the course of 2018. Smartwatch revenue increased to 44% of revenue in 2018, from 8% in 2017. We also launched Fitbit Charge 3, which innovates on our Charge family of trackers, and which has sold more than 38 million devices. It gives people health and fitness features in a slim, premium tracker design, with smart functionality, and long battery life at an affordable price. The introduction of Fitbit Ace, a tracker designed for kids ages 8 and up and Fitbit family accounts, also expanded our addressable market.\nThe mix shift towards smartwatches favorably impacted the average selling price of our devices, but negatively impact our gross margin. This was partially mitigated by improvement in operating efficiency. Operating efficiencies were driven by four key areas: returns, warranty claims, product quality and customer support costs.\nAcquiring customers through the sale of a device increases the size of our community of users and also increases the potential for future demand for devices and other monetization opportunities, such as software services or coaching revenue. While software revenue was immaterial in 2018, a growing community of active users provides us an opportunity to introduce or further develop software services for the community in the future.\nIn addition, we focused on growing our Fitbit Health Solutions channel, which delivers health and wellness solutions for employers, health plans and health systems. In the fall, we launched Fitbit Care, a connected health platform that combines health coaching and virtual care, wearable devices, and personalized digital interventions to better support patients outside the walls of the clinical environment. While revenue from the Fitbit Health Solutions channel was immaterial in 2018, growth of the channel provides us an opportunity to drive demand for devices and software services.\nThe following are financial highlights for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.\n\nDevices Sold\nDevices sold represents the number of wearable devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings with differing U.S. manufacturer's suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.\nActive Users\nFitbit builds its community of users through device sales and investment in its software to drive engagement. We define an active user as a registered Fitbit user who, within the three months prior to the date of measurement, has (a) an active Fitbit Coach subscription, (b) paired a wearable device or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account, or (c) logged at least 100 steps with a wearable device or a weight measurement using an Aria scale. Active users can be new users who joined the community during the past ninety days, existing users who have remained active and met our definition of an active user, or previously active users who were inactive for 90 days or greater. The active user number excludes users who have downloaded our mobile apps without purchasing any of our wearable devices and users who have downloaded free versions of Fitbit Coach but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nThe active user metric is intended to provide a snapshot of the potential size and growth of our engaged user community. We believe interest in health and fitness ebbs and flows and as such, the active user metric is not designed to be a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period. Accordingly, this metric does not take into account the extent to which inactive users are offset by new active users or how long an individual user remains active.\nThe number of active users is based on activity associated with each Fitbit user account. A user establishes an account with us by registering his or her email with us at Fitbit.com or through our app. As such, the active user metric reflects the number of Fitbit users who meet our definition of an active user during the measurement period; it is not associated with the particular device(s) owned by a user. Accordingly, a user with multiple devices synced to his or her account would only be counted as one active user. As a percentage of the active user metric, users who logged at least 100 steps with a health and fitness tracker or a weight measurement using an Aria scale but had an existing user account in a prior quarter increased from 79% as of December 31, 2017 to 82% percent as of December 31, 2018.\nHowever, it is also possible to have multiple active users associated with a single device at different points in time, such as with users who acquired a refurbished device and with users who acquired a device directly from another user. In such cases, particularly the latter instance, it is also possible that the prior owner and new owner of a single device could each be counted as unique active users during the same measurement period. However, we believe it is appropriate to include both new and prior owners of a particular device in the active user metric because the metric is intended to provide a snapshot of the potential size and growth of our engaged user community during the measurement period. Since both the new and prior owners meet the active user metric, we believe both users would be appropriately included in the active user metric as both users independently have demonstrated a level of engagement with our devices and platform.\nIn addition, the active user metric is not intended to be an indicator of device sales in any period, as device sales are reported as a separate metric. We do not believe that the active user metric has a direct effect on our revenue and operating results since substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from sales of our wearable devices. However, we believe the size of our active user population is a potential indicator of future demand from repeat buyers for our devices and for other future monetization opportunities such as software services or coaching revenue. We aim to increase the active user metric by developing products, services and content that are compelling for new, existing, and prior users.\nActivations - Repeat and Re-Activated Users\nWe define an Activation\u201d as the first instance of a Fitbit device (excluding Aria, Aria 2, Flyer and other accessories) pairing to a user account during the three months prior to the date of measurement. A Repeat User\u201d is defined as a Fitbit user who activated a Fitbit device to his or her account during the measurement period and activated a different Fitbit device to his or her account during a prior period. A Re-Activated User\u201d is defined as Repeat User who has not synced his or her prior device and taken at least 100 steps for 90 days or more prior to the measurement period with such device.\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2018, 35.1% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 56.5% of those Repeat Users. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, 32.6% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 47.1% of those Repeat Users. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 37.6% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 52.0% of those Repeat Users. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 36.9% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 41.3% of those Repeat Users. We calculated the full year Activation metric by summing the Activations from Repeat Users and Re-Activated Users in each of the four quarters in 2018 and 2017. As such, a user who activated more than one Fitbit device to his or her account during the year and had activated a different Fitbit device in a prior year would count as a Repeat User more than once.\nWe believe that the Activations metric is a potential indicator of repeat purchase behavior but not a guarantee of repeat purchase behavior. Actual repeat purchase behavior may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to our ability to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, litigation expense related to matters with Aliphcom, Inc. d/b/a Jawbone, or Jawbone, the impact of our restructuring in 2017, the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, impairment of equity investment, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, change in contingent consideration, interest income (expense), net, and income tax expense (benefit). See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\nFree cash flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchase of property and equipment. See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures- Free cash flow\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nProduct Introductions\nTo date, product introductions have often had a significant, positive impact on our operating results due primarily to increases in revenue associated with sales of the new products in the quarters following their introduction. Furthermore, new product introductions, or NPI, which we define as new products shipped in the past 12 months, could also adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and users. New products may also have higher costs associated with them, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, we have incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and enhance our existing products, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases.\nInternational Expansion\nOur revenue, based on ship-to destinations, from sales outside of the United States represented 42% of our revenue in both 2017 and 2018. We believe our global opportunity is significant, and to address this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts, distribution channels, and infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sales of our products and services in international markets. Moreover, our international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nCategory Adoption, Expansion of our Total Addressable Market, and Market Growth\nAs a pioneer of the wearable device market, we believe we have contributed significantly to the market's growth. However, our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of wearable devices as a means to improve health and fitness and the growth of this market. In addition, our long-term growth depends in part on our ability to expand into adjacent markets in the future.\nCompetition\nThe market for wearable devices is both evolving and competitive. The wearable devices category has a multitude of participants, including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin and Withings, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, and Samsung. For example, Apple sells the Apple Watch, which is a smartwatch with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. Moreover, smartwatches with health and fitness functionalities may displace the market for traditional tracker devices. For example, Apple's recently introduced Apple Watch includes ECG functionality and fall detection capability. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, we have experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For example, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, our fourth quarter represented 38%, 35% and 26% of our annual revenue, respectively. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods.\nInvesting in Growth\nOur business is in a multi-year transition process where we expect to leverage our core assets of brand, community, and data to focus on four key areas: adapting to the changing wearable device market; deepening our reach within healthcare; increasing our agility and optimizing our cost structure; and transforming our business from an episodic driven model centered around device sales to more life time value and recurring revenue. We expect our device mix to continue to shift towards smartwatches in 2019. This will benefit average selling price, but will not offset the decline in our tracker unit growth. We expect the device mix shift to negatively impact gross margins, partially offset by operating efficiencies. For the full year 2019, operating expenses are expected to decline in absolute dollars as compared to the full year 2018. We intend to drive incremental margin on the device side of the business and redeploy capital to grow international sales, Fitbit Health Solutions and recurring revenue opportunities.\nWe also expect to leverage the strength of our partners or acquire where necessary to increase speed to market and our ability to scale the business more effectively. For example, in 2016 we acquired assets from Coin, Pebble and Vector Watch to enhance the features and functionality of our devices, accelerate the expansion of our platform and ecosystem, and grow our capabilities in lower cost regions of the world. In 2018 we acquired Twine Health to further extend our reach into healthcare and to lay the foundation to expand our offerings to health plans, health systems and self-insured employers, including the introduction of Fitbit Care, a connected health platform for health plans and employers, in the third quarter of 2018, while creating opportunities to increase our subscription-based revenue.\nFurthermore, we intend to increase our focus on the health ecosystem, building relationships with employers, wellness providers, and payers. The corporate wellness market for wearable devices market is new and is subject to a variety of challenges, including whether employers, health systems, and payers will continue to invest in such programs, long sales cycles, and substantial upfront sales costs. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived less than 10% of our revenue from our Fitbit Health Solutions offerings. However, we believe that as healthcare costs continue to rise and as the healthcare ecosystem continues to seek ways to manage their costs, this represents an opportunity to grow revenue. In order to grow our Fitbit Health Solutions presence, we intend to enhance our offerings as well as expand our sales team focused on this market.\nProduct Quality\nWe sell complex products and services that could contain design and manufacturing defects in their materials, hardware, and firmware. These defects could include defective materials or components, or bugs,\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the products' intended operations or cause injuries to users or property. Although we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products and services before their release, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. In addition, we utilize products and services provided by third-parties, such as vendors and contract manufacturers, and we rely on their\nrepresentations and do not have full control over their processes. Failure to detect, prevent, or fix defects, or an increase in defects could result in a variety of consequences including a greater number of returns of products than expected from users and retailers, increases in warranty costs, regulatory proceedings, product recalls, and litigation, which could harm our revenue and operating results.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe have three sources of revenue: consumer device revenue, Fitbit Health Solutions revenue, and consumer non-device revenue. The vast majority of our total revenue comes from the sale of wearable devices through the retail, direct, and Fitbit Health Solutions channels. Within the Fitbit Health Solutions channel, revenue is comprised of devices, services, and software with most of it driven by device sales. Consumer non-device revenue represents a small portion of total revenue, primarily from our subscription-based Fitbit Coach services.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our wearable devices, which includes both trackers and accessories and smartwatches sold both directly to consumers as well as through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based Fitbit Coach services and from software services sold through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, hosting costs, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and change in contingent consideration.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses represent a significant component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, POP display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, allocated overhead, information technology, bad debt expense, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists of foreign currency gains and losses, and impairment loss from an equity investment.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.\nOn July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation. This opinion reversed the prior decision of the United States Tax Court. On August 7, 2018, the Court withdrew the opinion issued on July 24, 2018 to allow time for a reconstituted panel of judges to confer. We will continue to monitor the case.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act, was signed into law and includes several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, elimination of certain deductions, and changes to how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as re-assessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018, we finalized all provisional amounts related to the 2017 Tax Act. Finalizing provisional adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of operating results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\n\n (1) Includes stock-based compensation expense as follows: \n\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue decreased $103.5 million, or 6%, from $1.6 billion for 2017 to $1.5 billion for 2018. The decrease was primarily from a 9% reduction in devices sold driven by a decline in the demand for our trackers as the wearable market shifted from trackers to smartwatches. This shift adversely impacted us since trackers represented the majority of our revenue in 2017. Our tracker decline was partially offset by the growth in sales of our smartwatches, primarily from our introduction of Fitbit Versa in 2018, our first mass appeal smartwatch, which has enabled us to participate in the faster growing portion of the wearables device market. As a result, our smartwatch revenue grew by 437%, from 8% of our revenue in 2017 to 44% of our revenue in 2018, and our tracker revenue declined by 44%, from 88% of our revenue in 2017 to 53% of our revenue in 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year. The product mix shift towards higher end smartwatches favorably impacted the ASP of our devices. ASP increased by 4%, from $101 in 2017 to $105 in 2018. During 2018, we benefited from an improved lower rate of product returns and from $12.4 million in revenue from the release of outstanding product return and rebate reserves related to Wynit, as we believe the possibility of future claims associated with these reserves is remote. Revenue from NPI increased by 74%, from $498.3 million, or 31% of revenue, in 2017, to $869.4 million, or 57% of revenue, in 2018. NPI revenue for 2018 was primarily from Fitbit Versa, Fitbit Charge 3 and Fitbit Ace. Revenue from our direct channel, Fitbit.com, decreased by 8% to $154.7 million, or 10% of revenue in 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in our direct channel revenue was primarily due to a decline in discounted sales derived from customer claims. In response to customer complaints about out of warranty devices, we offer certain customers discounts on new products in lieu of providing replacements. These discounts are generally redeemed through our direct channel. The improved quality of our products has resulted in fewer customer complaints and, as a result, the issuance of fewer discount offers, therefore driving a decrease in direct channel revenue. Revenue from accessories declined by 32% and software services increased by 29%, compared to the prior fiscal year.\nRevenue decreased $553.9 million, or 26%, from $2.2 billion for 2016 to $1.6 billion for 2017. Our 2017 results reflect lower demand for our trackers as consumers started migrating towards higher-end smartwatches, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily in the United States. A substantial majority of the decrease was due to a 31% decline in the number of devices sold, from 22.3 million in 2016 to 15.3 million in 2017. The decrease was offset in part by an 8% increase in the average selling price of our devices, from $94 for 2016", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section titled Selected Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed above in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nToday, most of our revenue comes from the sale of wearable devices, including both trackers and smartwatches. Our products are available in 87 countries worldwide through a variety of channels, including 39,000 retail stores, retailer websites, Fitbit.com and through Fitbit Health Solutions.\nIn 2018, we focused on providing more choice and accessibility to consumers in wearables to drive acquisition of users. We introduced Fitbit Versa, our first mass appeal smartwatch in the second quarter, resulting in increased smartwatch revenue over the course of 2018. Smartwatch revenue increased to 44% of revenue in 2018, from 8% in 2017. We also launched Fitbit Charge 3, which innovates on our Charge family of trackers, and which has sold more than 38 million devices. It gives people health and fitness features in a slim, premium tracker design, with smart functionality, and long battery life at an affordable price. The introduction of Fitbit Ace, a tracker designed for kids ages 8 and up and Fitbit family accounts, also expanded our addressable market.\nThe mix shift towards smartwatches favorably impacted the average selling price of our devices, but negatively impact our gross margin. This was partially mitigated by improvement in operating efficiency. Operating efficiencies were driven by four key areas: returns, warranty claims, product quality and customer support costs.\nAcquiring customers through the sale of a device increases the size of our community of users and also increases the potential for future demand for devices and other monetization opportunities, such as software services or coaching revenue. While software revenue was immaterial in 2018, a growing community of active users provides us an opportunity to introduce or further develop software services for the community in the future.\nIn addition, we focused on growing our Fitbit Health Solutions channel, which delivers health and wellness solutions for employers, health plans and health systems. In the fall, we launched Fitbit Care, a connected health platform that combines health coaching and virtual care, wearable devices, and personalized digital interventions to better support patients outside the walls of the clinical environment. While revenue from the Fitbit Health Solutions channel was immaterial in 2018, growth of the channel provides us an opportunity to drive demand for devices and software services.\nThe following are financial highlights for 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,511,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,615,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,169,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(185,829\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(277,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(102,777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nKey Business Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended and As Of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Devices sold\n</td> <td>13,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active users\n</td> <td>27,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52,158\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,919\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDevices Sold\nDevices sold represents the number of wearable devices that are sold during a period, net of expected returns. Devices sold does not include sales of accessories. Growth rates between devices sold and revenue are not necessarily correlated because our revenue is affected by other variables, such as the types of products sold during the period, the introduction of new product offerings with differing U.S. manufacturer's suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, and sales of accessories and premium services.\nActive Users\nFitbit builds its community of users through device sales and investment in its software to drive engagement. We define an active user as a registered Fitbit user who, within the three months prior to the date of measurement, has (a) an active Fitbit Coach subscription, (b) paired a wearable device or Aria scale with his or her Fitbit account, or (c) logged at least 100 steps with a wearable device or a weight measurement using an Aria scale. Active users can be new users who joined the community during the past ninety days, existing users who have remained active and met our definition of an active user, or previously active users who were inactive for 90 days or greater. The active user number excludes users who have downloaded our mobile apps without purchasing any of our wearable devices and users who have downloaded free versions of Fitbit Coach but are not subscribers to its paid premium offerings.\nThe active user metric is intended to provide a snapshot of the potential size and growth of our engaged user community. We believe interest in health and fitness ebbs and flows and as such, the active user metric is not designed to be a measure of the levels of continuous engagement of our individual users and does not track the number of individual users that have become inactive on our platform in a period. Accordingly, this metric does not take into account the extent to which inactive users are offset by new active users or how long an individual user remains active.\nThe number of active users is based on activity associated with each Fitbit user account. A user establishes an account with us by registering his or her email with us at Fitbit.com or through our app. As such, the active user metric reflects the number of Fitbit users who meet our definition of an active user during the measurement period; it is not associated with the particular device(s) owned by a user. Accordingly, a user with multiple devices synced to his or her account would only be counted as one active user. As a percentage of the active user metric, users who logged at least 100 steps with a health and fitness tracker or a weight measurement using an Aria scale but had an existing user account in a prior quarter increased from 79% as of December 31, 2017 to 82% percent as of December 31, 2018.\nHowever, it is also possible to have multiple active users associated with a single device at different points in time, such as with users who acquired a refurbished device and with users who acquired a device directly from another user. In such cases, particularly the latter instance, it is also possible that the prior owner and new owner of a single device could each be counted as unique active users during the same measurement period. However, we believe it is appropriate to include both new and prior owners of a particular device in the active user metric because the metric is intended to provide a snapshot of the potential size and growth of our engaged user community during the measurement period. Since both the new and prior owners meet the active user metric, we believe both users would be appropriately included in the active user metric as both users independently have demonstrated a level of engagement with our devices and platform.\nIn addition, the active user metric is not intended to be an indicator of device sales in any period, as device sales are reported as a separate metric. We do not believe that the active user metric has a direct effect on our revenue and operating results since substantially all of our revenue to date has been derived from sales of our wearable devices. However, we believe the size of our active user population is a potential indicator of future demand from repeat buyers for our devices and for other future monetization opportunities such as software services or coaching revenue. We aim to increase the active user metric by developing products, services and content that are compelling for new, existing, and prior users.\nActivations - Repeat and Re-Activated Users\nWe define an Activation\u201d as the first instance of a Fitbit device (excluding Aria, Aria 2, Flyer and other accessories) pairing to a user account during the three months prior to the date of measurement. A Repeat User\u201d is defined as a Fitbit user who activated a Fitbit device to his or her account during the measurement period and activated a different Fitbit device to his or her account during a prior period. A Re-Activated User\u201d is defined as Repeat User who has not synced his or her prior device and taken at least 100 steps for 90 days or more prior to the measurement period with such device.\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2018, 35.1% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 56.5% of those Repeat Users. In the three months ended December 31, 2017, 32.6% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 47.1% of those Repeat Users. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 37.6% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 52.0% of those Repeat Users. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 36.9% of Activations came from Repeat Users, with Re-Activated Users representing 41.3% of those Repeat Users. We calculated the full year Activation metric by summing the Activations from Repeat Users and Re-Activated Users in each of the four quarters in 2018 and 2017. As such, a user who activated more than one Fitbit device to his or her account during the year and had activated a different Fitbit device in a prior year would count as a Repeat User more than once.\nWe believe that the Activations metric is a potential indicator of repeat purchase behavior but not a guarantee of repeat purchase behavior. Actual repeat purchase behavior may depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to our ability to anticipate and satisfy consumer preferences.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and intangible assets amortization, litigation expense related to matters with Aliphcom, Inc. d/b/a Jawbone, or Jawbone, the impact of our restructuring in 2017, the impact of the Fitbit Force recall, impairment of equity investment, the revaluation of our redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability prior to our initial public offering, or IPO, change in contingent consideration, interest income (expense), net, and income tax expense (benefit). See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures-Adjusted EBITDA\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss).\nFree cash flow\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchase of property and equipment. See the section titled Selected Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures- Free cash flow\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our use of free cash flow and a reconciliation of free cash flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.\nFactors Affecting Our Future Performance\nProduct Introductions\nTo date, product introductions have often had a significant, positive impact on our operating results due primarily to increases in revenue associated with sales of the new products in the quarters following their introduction. Furthermore, new product introductions, or NPI, which we define as new products shipped in the past 12 months, could also adversely impact the sales of our existing products to retailers and users. New products may also have higher costs associated with them, which could adversely affect our margins. In addition, we have incurred higher levels of sales and marketing expenses accompanying each product introduction. In the future, we intend to continue to release new products and enhance our existing products, and we expect that our operating results will be impacted by these releases.\nInternational Expansion\nOur revenue, based on ship-to destinations, from sales outside of the United States represented 42% of our revenue in both 2017 and 2018. We believe our global opportunity is significant, and to address this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest in sales and marketing efforts, distribution channels, and infrastructure and personnel to support our international expansion, including establishing additional sales offices globally. Our growth will depend in part on the adoption and sales of our products and services in international markets. Moreover, our international expansion efforts have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs and are subject to a variety of risks, including increased competition, uncertain enforcement of our intellectual property rights, more complex distribution logistics, and the complexity of compliance with foreign laws and regulations.\nCategory Adoption, Expansion of our Total Addressable Market, and Market Growth\nAs a pioneer of the wearable device market, we believe we have contributed significantly to the market's growth. However, our future growth depends in part on the continued consumer adoption of wearable devices as a means to improve health and fitness and the growth of this market. In addition, our long-term growth depends in part on our ability to expand into adjacent markets in the future.\nCompetition\nThe market for wearable devices is both evolving and competitive. The wearable devices category has a multitude of participants, including specialized consumer electronics companies such as Garmin and Withings, and traditional watch companies such as Fossil. In addition, many large, broad-based consumer electronics companies either compete in our market or adjacent markets or have announced plans to do so, including Apple, Google, LG, and Samsung. For example, Apple sells the Apple Watch, which is a smartwatch with broad-based functionalities, including some health and fitness tracking capabilities, and has sold a significant volume of its smartwatches since introduction. Moreover, smartwatches with health and fitness functionalities may displace the market for traditional tracker devices. For example, Apple's recently introduced Apple Watch includes ECG functionality and fall detection capability. We also face competition from manufacturers of lower-cost devices, such as Xiaomi and its Mi Band device. In addition, we compete with a wide range of stand-alone health and fitness-related mobile apps that can be purchased or downloaded through mobile app stores.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, we have experienced higher revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in large part to seasonal holiday demand. For example, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, our fourth quarter represented 38%, 35% and 26% of our annual revenue, respectively. We also incur higher sales and marketing expenses during these periods.\nInvesting in Growth\nOur business is in a multi-year transition process where we expect to leverage our core assets of brand, community, and data to focus on four key areas: adapting to the changing wearable device market; deepening our reach within healthcare; increasing our agility and optimizing our cost structure; and transforming our business from an episodic driven model centered around device sales to more life time value and recurring revenue. We expect our device mix to continue to shift towards smartwatches in 2019. This will benefit average selling price, but will not offset the decline in our tracker unit growth. We expect the device mix shift to negatively impact gross margins, partially offset by operating efficiencies. For the full year 2019, operating expenses are expected to decline in absolute dollars as compared to the full year 2018. We intend to drive incremental margin on the device side of the business and redeploy capital to grow international sales, Fitbit Health Solutions and recurring revenue opportunities.\nWe also expect to leverage the strength of our partners or acquire where necessary to increase speed to market and our ability to scale the business more effectively. For example, in 2016 we acquired assets from Coin, Pebble and Vector Watch to enhance the features and functionality of our devices, accelerate the expansion of our platform and ecosystem, and grow our capabilities in lower cost regions of the world. In 2018 we acquired Twine Health to further extend our reach into healthcare and to lay the foundation to expand our offerings to health plans, health systems and self-insured employers, including the introduction of Fitbit Care, a connected health platform for health plans and employers, in the third quarter of 2018, while creating opportunities to increase our subscription-based revenue.\nFurthermore, we intend to increase our focus on the health ecosystem, building relationships with employers, wellness providers, and payers. The corporate wellness market for wearable devices market is new and is subject to a variety of challenges, including whether employers, health systems, and payers will continue to invest in such programs, long sales cycles, and substantial upfront sales costs. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, we derived less than 10% of our revenue from our Fitbit Health Solutions offerings. However, we believe that as healthcare costs continue to rise and as the healthcare ecosystem continues to seek ways to manage their costs, this represents an opportunity to grow revenue. In order to grow our Fitbit Health Solutions presence, we intend to enhance our offerings as well as expand our sales team focused on this market.\nProduct Quality\nWe sell complex products and services that could contain design and manufacturing defects in their materials, hardware, and firmware. These defects could include defective materials or components, or bugs,\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the products' intended operations or cause injuries to users or property. Although we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products and services before their release, there can be no assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. In addition, we utilize products and services provided by third-parties, such as vendors and contract manufacturers, and we rely on their\nrepresentations and do not have full control over their processes. Failure to detect, prevent, or fix defects, or an increase in defects could result in a variety of consequences including a greater number of returns of products than expected from users and retailers, increases in warranty costs, regulatory proceedings, product recalls, and litigation, which could harm our revenue and operating results.\nComponents of our Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe have three sources of revenue: consumer device revenue, Fitbit Health Solutions revenue, and consumer non-device revenue. The vast majority of our total revenue comes from the sale of wearable devices through the retail, direct, and Fitbit Health Solutions channels. Within the Fitbit Health Solutions channel, revenue is comprised of devices, services, and software with most of it driven by device sales. Consumer non-device revenue represents a small portion of total revenue, primarily from our subscription-based Fitbit Coach services.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our wearable devices, which includes both trackers and accessories and smartwatches sold both directly to consumers as well as through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel. We also generate a small portion of our revenue from our subscription-based Fitbit Coach services and from software services sold through our Fitbit Health Solutions channel.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of product costs, including costs of contract manufacturers for production, shipping and handling costs, warranty replacement costs, packaging, fulfillment costs, manufacturing and tooling equipment depreciation, warehousing costs, hosting costs, write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory, amortization of developed technology intangible assets acquired, and certain allocated costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses and other expenses associated with supply chain logistics. Personnel-related expenses include salaries, bonuses, benefits, and stock-based compensation.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and change in contingent consideration.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, and allocated overhead costs.\nSubstantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses represent a significant component of our operating expenses and consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products and services and personnel-related expenses, as well as sales incentives, trade show and event costs, sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, POP display expenses and related amortization, and allocated overhead costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses for our finance, legal, human resources, and administrative personnel, as well as the costs of professional services, allocated overhead, information technology, bad debt expense, amortization of intangible assets acquired, and other administrative expenses.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest expense associated with our debt financing arrangements, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net consists of foreign currency gains and losses, and impairment loss from an equity investment.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have statutory tax rates different from those in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to U.S. income, the utilization of foreign tax credits, and changes in tax laws.\nOn July 24, 2018, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement to share expenses related to share-based compensation. This opinion reversed the prior decision of the United States Tax Court. On August 7, 2018, the Court withdrew the opinion issued on July 24, 2018 to allow time for a reconstituted panel of judges to confer. We will continue to monitor the case.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the 2017 Tax Act, was signed into law and includes several key tax provisions that affected us, including a reduction of statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, elimination of certain deductions, and changes to how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations, among others. We are required to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as re-assessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018, we finalized all provisional amounts related to the 2017 Tax Act. Finalizing provisional adjustments related to the 2017 Tax Act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Results\nThe following tables set forth the components of our consolidated statements of operations for each of the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of operating results is not necessarily indicative of results for future periods.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

billion for 2017 to $1.5 billion for 2018. The decrease was primarily from a 9% reduction in devices sold driven by a decline in the demand for our trackers as the wearable market shifted from trackers to smartwatches. This shift adversely impacted us since trackers represented the majority of our revenue in 2017. Our tracker decline was partially offset by the growth in sales of our smartwatches, primarily from our introduction of Fitbit Versa in 2018, our first mass appeal smartwatch, which has enabled us to participate in the faster growing portion of the wearables device market. As a result, our smartwatch revenue grew by 437%, from 8% of our revenue in 2017 to 44% of our revenue in 2018, and our tracker revenue declined by 44%, from 88% of our revenue in 2017 to 53% of our revenue in 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year. The product mix shift towards higher end smartwatches favorably impacted the ASP of our devices. ASP increased by 4%, from $101 in 2017 to $105 in 2018. During 2018, we benefited from an improved lower rate of product returns and from $12.4 million in revenue from the release of outstanding product return and rebate reserves related to Wynit, as we believe the possibility of future claims associated with these reserves is remote. Revenue from NPI increased by 74%, from $498.3 million, or 31% of revenue, in 2017, to $869.4 million, or 57% of revenue, in 2018. NPI revenue for 2018 was primarily from Fitbit Versa, Fitbit Charge 3 and Fitbit Ace. Revenue from our direct channel, Fitbit.com, decreased by 8% to $154.7 million, or 10% of revenue in 2018, compared to the prior fiscal year. The decrease in our direct channel revenue was primarily due to a decline in discounted sales derived from customer claims. In response to customer complaints about out of warranty devices, we offer certain customers discounts on new products in lieu of providing replacements. These discounts are generally redeemed through our direct channel. The improved quality of our products has resulted in fewer customer complaints and, as a result, the issuance of fewer discount offers, therefore driving a decrease in direct channel revenue. Revenue from accessories declined by 32% and software services increased by 29%, compared to the prior fiscal year.\nRevenue decreased $553.9 million, or 26%, from $2.2 billion for 2016 to $1.6 billion for 2017. Our 2017 results reflect lower demand for our trackers as consumers started migrating towards higher-end smartwatches, compared to the same period in 2016, primarily in the United States. A substantial majority of the decrease was due to a 31% decline in the number of devices sold, from 22.3 million in 2016 to 15.3 million in 2017. The decrease was offset in part by an 8% increase in the average selling price of our devices, from $94 for 2016"}
