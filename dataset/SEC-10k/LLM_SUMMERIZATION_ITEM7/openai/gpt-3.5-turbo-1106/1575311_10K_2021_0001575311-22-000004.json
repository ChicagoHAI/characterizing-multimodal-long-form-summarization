Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto that appear in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company's future plans of operations, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any document, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nOverview and Background\nBrookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. ( Brookfield DTLA\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended, and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A preferred stock\u201d) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, MPG\u201d). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DTLA Holdings\u201d, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the Manager\u201d). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ( BPY\u201d), an exempted limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda, which in turn is the flagship commercial property entity and the primary vehicle through which Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAM\u201d), a corporation under the Laws of Canada, invests in real estate on a global basis. On April 1, 2021, BAM and BPY announced an agreement for BAM to acquire 100% of the limited partnership units of BPY. The acquisition was completed in July 2021 and the acquisition did not have any impact to the Company.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA owns and manages six Class A office properties and a retail center, consisting of 7,580,957 rentable square feet in total. Additionally, Brookfield DTLA also has an indirect noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns a multifamily residential development property. All of these properties are located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the LACBD\u201d) in Downtown Los Angeles, which has long been a major office district for law firms, accounting firms and government agencies. The following table sets forth information regarding these eight properties as of December 31, 2021:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Name </td> <td> </td> <td>Property Type </td> <td> </td> <td>Rentable Square Feet </td> <td> </td> <td>Ownership Percentage </td> <td> </td> <td>Occupancy (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted-Average Remaining Lease Term (Years) (2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank of America Plaza ( BOA Plaza\u201d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Office (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,405,428 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>85.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo Center-North Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Office (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,400,639 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>79.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.9 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gas Company Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Office (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,345,163 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>73.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EY Plaza </td> <td> </td> <td>Office (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>963,682 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>78.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo Center-South Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Office (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,124,960 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>63.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>777 Tower </td> <td> </td> <td>Office (4) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,024,835 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>79.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FIGat7th </td> <td> </td> <td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td>316,250 </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>89.4% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>755 South Figueroa </td> <td> </td> <td>Multifamily (3) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>33.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,580,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents properties' leased square feet over total rentable square feet for executed leases as of December 31, 2021.\n(2) Represents weighted-average of the period remaining (denominated in years) for executed lease as of December 31, 2021, excluding tenant lease extension options.\n(3) Under development as of December 31, 2021.\n(4) Classified as Class A office properties as they are centrally-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings.\nBrookfield DTLA primarily receives its income from lease income, including tenant reimbursements, generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, revenue from its parking garages.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nCoronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) Update\nIn December 2020, the U.S. began a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaign. On June 15, 2021, as California fully reopened its economy, restrictions such as physical distancing, capacity limits and the county tier system were lifted (the Reopening\u201d). However, since the Reopening, the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants brought uncertainty to the economic recovery and many office tenants revised their return-to-office plans in response to the soaring case counts.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDuring 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic have continued to impact numerous aspects of our business and our properties, which are located in the City of Los Angeles. Some of the effects include the following:\n\u2022Prior to the Reopening, capacity limits were imposed on higher-risk activities and businesses such as indoor dining, bars, fitness centers and movie theaters according to the tier system of the California state's reopening framework. As a result, our retail tenants in FIGat7th experienced the most immediate impact of the restrictions imposed. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, total lease income and parking revenue from FIGat7th represented approximately 5%, 3% and 4%, respectively, of the consolidated total. Due to the uncertainties posed to our tenants in FIGat7th by these restrictions, adjustments of $2.3 million were recognized during 2020, to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable. In contrast, the Company recorded favorable lease income adjustments of $0.5 million during 2021, as a result of the Reopening as various retail tenants benefited from higher visitor traffic.\n\u2022While our office properties have remained open, most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the stay-at-home\u201d order was issued in March 2020. Although state and local authorities lifted restrictions on businesses in June 2021, the physical occupancy of our office properties has remained well below capacity as infection rates fluctuated and most employers continued their COVID-19 response protocols and allowed employees to work from home when possible. As of December 31, 2021, most of our office tenants have been current in paying amounts due to us under their leases. Due to the uncertainties posed to our office property tenants by the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020, adjustments of $6.1 million were recognized to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable. In contrast, the Company recorded favorable lease income adjustments of $0.7 million during 2021, as a result of the Reopening and office employees returning to offices.\n\u2022The Company received certain rent relief requests for certain periods in 2020 and 2021 from many of our retail tenants and some of our office tenants as a result of the measures taken to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our tenants have availed themselves of various federal and state relief funds, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, which can be utilized to partially meet rental obligations. While our tenants are required to fulfill their commitments to us under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to carefully consider temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements on a lease-by-lease basis and only consider those which have a justifiable financial basis.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n\u2022The following table presents parking net operating income during 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019\n% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(30) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking expense </td> <td>(8,570) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,373) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking net operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecrease in parking net operating income is mainly attributable to the restrictions imposed by state and local authorities that impact the physical occupancy of both our office and retail properties.\n\u2022Decline in property values resulting from lower than anticipated revenues due to reduced increases in forecasted rental rates on new or renewal leases, applied credit losses, lower leasing velocity and increased lease concessions or incentives. While the carrying values of the properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, we estimate the undiscounted cashflows and fair values of the properties as part of our impairment review of investments in real estate.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Rents, Deferred Rents and Other Receivables, Net\u201d for a discussion of how we assess the collectibility of amounts due under leases with our tenants.\nIn addition, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that the COVID-19 pandemic directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nWhile we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impact of COVID-19, we expect impacts of COVID-19 to continue affecting our financial results at least through 2022, albeit modestly. The future impact of the pandemic on the demand for office space is unclear, as companies consider the repercussion of the pandemic on their business and their demand for labor while, at the same time, evaluate their space requirements in light of their current and projected headcounts and the continued focus on social distancing and employees' desire for more work-location flexibility.\nLeasing Activity and Occupancy Level\nFollowing the Reopening, leasing activity improved with new and renewal leases totaling 492,367 square feet within our portfolio in 2021, compared to 414,577 square feet in 2020, an increase of 19% year over year. Contractual expirations and early terminations of leases totaled 632,280 square feet in 2021, compared to 707,209 square feet in 2020, a decrease of 11% year over year. Despite the slight improvement in leasing activity, occupancy decreased from 79.1% in 2020 to 77.2% in 2021 due to the negative net absorption. See Leasing Activity\u201d for details.\nFinancing\nIn February 2021, Brookfield DTLA closed a $465.0 million interest-only debt secured by Gas Company Tower. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in February 2026, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95%. All the proceeds from this debt were used to pay off the original $450.0 million debt that previously encumbered the property and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. See \"Indebtedness\" for details.\nCapital Improvements\nThe atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center was completed in 2020 and the construction of the various food vendor spaces is in progress with openings starting in the second quarter of 2021 and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn 2020 and 2021, in response to the measures taken to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. Further, expenditures for tenant improvements has continued to decline as a result of decreased leasing activity in 2020 and 2021. Accordingly, expenditures for real estate improvements decreased by $65.3 million or 83% from $78.5 million in 2020 to $13.2 million in 2021. We anticipate that capital improvement activities will resume gradually starting 2022, as the economy continues to recover.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n755 South Figueroa Development\nThe 755 South Figueroa multifamily site is held by an unconsolidated real estate joint venture in which the Company had an ownership interest of 33.6%. As of December 31, 2021, construction is actively underway with core concrete construction complete through eight levels of parking and thirty eight floors of the superblock. Substantial completion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022 and will accommodate 785 rental units, approximately 5,300 square feet of retail space and 800 parking spaces. As the development progresses towards the targeted completion in 2022, $172.3 million was capitalized as development cost during 2021, compared to $76.4 million during 2020. As such, during 2021, additional capital contributions of $39.8 million, compared to $13.6 million in 2020, were made by DTLA FP IV Holdings to fund development costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nThe following table presents the major sources of Brookfield DTLA's liquidity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused capital contribution commitments available on Series B preferred interest </td> <td>21,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,678 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under secured debt to fund approved leasing costs\n</td> <td>72,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>156,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrookfield DTLA's business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs. The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover its investing and financing activities without issuing additional debt or equity, resulting in negative cash burn,\u201d and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA's negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future. If Brookfield DTLA's operating cash flows and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA's primary liquidity sources and uses during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nSources:\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d ;\n\u2022Proceeds from additional secured debt financings, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Contributions from noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nUses:\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d;\n\u2022Capital expenditures and leasing costs, see Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\u201d;\n\u2022Payments in connection with secured debt, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Distributions to noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCapital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA's properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length and type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $35.5 million in tenant-related commitments, including tenant improvements, tenant inducements and leasing commissions, which are based on executed leases. As of December 31, 2021, $30.0 million of our tenant-related commitments were expected to be paid during 2022, relating mainly to tenant improvement works performed for a major tenant in the Wells Fargo Center-North Tower of $20.4 million.\nBrookfield DTLA expects that capital improvements and leasing activities at its properties will require material amounts of cash for at least several years. According to our 2022 business plan, Brookfield DTLA projects spending approximately $435.5 million over the next five years consisting of $322.5 million for tenant improvements and landlord works, $98.7 million for leasing costs and $14.3 million for capital expenditures.

The original $450.0 million secured loans were replaced with secured loans of $465.0 million, comprised of a $350.0 million mortgage loan, a $65.0 million mezzanine loan and a $50.0 million mezzanine loan, each of which bears interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus 1.89%, 5.00% and 7.75%, respectively. The initial maturity date of these interest-only loans is February 9, 2023. The mortgage loan can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment fees (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until February 2022 after which the loan may be repaid without prepayment fees. A voluntary prepayment of the mortgage or mezzanine loans requires a simultaneous pro-rata prepayment of all loans encumbering this property. Brookfield DTLA has three options to extend the loans maturity dates for a period of one year each, as long as the maturity date of the mezzanine loans is extended simultaneously with the mortgage loan, and no Event of Default (as defined in the underlying loan agreements) has occurred. All proceeds from the new secured loans were used to pay off the original $450.0 million encumbrance and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. The Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million, which represented a prepayment premium and debt yield maintenance fee, in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2021, Brookfield DTLA's debt was comprised of mortgage and mezzanine loans secured by seven properties.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in its cash flows for the periods presented below.\nA summary of changes in Brookfield DTLA's cash flows is as follows:\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Dollar\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,703 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,836) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(58,062) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,226 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,076) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,684) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon (1) the occupancy level of its portfolio, (2) the rental rates achieved on its leases, (3) the collectibility of rent and other amounts billed to tenants, (4) changes in working capital, and (5) interest payments. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to cash inflows from working capital changes by $12.7 million and decreases in interest payments on secured debt by $8.9 million. Working capital changes are subject to variability period over period as a result of timing differences, including with respect to the collection of tenant receivables and payments of accounts and tenant payables. The cash inflows were partially offset by decreases in cash lease revenue by $11.7 million, reflecting the reduction in occupancy.\nInvesting Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from investing activities are generally impacted by the amount of capital expenditures and tenant improvement activities for its properties. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to decreases in capital expenditures by $17.7 million following the completion of the atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center in 2020, and decreases in tenant improvement expenditure by $5.8 million. Furthermore, following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nFinancing Activities\nBrookfield DTLA's cash flows from financing activities are generally impacted by its loan activity, and contributions from and distributions to its equity holders, if any.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by the Gas Company Tower and the issuance of Series B preferred interest of $25.5 million were the main source of cash provided by financing activities. All proceeds from the new secured loans were used to pay off the original $450.0 million encumbrance and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. As Brookfield DTLA had excess cash from operating activities, it repurchased $45.3 million of the Series B preferred interest and made distributions of $17.8 million to the Series B preferred interest.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net proceeds from the refinancing of the loans secured by EY Plaza office property and proceeds from the Series B preferred interest of $47.9 million were the main source of cash provided by financing activities. Cash outflows were mainly driven by repurchases of and distributions to the Series B preferred interest of $34.2 million and $17.9 million, respectively, using the excess cash from the upsized refinancing of the loans secured by 777 Tower and EY Plaza and operating activities generated from other properties.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019\nSee Part II, Item 7.

With the restrictive measures imposed on non-essential businesses and employees working from home, both parking revenue and variable expense decreased accordingly. Although state and local authorities began easing restrictions on businesses in the second quarter of 2021 and the California State fully reopened its economy in June 2021, the physical occupancy of our office properties has remained well below capacity as infection rates fluctuated and most employers continued their COVID-19 response protocols and allowed employees to work from home when possible.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses mainly represent asset management fee, audit and professional fees, and miscellaneous expenses. Decrease in other expenses was mainly due to nonrecurring charges made during the year ended December 31, 2020, including a provision for loan losses related to a construction loan receivable to a Company's affiliate of $2.7 million, a realized loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.8 million, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swap contracts of $1.0 million.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to decline in weighted average LIBOR rates on our variable-rate debt from 0.49% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 0.13% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2019\nSee Part II, Item 7.

Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are defined as accounting estimates or assumptions made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, which involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty or subjectivity and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Our significant accounting policies, which utilize these critical accounting estimates, are described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nImpairment of investments in real estate\nInvestments in long-lived assets, including our investments in real estate, are reviewed for impairment quarterly or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets might not be recoverable, which is referred to as a triggering event\u201d or an impairment indicator.\u201d The carrying amount of long-lived assets to be held and used is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the estimated sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Triggering events or impairment indicators for long-lived assets to be held and used are assessed by property and include significant fluctuations in estimated net operating income, changes in occupancy, significant near-term lease expirations, current and historical operating and/or cash flow losses, rental rates, and other market factors.\nWhen conducting the impairment review of our investments in real estate, we assessed the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon numerous factors that require management to make assumptions and apply judgement. These factors include, but are not limited to, the credit quality of our tenants, available market information, known trends, current market/economic conditions that may affect the asset, and historical and forecasted financial and operating information relating to the property, such as net operating income, occupancy statistics, vacancy projections, renewal percentage, and rent collection rates. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a property are less than its carrying amount, the Company determines the fair value of the property and an impairment loss would be recorded to write down the carrying amount of such property to its fair value. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate aggregated $2.4 billion, or approximately 87% of our total assets. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, management concluded that none of Brookfield DTLA's real estate properties were impaired.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nImpairment of an investment in unconsolidated real estate joint venture\nOur investment in the unconsolidated real estate joint venture, Brookfield DTLA Fund Properties IV LLC, is evaluated for impairment when conditions exist that may indicate that the decrease in the carrying amount of our investment has occurred and is other than temporary. Triggering events or impairment indicators for an unconsolidated real estate joint venture includes its recurring operating losses, and other events such as significant changes in construction costs, estimated completion dates, and other factors related to the development property owned by the real estate joint venture. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate joint venture was $43.2 million, or approximately 2% of our total assets. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no other-than-temporary impairments related to our unconsolidated real estate joint venture were identified.\nRecently Issued Accounting Literature\nPlease refer to Item 8.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto that appear in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties regarding events, conditions, and financial trends that may affect the Company's future plans of operations, business strategy, results of operations, and financial position. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those included within or contemplated by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any responsibility to update any of these factors or to announce publicly any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained in this or any document, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nOverview and Background\nBrookfield DTLA Fund Office Trust Investor Inc. ( Brookfield DTLA\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended, and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A preferred stock\u201d) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, MPG\u201d). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DTLA Holdings\u201d, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the Manager\u201d). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ( BPY\u201d), an exempted limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda, which in turn is the flagship commercial property entity and the primary vehicle through which Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAM\u201d), a corporation under the Laws of Canada, invests in real estate on a global basis. On April 1, 2021, BAM and BPY announced an agreement for BAM to acquire 100% of the limited partnership units of BPY. The acquisition was completed in July 2021 and the acquisition did not have any impact to the Company.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA owns and manages six Class A office properties and a retail center, consisting of 7,580,957 rentable square feet in total. Additionally, Brookfield DTLA also has an indirect noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns a multifamily residential development property. All of these properties are located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the LACBD\u201d) in Downtown Los Angeles, which has long been a major office district for law firms, accounting firms and government agencies. The following table sets forth information regarding these eight properties as of December 31, 2021:\n\n(1) Represents properties' leased square feet over total rentable square feet for executed leases as of December 31, 2021.\n(2) Represents weighted-average of the period remaining (denominated in years) for executed lease as of December 31, 2021, excluding tenant lease extension options.\n(3) Under development as of December 31, 2021.\n(4) Classified as Class A office properties as they are centrally-located buildings that are professionally managed and maintained, attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates, and that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings.\nBrookfield DTLA primarily receives its income from lease income, including tenant reimbursements, generated from the operations of its office and retail properties, and to a lesser extent, revenue from its parking garages.\nCurrent Year Highlights\nCoronavirus ( COVID-19\u201d) Update\nIn December 2020, the U.S. began a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination campaign. On June 15, 2021, as California fully reopened its economy, restrictions such as physical distancing, capacity limits and the county tier system were lifted (the Reopening\u201d). However, since the Reopening, the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants brought uncertainty to the economic recovery and many office tenants revised their return-to-office plans in response to the soaring case counts.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDuring 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic have continued to impact numerous aspects of our business and our properties, which are located in the City of Los Angeles. Some of the effects include the following:\n\u2022Prior to the Reopening, capacity limits were imposed on higher-risk activities and businesses such as indoor dining, bars, fitness centers and movie theaters according to the tier system of the California state's reopening framework. As a result, our retail tenants in FIGat7th experienced the most immediate impact of the restrictions imposed. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, total lease income and parking revenue from FIGat7th represented approximately 5%, 3% and 4%, respectively, of the consolidated total. Due to the uncertainties posed to our tenants in FIGat7th by these restrictions, adjustments of $2.3 million were recognized during 2020, to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable. In contrast, the Company recorded favorable lease income adjustments of $0.5 million during 2021, as a result of the Reopening as various retail tenants benefited from higher visitor traffic.\n\u2022While our office properties have remained open, most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the stay-at-home\u201d order was issued in March 2020. Although state and local authorities lifted restrictions on businesses in June 2021, the physical occupancy of our office properties has remained well below capacity as infection rates fluctuated and most employers continued their COVID-19 response protocols and allowed employees to work from home when possible. As of December 31, 2021, most of our office tenants have been current in paying amounts due to us under their leases. Due to the uncertainties posed to our office property tenants by the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020, adjustments of $6.1 million were recognized to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable. In contrast, the Company recorded favorable lease income adjustments of $0.7 million during 2021, as a result of the Reopening and office employees returning to offices.\n\u2022The Company received certain rent relief requests for certain periods in 2020 and 2021 from many of our retail tenants and some of our office tenants as a result of the measures taken to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our tenants have availed themselves of various federal and state relief funds, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, which can be utilized to partially meet rental obligations. While our tenants are required to fulfill their commitments to us under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to carefully consider temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements on a lease-by-lease basis and only consider those which have a justifiable financial basis.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n\u2022The following table presents parking net operating income during 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\nDecrease in parking net operating income is mainly attributable to the restrictions imposed by state and local authorities that impact the physical occupancy of both our office and retail properties.\n\u2022Decline in property values resulting from lower than anticipated revenues due to reduced increases in forecasted rental rates on new or renewal leases, applied credit losses, lower leasing velocity and increased lease concessions or incentives. While the carrying values of the properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, we estimate the undiscounted cashflows and fair values of the properties as part of our impairment review of investments in real estate. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Significant Accounting Policies-Impairment Review\u201d for further discussion.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the collection percentage as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to the amounts due from our tenants since the onset of the pandemic:\n\n\n(1) Adjusted for rent concessions granted to tenants.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Rents, Deferred Rents and Other Receivables, Net\u201d for a discussion of how we assess the collectibility of amounts due under leases with our tenants.\nIn addition, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that the COVID-19 pandemic directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nWhile we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impact of COVID-19, we expect impacts of COVID-19 to continue affecting our financial results at least through 2022, albeit modestly. The future impact of the pandemic on the demand for office space is unclear, as companies consider the repercussion of the pandemic on their business and their demand for labor while, at the same time, evaluate their space requirements in light of their current and projected headcounts and the continued focus on social distancing and employees' desire for more work-location flexibility.\nLeasing Activity and Occupancy Level\nFollowing the Reopening, leasing activity improved with new and renewal leases totaling 492,367 square feet within our portfolio in 2021, compared to 414,577 square feet in 2020, an increase of 19% year over year. Contractual expirations and early terminations of leases totaled 632,280 square feet in 2021, compared to 707,209 square feet in 2020, a decrease of 11% year over year. Despite the slight improvement in leasing activity, occupancy decreased from 79.1% in 2020 to 77.2% in 2021 due to the negative net absorption. See Leasing Activity\u201d for details.\nFinancing\nIn February 2021, Brookfield DTLA closed a $465.0 million interest-only debt secured by Gas Company Tower. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in February 2026, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95%. All the proceeds from this debt were used to pay off the original $450.0 million debt that previously encumbered the property and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. See \"Indebtedness\" for details.\nCapital Improvements\nThe atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center was completed in 2020 and the construction of the various food vendor spaces is in progress with openings starting in the second quarter of 2021 and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn 2020 and 2021, in response to the measures taken to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. Further, expenditures for tenant improvements has continued to decline as a result of decreased leasing activity in 2020 and 2021. Accordingly, expenditures for real estate improvements decreased by $65.3 million or 83% from $78.5 million in 2020 to $13.2 million in 2021. We anticipate that capital improvement activities will resume gradually starting 2022, as the economy continues to recover.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n755 South Figueroa Development\nThe 755 South Figueroa multifamily site is held by an unconsolidated real estate joint venture in which the Company had an ownership interest of 33.6%. As of December 31, 2021, construction is actively underway with core concrete construction complete through eight levels of parking and thirty eight floors of the superblock. Substantial completion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022 and will accommodate 785 rental units, approximately 5,300 square feet of retail space and 800 parking spaces. As the development progresses towards the targeted completion in 2022, $172.3 million was capitalized as development cost during 2021, compared to $76.4 million during 2020. As such, during 2021, additional capital contributions of $39.8 million, compared to $13.6 million in 2020, were made by DTLA FP IV Holdings to fund development costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nThe following table presents the major sources of Brookfield DTLA's liquidity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\nBrookfield DTLA's business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs. The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover its investing and financing activities without issuing additional debt or equity, resulting in negative cash burn,\u201d and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA's negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future. If Brookfield DTLA's operating cash flows and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA's primary liquidity sources and uses during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nSources:\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d ;\n\u2022Proceeds from additional secured debt financings, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Contributions from noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nUses:\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d;\n\u2022Capital expenditures and leasing costs, see Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\u201d;\n\u2022Payments in connection with secured debt, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Distributions to noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCapital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA's properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length and type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $35.5 million in tenant-related commitments, including tenant improvements, tenant inducements and leasing commissions, which are based on executed leases. As of December 31, 2021, $30.0 million of our tenant-related commitments were expected to be paid during 2022, relating mainly to tenant improvement works performed for a major tenant in the Wells Fargo Center-North Tower of $20.4 million.\nBrookfield DTLA expects that capital improvements and leasing activities at its properties will require material amounts of cash for at least several years. According to our 2022 business plan, Brookfield DTLA projects spending approximately $435.5 million over the next five years consisting of $322.5 million for tenant improvements and landlord works, $98.7 million for leasing costs and $14.3 million for capital expenditures. The expected capital improvements include, but are not limited to, renovations and physical capital upgrades to Brookfield DTLA's properties, elevator modernization, replacement of transformers and boilers, and upgrades to emergency generators. These projections are estimates and may be subject to changes per future revisions of speculative leasing plans.\nSee Indebtedness\u201d below for more information regarding future advance amounts available as of December 31, 2021 under the loans secured by the Wells Fargo Center-South Tower and 777 Tower office properties that can be drawn to fund approved leasing costs, including tenant improvements and inducements and leasing commissions, and, in the case of Wells Fargo Center-South Tower, common area improvements.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nIndebtedness\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, our issuances and repayments of debt included the following:\n\n(1) Maturity dates include the effect of extension options that the Company controls.\nN/A Not applicable since the loans were fully repaid as of December 31, 2021.\nOn February 5, 2021, Brookfield DTLA refinanced its Gas Company Tower secured loans. The original $450.0 million secured loans were replaced with secured loans of $465.0 million, comprised of a $350.0 million mortgage loan, a $65.0 million mezzanine loan and a $50.0 million mezzanine loan, each of which bears interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus 1.89%, 5.00% and 7.75%, respectively. The initial maturity date of these interest-only loans is February 9, 2023. The mortgage loan can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment fees (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until February 2022 after which the loan may be repaid without prepayment fees. A voluntary prepayment of the mortgage or mezzanine loans requires a simultaneous pro-rata prepayment of all loans encumbering this property. Brookfield DTLA has three options to extend the loans maturity dates for a period of one year each, as long as the maturity date of the mezzanine loans is extended simultaneously with the mortgage loan, and no Event of Default (as defined in the underlying loan agreements) has occurred. All proceeds from the new secured loans were used to pay off the original $450.0 million encumbrance and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. The Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million, which represented a prepayment premium and debt yield maintenance fee, in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2021, Brookfield DTLA's debt was comprised of mortgage and mezzanine loans secured by seven properties.

( Brookfield DTLA\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a Maryland corporation and was incorporated on April 19, 2013. Brookfield DTLA was formed for the purpose of consummating the transactions contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of April 24, 2013, as amended, and the issuance of shares of 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the Series A preferred stock\u201d) in connection with the acquisition of MPG Office Trust, Inc. and MPG Office, L.P. (together, MPG\u201d). Brookfield DTLA is a direct subsidiary of Brookfield DTLA Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( DTLA Holdings\u201d, and together with its affiliates excluding the Company and its subsidiaries, the Manager\u201d). DTLA Holdings is an indirect partially-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Property Partners L.P. ( BPY\u201d), an exempted limited partnership under the Laws of Bermuda, which in turn is the flagship commercial property entity and the primary vehicle through which Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAM\u201d), a corporation under the Laws of Canada, invests in real estate on a global basis. On April 1, 2021, BAM and BPY announced an agreement for BAM to acquire 100% of the limited partnership units of BPY. The acquisition was completed in July 2021 and the acquisition did not have any impact to the Company.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA owns and manages six Class A office properties and a retail center, consisting of 7,580,957 rentable square feet in total. Additionally, Brookfield DTLA also has an indirect noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that owns a multifamily residential development property. All of these properties are located in the Los Angeles Central Business District (the LACBD\u201d) in Downtown Los Angeles, which has long been a major office district for law firms, accounting firms and government agencies.

On June 15, 2021, as California fully reopened its economy, restrictions such as physical distancing, capacity limits and the county tier system were lifted (the Reopening\u201d). However, since the Reopening, the spread of the Delta and Omicron variants brought uncertainty to the economic recovery and many office tenants revised their return-to-office plans in response to the soaring case counts.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nDuring 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to combat the spread of the pandemic have continued to impact numerous aspects of our business and our properties, which are located in the City of Los Angeles. Some of the effects include the following:\n\u2022Prior to the Reopening, capacity limits were imposed on higher-risk activities and businesses such as indoor dining, bars, fitness centers and movie theaters according to the tier system of the California state's reopening framework. As a result, our retail tenants in FIGat7th experienced the most immediate impact of the restrictions imposed. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, total lease income and parking revenue from FIGat7th represented approximately 5%, 3% and 4%, respectively, of the consolidated total. Due to the uncertainties posed to our tenants in FIGat7th by these restrictions, adjustments of $2.3 million were recognized during 2020, to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable. In contrast, the Company recorded favorable lease income adjustments of $0.5 million during 2021, as a result of the Reopening as various retail tenants benefited from higher visitor traffic.\n\u2022While our office properties have remained open, most of our office tenants have been working remotely since the stay-at-home\u201d order was issued in March 2020. Although state and local authorities lifted restrictions on businesses in June 2021, the physical occupancy of our office properties has remained well below capacity as infection rates fluctuated and most employers continued their COVID-19 response protocols and allowed employees to work from home when possible. As of December 31, 2021, most of our office tenants have been current in paying amounts due to us under their leases. Due to the uncertainties posed to our office property tenants by the COVID-19 pandemic, during 2020, adjustments of $6.1 million were recognized to lower our lease income related to certain leases where we determined that the collection of future lease payments was not probable. In contrast, the Company recorded favorable lease income adjustments of $0.7 million during 2021, as a result of the Reopening and office employees returning to offices.\n\u2022The Company received certain rent relief requests for certain periods in 2020 and 2021 from many of our retail tenants and some of our office tenants as a result of the measures taken to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our tenants have availed themselves of various federal and state relief funds, such as the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program, which can be utilized to partially meet rental obligations. While our tenants are required to fulfill their commitments to us under their leases, we have implemented and will continue to carefully consider temporary rent deferrals and rent abatements on a lease-by-lease basis and only consider those which have a justifiable financial basis.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n\u2022The following table presents parking net operating income during 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020\n% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019\n% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(30) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking expense </td> <td>(8,570) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,648) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,373) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Parking net operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecrease in parking net operating income is mainly attributable to the restrictions imposed by state and local authorities that impact the physical occupancy of both our office and retail properties.\n\u2022Decline in property values resulting from lower than anticipated revenues due to reduced increases in forecasted rental rates on new or renewal leases, applied credit losses, lower leasing velocity and increased lease concessions or incentives.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-Note 2-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Rents, Deferred Rents and Other Receivables, Net\u201d for a discussion of how we assess the collectibility of amounts due under leases with our tenants.\nIn addition, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a discussion about risks that the COVID-19 pandemic directly or indirectly may pose to our business.\nWhile we cannot be certain as to the duration of the impact of COVID-19, we expect impacts of COVID-19 to continue affecting our financial results at least through 2022, albeit modestly. The future impact of the pandemic on the demand for office space is unclear, as companies consider the repercussion of the pandemic on their business and their demand for labor while, at the same time, evaluate their space requirements in light of their current and projected headcounts and the continued focus on social distancing and employees' desire for more work-location flexibility.\nLeasing Activity and Occupancy Level\nFollowing the Reopening, leasing activity improved with new and renewal leases totaling 492,367 square feet within our portfolio in 2021, compared to 414,577 square feet in 2020, an increase of 19% year over year. Contractual expirations and early terminations of leases totaled 632,280 square feet in 2021, compared to 707,209 square feet in 2020, a decrease of 11% year over year. Despite the slight improvement in leasing activity, occupancy decreased from 79.1% in 2020 to 77.2% in 2021 due to the negative net absorption. See Leasing Activity\u201d for details.\nFinancing\nIn February 2021, Brookfield DTLA closed a $465.0 million interest-only debt secured by Gas Company Tower. This debt, which is scheduled to mature in February 2026, bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.95%. All the proceeds from this debt were used to pay off the original $450.0 million debt that previously encumbered the property and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. See \"Indebtedness\" for details.\nCapital Improvements\nThe atrium development project at Wells Fargo Center was completed in 2020 and the construction of the various food vendor spaces is in progress with openings starting in the second quarter of 2021 and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.\nIn 2020 and 2021, in response to the measures taken to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, Brookfield DTLA strategically deferred and cancelled various capital expenditure projects of lower priority. Further, expenditures for tenant improvements has continued to decline as a result of decreased leasing activity in 2020 and 2021. Accordingly, expenditures for real estate improvements decreased by $65.3 million or 83% from $78.5 million in 2020 to $13.2 million in 2021. We anticipate that capital improvement activities will resume gradually starting 2022, as the economy continues to recover.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\n755 South Figueroa Development\nThe 755 South Figueroa multifamily site is held by an unconsolidated real estate joint venture in which the Company had an ownership interest of 33.6%. As of December 31, 2021, construction is actively underway with core concrete construction complete through eight levels of parking and thirty eight floors of the superblock. Substantial completion is expected in the fourth quarter of 2022 and will accommodate 785 rental units, approximately 5,300 square feet of retail space and 800 parking spaces. As the development progresses towards the targeted completion in 2022, $172.3 million was capitalized as development cost during 2021, compared to $76.4 million during 2020. As such, during 2021, additional capital contributions of $39.8 million, compared to $13.6 million in 2020, were made by DTLA FP IV Holdings to fund development costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nThe following table presents the major sources of Brookfield DTLA's liquidity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,394 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused capital contribution commitments available on Series B preferred interest </td> <td>21,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,678 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Availability under secured debt to fund approved leasing costs\n</td> <td>72,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,804 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>132,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>156,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBrookfield DTLA's business requires continued access to adequate cash to fund its liquidity needs. The amount of cash Brookfield DTLA currently generates from its operations is not sufficient to cover its investing and financing activities without issuing additional debt or equity, resulting in negative cash burn,\u201d and there can be no assurance that the amount of Brookfield DTLA's negative cash burn will decrease, or that it will not increase, in the future. If Brookfield DTLA's operating cash flows and capital are not sufficient to cover its operating costs or to repay its indebtedness as it comes due, we may issue additional debt and/or equity, including to affiliates of Brookfield DTLA, which issuances could further adversely impact the amount of funds available to Brookfield DTLA for any purpose, including for dividends or other distributions to holders of its capital stock, including the Series A preferred stock. In many cases, such securities may be issued if authorized by the board of directors of Brookfield DTLA without the approval of holders of the Series A preferred stock.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nBrookfield DTLA's primary liquidity sources and uses during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nSources:\n\u2022Cash provided by operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d ;\n\u2022Proceeds from additional secured debt financings, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Contributions from noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nUses:\n\u2022Cash used in operating activities, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Operating Activities\u201d;\n\u2022Capital expenditures and leasing costs, see Capital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\u201d;\n\u2022Payments in connection with secured debt, see Indebtedness\u201d; and\n\u2022Distributions to noncontrolling interests, see Discussion of Consolidated Cash Flows - Financing Activities\u201d.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nCapital Expenditures and Leasing Costs\nCapital expenditures fluctuate in any given period, subject to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required to maintain Brookfield DTLA's properties. Leasing costs also fluctuate in any given period, depending upon such factors as the type of property, the length and type of lease, the involvement of external leasing agents and overall market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $35.5 million in tenant-related commitments, including tenant improvements, tenant inducements and leasing commissions, which are based on executed leases. As of December 31, 2021, $30.0 million of our tenant-related commitments were expected to be paid during 2022, relating mainly to tenant improvement works performed for a major tenant in the Wells Fargo Center-North Tower of $20.4 million.\nBrookfield DTLA expects that capital improvements and leasing activities at its properties will require material amounts of cash for at least several years.

The original $450.0 million secured loans were replaced with secured loans of $465.0 million, comprised of a $350.0 million mortgage loan, a $65.0 million mezzanine loan and a $50.0 million mezzanine loan, each of which bears interest at variable rates equal to LIBOR plus 1.89%, 5.00% and 7.75%, respectively. The initial maturity date of these interest-only loans is February 9, 2023. The mortgage loan can be prepaid, in whole or in part, with prepayment fees (as defined in the underlying loan agreement) until February 2022 after which the loan may be repaid without prepayment fees. A voluntary prepayment of the mortgage or mezzanine loans requires a simultaneous pro-rata prepayment of all loans encumbering this property. Brookfield DTLA has three options to extend the loans maturity dates for a period of one year each, as long as the maturity date of the mezzanine loans is extended simultaneously with the mortgage loan, and no Event of Default (as defined in the underlying loan agreements) has occurred. All proceeds from the new secured loans were used to pay off the original $450.0 million encumbrance and to satisfy the new loans' required reserves. The Company recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4.6 million, which represented a prepayment premium and debt yield maintenance fee, in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBROOKFIELD DTLA FUND OFFICE TRUST INVESTOR INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nAs of December 31, 2021, Brookfield DTLA's debt was comprised of mortgage and mezzanine loans secured by seven properties.
