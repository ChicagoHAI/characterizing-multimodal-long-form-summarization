This preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if (i) the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (ii) different estimates and assumptions were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the application of our policies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are presented below.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts and Notes Receivable\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment. If we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms, the revenue is considered unearned\u201d and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nShipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Taxes collected on sales to customers are excluded from revenues.\nThe following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of the Company's reportable segments:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe derive the substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations. We periodically review the assumptions underlying estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly.\nRevenue in Purification Solutions is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. For major activated carbon injection systems projects, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\nRevenue in Specialty Fluids arises primarily from the rental of cesium formate. This revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms. Customers are also billed and revenue is recognized, typically at the end of the job, for cesium formate product that is not returned. We also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of a rental process and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the fluid.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis. Customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. There are no material changes in the allowance for any of the years presented. There is no material off-balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances.\nInventory Valuation\nThe cost of all carbon black inventories in the U.S. is determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method. Total U.S. inventories utilizing this cost flow assumption were $28 million and $24 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These inventories represent 8% and 6% of total worldwide inventories at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Had we used the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method instead of the LIFO method for such inventories, the value of those inventories would have been $27 million and $30 million higher as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cost of Specialty Fluids inventories, which are classified as assets held for rent, is determined using the average cost method. The cost of other U.S. and all non-U.S. inventories is determined using the FIFO method. In periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs, the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability. Under our current LIFO method, when raw material costs are rising, our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to Cost of sales. If, however, we were using a FIFO method, our purchases from earlier periods, which were at lower prices, would instead be the first charged to Cost of sales. The opposite result could occur during a period of rapid decline in raw material costs.\nAt certain times, we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the LIFO method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated. The inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs. If there is a liquidation of an inventory layer, there may be an impact to our Cost of sales and Net income for that period. If the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost, there would be a reduction in our Cost of sales and an increase to our Net income during the period. Conversely, if the liquidated inventory is at a cost higher than our current cost, there will be an increase in our Cost of sales and a reduction to our net income during the period.\nWe review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices periodically. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. Historically, such write-downs have not been material. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of May 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is at or below the operating segment level, and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The separate businesses included within Performance Chemicals are considered separate reporting units. The goodwill balance relative to this segment is recorded in the Metal Oxides reporting unit.\nFor the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an additional quantitative evaluation is performed under the two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform an analysis of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined to be less than its carrying amount, an impairment is recognized for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The fair value is also benchmarked against a market approach using the guideline public companies method. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's best estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. Should the fair value of any of our reporting units decline below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary.\nWhen we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and we recorded impairment charges as a result. A discussion of this assessment and the charges recorded is included under Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\nBased on our most recent annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2016, the fair values of the Reinforcement Materials and Fumed Metal Oxides reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 9% at that time. The fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit includes certain growth assumptions that are primarily dependent on: (1) further growth in the mercury removal related portion of the business, which is largely dependent on the amount of coal-based power generation used in the United States and the continued regulation of those utilities under MATS and (2) growth in demand for our activated carbon products in other applications, while meeting our margin expectations. Realizing these assumptions is generally driven by the macroeconomic environment, environmental regulations, and global and regional competition.\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the valuation model. We estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are comprised of trademarks, customer relationships and developed technologies, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. We recognized an impairment on intangible assets associated with the Purification Solutions business in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and no events have been subsequently identified that would require an additional impairment evaluation.\nLong-lived Assets Impairment\nOur long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments and assets held for rent. The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nTo test for impairment of assets we generally use a probability-weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable.\nAn asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the analysis described above, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. If the asset does not have a readily determinable market value, a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset. In circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset.\nPurification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\nDuring fiscal 2015 and as a result of the impairment tests performed on goodwill and long-lived assets of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we recorded impairment charges and an associated tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn determining the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we used an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporated significant estimates and assumptions related to future periods, including the timing of the MATS implementation, the anticipated size of the mercury removal industry, and growth rates and pricing assumptions of activated carbon, among others. In addition, an estimate of the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present value. The WACC was based upon externally available data considering market participants' cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to the Purification Solutions reporting unit. Based on these estimates and as part of step one of the annual impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was lower than the reporting unit's carrying value. As such, the reporting unit failed step one of the goodwill impairment test. We then proceeded to step two.\nStep two of the goodwill impairment test requires us to perform a theoretical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill. The estimate of fair value is complex and requires significant judgment. Accounting guidance provides that we should recognize an estimated impairment charge to the extent that it determines that it is probable that an impairment loss has occurred and such impairment can be reasonably estimated. Based on our best estimate as of June 30, 2015, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $353 million. We completed the step two analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which resulted in recording a credit of $1 million to the pre-tax goodwill impairment charge.\nBased on the same factors leading to the goodwill impairment, we also considered whether the reporting unit's carrying values of definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are the trademarks of Purification Solutions, and determined that the fair value of these intangible assets was lower than their carrying value. As such, an impairment loss was recorded in the amount of $39 million. Subsequent to this impairment analysis, we concluded that such assets no longer had an indefinite life and began amortizing these assets over their estimated useful life. We also performed an impairment analysis to assess if definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the reporting unit, and determined that these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over their remaining useful lives. Accordingly, an impairment charge was recorded based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the long-lived assets. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets and a combination of the cost and market approaches to fair value our property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment charges of $119 million and $51 million, to our definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. We completed the impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 which resulted in increasing the property, plant and equipment impairment charge by $1 million to $52 million. Therefore, for the year ended September 30, 2015, the long-lived assets impairment charge was $210 million. In connection with the long-lived assets impairment charges, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $80 million to our income tax provision.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees. Plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions. The assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans, are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans (where applicable) and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. The most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets. Assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied; they include estimated discount rates, rates of compensation increases for employees, and mortality, employee turnover and other related demographic data. Projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. However, cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nWe are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and environmental litigation. After consultation with counsel, as appropriate, we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range. Our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information, including claims, settlement offers, demands by government agencies, estimates performed by independent third parties, identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute, and our prior experience. Litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims. The amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites, the nature of the remedies, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. These liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information, changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations, which could result in higher or lower costs.\nOur current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time. Developments that could affect our estimate include, but are not limited to, (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending claims, (iii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iv) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (v) changes in the nature of claims received, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) the financial viability of other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, (viii) a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by certain of the other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, or the indemnity provided by a former owner of the business, (ix) changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and (x) a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable. We cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims. Accordingly, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The depreciable lives for buildings, machinery and equipment, and other fixed assets are twenty to twenty-five years, ten to twenty-five years, and three to twenty-five years, respectively. The cost and accumulated depreciation for property, plant and equipment sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and resulting gains or losses are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which significantly extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.\nIncome Taxes\nOur business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries. We file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction's tax laws.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow.\nWe record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This analysis presumes the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts, but does not consider the time value of money. We also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdditionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry-forwards, foreign tax credits, and other income tax credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time. We review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis. Failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets. An increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nWe have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in Note A of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Certain of these policies include the use of estimates, but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure. However, these policies are important to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nCabot is organized into four reportable business segments: Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, Purification Solutions, and Specialty Fluids. Cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. The discussions of our results of operations for the periods presented reflect these structures.\nOur analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Unless a calendar year is specified, all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended September 30.\nDefinition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen discussing our results of operations, we use several terms as described below.\nThe term product mix\u201d refers to the mix of types and grades of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold, and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business and/or segment.\nThe term LIFO\u201d includes two factors: (i) the impact of current inventory costs being recognized immediately in Cost of sales under a last-in first-out method, compared to the older costs that would have been included in Cost of sales under a first-in first-out method ( Cost of sales impact\u201d); and (ii) the impact of reductions in inventory quantities, causing historical inventory costs to flow through Cost of sales ( liquidation impact\u201d).\nOur discussion under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d includes a discussion of our effective tax rate\u201d and our operating tax rate\u201d and includes a reconciliation of the two rates. Our operating tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In calculating our operating tax rate, we exclude discrete tax items, which include: i) unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release or establishment of a valuation allowance, ii) items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements, interest on tax reserves, and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations, and iii) other discrete tax items, such as the tax impact of legislative changes and, on a quarterly basis, the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment, if applicable. We also exclude the tax impact of certain items, as defined below in the discussion of Total segment EBIT, on both operating income and the tax provision. Our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nOur discussion under the heading Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014-By Business Segment\u201d includes a discussion of Total segment EBIT, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses segment EBIT to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments. We believe Total segment EBIT, which reflects the sum of EBIT from our four reportable segments, provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance, allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management, and provides context for our discussion of individual business segment performance. Total segment EBIT should not be considered an alternative for Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Total segment EBIT to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided in Note U of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Investors should consider the limitations associated with this non-GAAP measure, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another.\nIn calculating Total segment EBIT, we exclude from our Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies (i) items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of our fundamental on-going segment results, which we refer to as certain items\u201d, and (ii) items that, because they are not controlled by the business segments and primarily benefit corporate objectives, are not allocated to our business segments, such as interest expense and other corporate costs, which include unallocated corporate overhead expenses such as certain corporate salaries and headquarter expenses, plus costs related to special projects and initiatives, which we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d. Management believes excluding the items identified as certain items facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense and income items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis and also facilitates an evaluation of the Company's operating performance without the impact of these costs or benefits. The calculations of Total segment EBIT for the periods presented exclude the impact of the following items that are included in our GAAP Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Global restructuring activities include costs or benefits associated with cost reduction initiatives or plant closures and are primarily related to (i) employee termination costs, (ii) asset impairment charges associated with restructuring actions, (iii) costs to close facilities, including environmental costs and contract termination penalties and (iv) gains realized on the sale of land or equipment associated with restructured plants or locations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Foreign currency loss on devaluation represents the impact of government controlled currency devaluations on the Company's net monetary assets denominated in that currency.

In Reinforcement Materials, longer term demand is driven primarily by: i) the number of vehicle miles driven globally; ii) the number of original equipment and replacement tires produced; and iii) the number of automotive builds. Over the past several years, operating results have been driven by a number of factors, including: i) increases or decreases in our sales volumes driven by changes in production levels for tires or industrial rubber products and the level at which we service that demand; ii) changes in raw material costs and our ability to adjust the sales price for our products commensurate with changes in raw material costs; iii) changes in pricing and product mix dependent on the level of price increases or decreases to customers as well as the mix of products sold or the region in which they are sold; iv) global and regional capacity utilization for carbon black; v) fixed cost savings achieved through restructuring and other cost saving activities; vi) the growth of our volumes and market position in emerging economies; vii) capacity management and technology investments, including the impact of energy utilization and yield improvement technologies at our manufacturing facilities; and viii) royalties and technology payments related to our patented elastomer composites technology that is used in tire applications.\nIn Performance Chemicals, longer term demand is driven primarily by the construction and infrastructure, automotive, electronics and consumer products industries. In recent years, operating results in Performance Chemicals have been driven by: i) increases or decreases in sales volumes to the industries previously noted; ii) our ability to deliver differentiated products that drive enhanced performance in customers' applications; iii) our ability to obtain value pricing for this differentiation; iv) the cost of new capacity; and v) the adoption of new products for use in our customers' applications.\nIn Purification Solutions, longer term demand is driven primarily by the demand for activated carbon based solutions for water, gas and air, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, catalysts and other chemical applications. Operating results in Purification Solutions have been influenced by: i) changes in our sales volumes in the various applications previously noted; ii) the amount of coal-based power generation utilized in the U.S. and the regulation of those utilities; iii) management of our operations, including inventory levels, and the commensurate costs; iv) changes in price and product mix; and v) industry capacity utilization.\nIn Specialty Fluids, demand for cesium formate is primarily driven by the level of drilling activity for high pressure oil and gas wells and by the petroleum industry's acceptance of our product as a drilling and completion fluid for this application. Operating results in Specialty Fluids are influenced by the number of drilling projects as well as the size, type and duration of the drilling jobs within the business.\nOverview of Results for Fiscal 2016\nDuring fiscal 2016, Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies increased compared to fiscal 2015 largely due to the goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges related to the Purification Solutions segment that we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. In addition, our results for fiscal 2016 as compared with results for fiscal 2015 reflect strong EBIT in the Performance Chemicals segment and the benefit from restructuring actions taken to reduce fixed costs across the Company.\nFiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014-Consolidated\nNet Sales and other operating revenue and Gross Profit\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales and other operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,411\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $460 million decrease in net sales from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was due primarily to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $398 million) and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($63 million). The less favorable price and product mix impact was primarily due to lower selling prices during the year from price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw materials costs. The $776 million decrease in net sales from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was due primarily to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $433 million), an unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation ($203 million), a decrease in volumes ($116 million), lower elastomer composites royalties and technology payments ($10 million), and lower royalties in Purification Solutions ($3 million). The less favorable price and product mix impact was primarily due to lower selling prices during the year from price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw materials costs.\nGross profit decreased by $7 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 driven by lower unit margins in Reinforcement Materials and Purification Solutions partially offset by fixed cost savings. Gross profit decreased by $136 million in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 driven by lower margins in Reinforcement Materials and lower volumes in Specialty Fluids.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and administrative expenses decreased by $7 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015.The decrease was principally driven by restructuring actions taken to reduce fixed costs across the Company partially offset by an increase in the reserve for respirator liability matters and higher incentive compensation expense. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $44 million in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was principally driven by reduced spending on travel and corporate projects, lower incentive compensation expense, and lower expenses related to a 2014 restructuring in our Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA\u201d) business service center.\nResearch and Technical Expenses\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and technical expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and technical expenses decreased by $5 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to restructuring actions taken to reduce fixed costs across the Company partially offset by $5 million of costs associated with these actions.

The operating tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 24%. The decrease in the operating tax rate from fiscal 2015 was largely driven by a change in the geographic mix of earnings.\nThe benefit for income taxes was $45 million for fiscal 2015, resulting in an effective tax rate of 12% (refer to the effective tax rate reconciliation in Note S of our Consolidated Financial Statements). This amount included net tax benefits of $107 million, principally comprised of an $80 million benefit from the impairment of the Purification Solutions segment, $14 million of benefits from other certain items and $13 million of benefits from discrete tax items. Refer to Note G of our Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the impairment. The operating tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 26%.\nThe provision for income taxes was $92 million for fiscal 2014, resulting in an effective tax rate of 30% (refer to the effective tax rate reconciliation in Note S of our Consolidated Financial Statements). This amount included net discrete charges of $17 million, principally comprised of a $20 million valuation allowance, partially offset by a non-taxable gain of $29 million recognized on the Company's pre-existing investment in NHUMO as a result of the NHUMO transaction.

The decrease was driven by lower volumes ($69 million), lower unit margins ($44 million), an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency movements ($20 million), lower elastomer composites royalties and technology payments ($10 million), lower Purification Solutions royalties ($3 million) and the absence of a one-time insurance recovery in fiscal 2014 that did not repeat in fiscal 2015 in Purification Solutions ($9 million).

Acquisition and integration-related charges include legal and professional fees, the incremental value of inventory as a result of purchase accounting adjustments and other expenses related to the completion of the acquisitions and the integrations of Purification Solutions and NHUMO. Tax-related certain items include discrete tax items, the nature of which are discussed under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d, and the tax impact of certain foreign exchange losses.\nThe tax impact of certain items is determined by (1) starting with the current and deferred income tax expense or benefit, included in Net income attributable to Cabot Corporation, and (2) subtracting the tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings\u201d.\nAdjusted earnings is defined as the pre-tax income attributable to Cabot Corporation excluding certain items. The tax expense or benefit on adjusted earnings is calculated by applying the operating tax rate, as defined under the section Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures, to adjusted earnings.\nOther Unallocated Items:\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (54\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (53\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (55\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity in earnings of affiliated companies, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unallocated corporate costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General unallocated income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other unallocated items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (92\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (111\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA discussion of items that we refer to as other unallocated items\u201d can be found under the heading Definition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d.

The balances of General unallocated income (expense) consists of gains (losses) arising from foreign currency transactions, net of other foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of accounting for certain inventory on a LIFO basis, the profit or loss related to the corporate adjustment for unearned revenue, and the impact of including the full operating results of an equity affiliate in Purification Solutions Segment EBIT.\nIn fiscal 2016, costs from Total other unallocated items increased by $3 million when compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily driven by a change of $4 million in General unallocated income (expense) due to the cost of sales impact of LIFO accounting from changes in carbon black raw material costs that resulted in an unfavorable comparison ($19 million), partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency movements ($13 million).\nIn fiscal 2015, costs from Total other unallocated items decreased by $19 million when compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was driven by a change of $13 million of General unallocated income (expense) due to the cost of sales impact of LIFO accounting from changes in carbon black raw material costs that resulted in a favorable comparison ($19 million) partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency movements ($6 million). In addition, Unallocated corporate costs decreased by $8 million primarily associated with lower spending for corporate projects and lower expenses related to incentive compensation.\nReinforcement Materials\nSales and EBIT for Reinforcement Materials for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, sales in Reinforcement Materials decreased by $399 million when compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease was principally driven by less favorable price and product mix (combined $335 million), 2% lower volumes ($27 million), and an unfavorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($37 million). The less favorable price and product mix was primarily due to lower selling prices from price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw material costs. Lower volumes were driven by lower demand in South America and Asia due to a challenging macro-economic environment and the closure of our Merak, Indonesia manufacturing plant.\nIn fiscal 2015, sales in Reinforcement Materials decreased by $601 million when compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was principally driven by a less favorable price and product mix (combined $418 million), an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($116 million), 2% lower volumes ($55 million), and lower elastomer composites royalties and technology payments ($10 million). The less favorable price and product mix was primarily due to price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw material costs, lower pricing, and a shift in regional mix from North America to Asia. Lower volumes were driven by a reduction in rubber blacks volumes from lower contractual volumes in North America and weaker demand in China and South America. The lower elastomer composites royalties and technology payments were due to the transition from a fixed to a variable royalty arrangement and lower technology milestone payments.\nIn fiscal 2016, Reinforcement Materials EBIT decreased by $6 million when compared to fiscal 2015 driven principally by lower unit margins ($23 million) and lower volumes ($10 million). The decrease was partially offset by lower fixed costs ($19 million) and a\nfavorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($9 million). Lower unit margins were driven primarily by lower year over year contract pricing in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, increased competition in Asia, unfavorable feedstock-related effects, and lower benefits generated from our energy efficiency investments as a result of lower energy prices. The favorable foreign currency impact was mainly due to the translation of our local currency fixed costs in South America to U.S. dollars. Lower fixed costs were due to cost reductions as a result of restructuring actions and reduced maintenance costs.\nIn fiscal 2015, Reinforcement Materials EBIT decreased by $116 million when compared to fiscal 2014 driven principally by lower rubber blacks unit margins ($91 million), lower rubber blacks volumes ($14 million), lower elastomer composites royalties and technology payments ($10 million), and an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($7 million). The decreases were partially offset by lower rubber blacks fixed costs ($9 million). The less favorable rubber blacks unit margins were due to lower contract pricing and increased competition in Asia, negative feedstock effects from lower raw materials purchasing savings, lower benefits from our energy efficiency investments, and the impact of high cost inventory that moved through our supply chain during the first half of the year. We also experienced a less favorable sales mix, with lower sales in North America and higher sales in Asia. Lower rubber blacks fixed costs were primarily associated with cost management efforts and lower discretionary spending.\nPerformance Chemicals\nSales and EBIT for Performance Chemicals for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Carbons and Formulations Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metal Oxides Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, sales in Performance Chemicals decreased by $62 million when compared to fiscal 2015 due to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $51 million) and the unfavorable comparison from foreign currency translation ($21 million) partially offset by higher volumes ($10 million). The change in price and product mix was mainly driven by price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw material costs.\nIn fiscal 2015, sales in Performance Chemicals decreased by $95 million when compared to fiscal 2014 due to an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($64 million), and a less favorable price and product mix (combined $32 million). The change in price and product mix was mainly driven by price adjustments to customers for decreases in raw material costs.\nIn fiscal 2016, EBIT in Performance Chemicals was $47 million higher when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher unit margins ($34 million) and lower fixed costs ($22 million), partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing inventory levels ($6 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($2 million). Unit margins improved primarily due to lower raw material costs. Lower fixed costs were primarily due to cost reductions as a result of restructuring actions taken earlier in the fiscal year.\nIn fiscal 2015, EBIT in Performance Chemicals was $10 million higher when compared to fiscal 2014 due to higher unit margins ($20 million) and lower fixed costs ($8 million). The improvement in unit margins was driven by lower raw material costs. Lower fixed costs were a result of cost management efforts across the segment. These benefits were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($16 million) and slightly lower volumes ($2 million). Volumes were relatively flat across the segment during fiscal 2015.\nPurification Solutions\nSales and EBIT for Purification Solutions for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in Purification Solutions decreased by $6 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a less favorable price and product mix (combined $10 million) and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation ($6 million), partially offset by an increase in volumes ($10 million). The less favorable price and product mix was due to competitive factors in certain gas and air and water applications as well as increased demand for lower priced products. Higher volumes were driven by higher demand for activated carbon in gas and air applications as the MATS regulation took full effect in April 2016.\nSales in Purification Solutions decreased by $19 million in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 due to an unfavorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($23 million), lower royalties ($3 million) and lower volumes ($3 million), partially offset by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $10 million). The more favorable price and product mix was primarily due to the implementation of price increases and an improved product mix. These price increases contributed to a decline in overall sales volumes; however, volumes sold to mercury removal customers increased due to the first wave of customers complying with the MATS regulation in April 2015.\nEBIT in Purification Solutions decreased by $10 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 driven by the unfavorable impact from reducing inventory levels ($29 million) and lower unit margins ($12 million) due to a less favorable price and product mix and higher raw material costs, partially offset by lower fixed costs due to cost reduction efforts ($19 million), higher volumes ($9 million), and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange ($3 million).\nEBIT in Purification Solutions increased by $24 million in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 driven by improved unit margins ($21 million), lower fixed costs ($14 million), and the favorable comparison of foreign currency translation ($2 million). These improvements were partially offset by lower royalties ($3 million) and the absence of a one-time insurance recovery in fiscal 2014 that did not repeat in fiscal 2015 ($9 million), and lower volumes ($2 million). Higher unit margins were due to the implementation of price increases, improvement in the product mix and lower variable costs. Lower fixed costs were a result of improved operational performance, cost management efforts and $5 million of lower depreciation and amortization.\nSpecialty Fluids\nSales and EBIT for Specialty Fluids for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids EBIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales in Specialty Fluids increased by $5 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes ($5 million). The increase in volumes was driven by a higher level of project activity that resulted in higher rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids in both the North Sea and Asia.\nSales in Specialty Fluids decreased by $56 million in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($62 million) from lower project activity levels that resulted in lower rental and sales volumes for our drilling fluids. The lower level of project activity was caused by the downturn in the oil and gas industry, which resulted in fewer investments, project delays, and stringent cost management by our customers. The decrease in volumes was partially offset by a more favorable price and product mix (combined $6 million).\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids increased by $7 million in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015. The increase is primarily due to higher volumes ($4 million) and lower fixed costs ($4 million) partially offset by a less favorable price and product mix ($1 million).\nEBIT in Specialty Fluids decreased by $33 million in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes ($46 million). In response, we improved our price and product mix ($5 million) and reduced fixed costs ($8 million) to help partially offset the lower volumes.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead to fiscal 2017, we remain focused on driving our advancing the core strategy across all of our segments. The outlook for Reinforcement Materials is mixed. We are experiencing continued strong demand in Europe and a strengthening environment in China. In North America, the long-term fundamentals for tire growth remain solid, however, the near term market is soft due to high levels of truck tire inventories in the supply chain. The South American market remains weak; however, we are beginning to see some signs of recovery in calendar year 2017. After a third record year of EBIT in the Performance Chemicals segment, we expect earnings growth in 2017 to moderate. Although volumes in fumed silica are expected to moderate, the long term fundamentals of the segment remain solid as we continue to invest for future growth. In the Purification Solutions segment, we anticipate solid performance based on the continued strong growth in the MATS related business combined with the elimination of the negative impact associated with decreased inventory levels. For the Specialty Fluids segment, we continue to pursue opportunities outside of the North Sea with a number of projects in the pipeline that support our outlook of continued solid performance in 2017. Overall, we remain confident that our strategy will deliver top-line growth consistent with our end-market participation. In addition, we will continue to invest in new product and process technology, seek to capture the operating leverage from improving plant utilizations, and pursue growth investments, including bolt-on acquisition opportunities in our existing businesses.\nCash Flows and Liquidity\nOverview\nOur liquidity position, as measured by cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing availability, increased by $384 million during fiscal 2016. The increase was largely attributable to an increase in borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, an increase in our cash balances and a reduction in outstanding commercial paper. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $200 million and borrowing availability under our revolving credit agreement of $1 billion. Borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, which was amended in October 2015 to increase the borrowing limit from $750 million to $1 billion, may be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. There was no outstanding balance of commercial paper as of September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our revolving credit facility including the total consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) covenant.\nWe generally manage our cash and debt on a global basis to provide for working capital requirements as needed by region or site. Cash and debt are generally denominated in the local currency of the subsidiary holding the assets or liabilities, except where there are operational cash flow reasons to hold non-functional currency or debt. The vast majority of our cash and cash equivalent holdings tend to be held outside the U.S., as excess cash balances in the U.S. are generally used to repay commercial paper.\nWe anticipate sufficient liquidity from (i) cash on hand; (ii) cash flows from operating activities; and (iii) cash available from our revolving credit agreement and our commercial paper program to meet our operational and capital investment needs and financial obligations for the foreseeable future. Our liquidity derived from cash flows from operations is, to a large degree, predicated on our ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner, the cost of our raw materials, and our ability to manage inventory levels.\nOn September 27, 2016, we redeemed $300 million of 5% fixed rate debt that was issued in fiscal 2009 and had a maturity date of October 1, 2016. In September 2016, Cabot issued $250 million in registered notes with a coupon of 3.4% that mature on September 15, 2026. The net proceeds of this offering were $248 million after deducting discounts and issuance costs.\nOur Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows have been presented to include discontinued operations with continuing operations. Therefore, unless noted otherwise, the following discussion of our cash flows and liquidity position include both continuing and discontinued operations.\nThe following discussion of the changes in our cash balance refers to the various sections of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities, which consists of net income adjusted for the various non-cash items included in income, changes in working capital and changes in certain other balance sheet accounts, totaled $392 million in fiscal 2016. Operating activities provided $499 million and $315 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016 was driven primarily by net income of $164 million plus $161 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization. In addition, there was a net decrease in accounts receivable and inventories largely driven by lower raw material costs and associated price reductions. These sources of cash were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 was driven primarily by our non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and asset impairments, which more than offset our net loss for the period. In addition, there was a net decrease in accounts receivable and inventories largely driven by lower raw material costs and associated price reductions.\nCash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 was driven primarily by net income of $218 million plus $201 million of depreciation and amortization and $25 million of dividends from equity affiliates, $14 million of which was received from NHUMO prior to our purchase of the remaining outstanding common stock of the joint venture. These sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories due to higher sales and the inclusion of NHUMO balances.\nIn addition to the factors noted above, the following other elements of operations have a bearing on operating cash flows:\nRestructurings - As of September 30, 2016, we had $5 million of total restructuring costs in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet related to our global restructuring activities. We made cash payments of $37 million during fiscal 2016 and received $16 million in cash payments in connection with the sale of land and land rights. In fiscal 2017 and thereafter, we expect to make cash payments totaling approximately $8 million related to these restructuring plans.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we restructured our operations in certain locations, including the closure of our carbon black manufacturing facility in Merak, Indonesia. These actions resulted in net cash outlays of approximately $29 million in fiscal 2016.\nWe may receive cash in the future from the sale of certain assets and land relating to restructured sites, which is not included in these amounts.\nEnvironmental Reserves and Litigation Matters-As of September 30, 2016, we have a $14 million reserve for environmental remediation costs at various sites. These sites are primarily associated with businesses divested in prior years. We anticipate that the expenditures at these sites will be made over a number of years, and will not be concentrated in any one year. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 we have a $21 million reserve for respirator claims. These expenditures will be incurred over many years. We also have other litigation costs arising in the ordinary course of business.\nThe following table represents the estimated future payments related to our environmental reserve.\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Future Payments by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Environmental\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nIn fiscal 2016, capital expenditures were $112 million. Major capital project expenditures were related to sustaining and compliance activities. In fiscal 2015, capital expenditures were $141 million. Major capital project expenditures were related to the completion of our lignite mine development project in the Purification Solutions segment, mine development activities for our Specialty Fluids segment, and sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities. In fiscal 2014, capital expenditures of $171 million and cash paid for NHUMO of $73 million (net of cash acquired of $7 million) were partially offset by the receipt of the final cash payment on the notes issued as part of the sale of our Supermetals business of $215 million and cash proceeds of $20 million received for the sale of our Security Materials business, which were classified as discontinued operations. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our lignite mine development project in the Purification Solutions segment, sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities, and mine development activities for the Specialty Fluids segment.\nCapital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be between $150 million and $175 million. Our planned capital spending program for fiscal 2017 is primarily for sustaining and compliance capital projects at our operating facilities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFinancing activities consumed $184 million of cash in fiscal 2016 compared to $256 million of cash in fiscal 2015 and $302 million in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2016, our overall debt balance decreased by $68 million. The decrease was driven primarily by our redemption of our $300 million 5% fixed rate debt and a reduction in our outstanding commercial paper, partially offset by the issuance of $250 million in registered notes with a coupon of 3.4% that mature on September 15, 2026. As of September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding notes under our commercial paper program. During fiscal 2015, our overall debt balance decreased by $78 million. The decrease was driven primarily by our repayment of certain long-term debt and commercial paper. As of September 30, 2015, we had outstanding notes under our commercial paper program in an aggregate amount of $12 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.36%.\nThe following table provides a summary of our outstanding debt.\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Variable rate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total variable rate debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed rate debt, net of discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unamortized bond discounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt September 30, 2016, we had $1 billion of availability under our credit agreement.\nOur long-term total debt, of which $1 million is current, matures at various times as presented in Note J. The weighted-average interest rate on our fixed rate long-term debt was 3.54% as of September 30, 2016.\nAt September 30, 2016, we have provided standby letters of credit totaling $16 million, which expire throughout fiscal 2017.\nOn October 23, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement that amended and extended our $750 million revolving credit agreement (which was scheduled to mature October 3, 2019). With this amendment and extension, we increased our borrowing availability to $1 billion. The credit agreement matures on October 23, 2020. The credit agreement continues to support our commercial paper program. Borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. The revolving credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, a single financial covenant (consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA) and events of default customary for financings of this type.\nOn September 27, 2016, we redeemed $300 million of 5% fixed rate debt that was issued in fiscal 2009 and had a maturity date of October 1, 2016.\nIn September 2016, Cabot issued $250 million in registered notes with a coupon of 3.4% that mature on September 15, 2026. The net proceeds of this offering were $248 million after deducting discounts and issuance costs.\nShare repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, we repurchased approximately 0.8 million, 2.3 million, and 0.2 million shares of our common stock on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $39 million, $96 million, and $11 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 2.8 million shares available for repurchase under the Board of Directors' share repurchase authorization.\nDividend payments\nIn fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid cash dividends on our common stock of $1.04, $0.88 and $0.84 per share, respectively. These cash dividend payments totaled $65 million in fiscal 2016, $56 million in fiscal 2015, and $54 million in fiscal 2014.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nAs of September 30, 2016, we had a consolidated pension obligation, net of the fair value of plan assets, of $170 million, comprised of $113 million for pension benefit plan liabilities and $57 million for postretirement benefit plan liabilities.\nThe $113 million of unfunded pension benefit plan liabilities is derived as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair Value of Plan Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unfunded Status\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (95\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (113\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn fiscal 2016, we made cash contributions totaling approximately $10 million to our foreign pension benefit plans. In fiscal 2017, we expect to make cash contributions of $8 million to our foreign pension plans.\nThe $57 million of unfunded postretirement benefit plan liabilities is comprised of $37 million for our U.S. and $20 million for our foreign postretirement benefit plans. These postretirement benefit plans provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Typical of such plans, our postretirement plans are unfunded and, therefore, have no plan assets. We fund these plans as claims or insurance premiums come due. In fiscal 2016, we paid postretirement benefits of $3 million under our U.S. postretirement plans and $1 million under our foreign postretirement plans. For fiscal 2017, our benefit payments for our postretirement plans are expected to be immaterial.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe had no material transactions that meet the definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our long-term contractual obligations.\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed interest on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We are unable to estimate the timing of potential future payments related to our accrual for uncertain tax positions in the amount of $18 million at September 30, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Capital lease obligations include interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase commitments\nWe have entered into long-term, volume-based purchase agreements primarily for the purchase of raw materials and natural gas with various key suppliers in Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, and Purification Solutions.

This preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if (i) the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (ii) different estimates and assumptions were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the application of our policies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are presented below.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts and Notes Receivable\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment. If we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms, the revenue is considered unearned\u201d and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nShipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Taxes collected on sales to customers are excluded from revenues.\nThe following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of the Company's reportable segments:\n\nWe derive the substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations. We periodically review the assumptions underlying estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly.\nRevenue in Purification Solutions is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. For major activated carbon injection systems projects, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\nRevenue in Specialty Fluids arises primarily from the rental of cesium formate. This revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms. Customers are also billed and revenue is recognized, typically at the end of the job, for cesium formate product that is not returned. We also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of a rental process and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the fluid.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis. Customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. There are no material changes in the allowance for any of the years presented. There is no material off-balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances.\nInventory Valuation\nThe cost of all carbon black inventories in the U.S. is determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method. Total U.S. inventories utilizing this cost flow assumption were $28 million and $24 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These inventories represent 8% and 6% of total worldwide inventories at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Had we used the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method instead of the LIFO method for such inventories, the value of those inventories would have been $27 million and $30 million higher as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cost of Specialty Fluids inventories, which are classified as assets held for rent, is determined using the average cost method. The cost of other U.S. and all non-U.S. inventories is determined using the FIFO method. In periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs, the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability. Under our current LIFO method, when raw material costs are rising, our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to Cost of sales. If, however, we were using a FIFO method, our purchases from earlier periods, which were at lower prices, would instead be the first charged to Cost of sales. The opposite result could occur during a period of rapid decline in raw material costs.\nAt certain times, we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the LIFO method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated. The inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs. If there is a liquidation of an inventory layer, there may be an impact to our Cost of sales and Net income for that period. If the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost, there would be a reduction in our Cost of sales and an increase to our Net income during the period. Conversely, if the liquidated inventory is at a cost higher than our current cost, there will be an increase in our Cost of sales and a reduction to our net income during the period.\nWe review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices periodically. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. Historically, such write-downs have not been material. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of May 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is at or below the operating segment level, and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The separate businesses included within Performance Chemicals are considered separate reporting units. The goodwill balance relative to this segment is recorded in the Metal Oxides reporting unit.\nFor the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an additional quantitative evaluation is performed under the two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform an analysis of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined to be less than its carrying amount, an impairment is recognized for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The fair value is also benchmarked against a market approach using the guideline public companies method. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's best estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. Should the fair value of any of our reporting units decline below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary.\nWhen we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and we recorded impairment charges as a result. A discussion of this assessment and the charges recorded is included under Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\nBased on our most recent annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2016, the fair values of the Reinforcement Materials and Fumed Metal Oxides reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 9% at that time. The fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit includes certain growth assumptions that are primarily dependent on: (1) further growth in the mercury removal related portion of the business, which is largely dependent on the amount of coal-based power generation used in the United States and the continued regulation of those utilities under MATS and (2) growth in demand for our activated carbon products in other applications, while meeting our margin expectations. Realizing these assumptions is generally driven by the macroeconomic environment, environmental regulations, and global and regional competition.\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the valuation model. We estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are comprised of trademarks, customer relationships and developed technologies, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. We recognized an impairment on intangible assets associated with the Purification Solutions business in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and no events have been subsequently identified that would require an additional impairment evaluation.\nLong-lived Assets Impairment\nOur long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments and assets held for rent. The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nTo test for impairment of assets we generally use a probability-weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable.\nAn asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the analysis described above, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. If the asset does not have a readily determinable market value, a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset. In circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset.\nPurification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\nDuring fiscal 2015 and as a result of the impairment tests performed on goodwill and long-lived assets of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we recorded impairment charges and an associated tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we used an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporated significant estimates and assumptions related to future periods, including the timing of the MATS implementation, the anticipated size of the mercury removal industry, and growth rates and pricing assumptions of activated carbon, among others. In addition, an estimate of the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present value. The WACC was based upon externally available data considering market participants' cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to the Purification Solutions reporting unit. Based on these estimates and as part of step one of the annual impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was lower than the reporting unit's carrying value. As such, the reporting unit failed step one of the goodwill impairment test. We then proceeded to step two.\nStep two of the goodwill impairment test requires us to perform a theoretical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill. The estimate of fair value is complex and requires significant judgment. Accounting guidance provides that we should recognize an estimated impairment charge to the extent that it determines that it is probable that an impairment loss has occurred and such impairment can be reasonably estimated. Based on our best estimate as of June 30, 2015, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $353 million. We completed the step two analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which resulted in recording a credit of $1 million to the pre-tax goodwill impairment charge.\nBased on the same factors leading to the goodwill impairment, we also considered whether the reporting unit's carrying values of definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are the trademarks of Purification Solutions, and determined that the fair value of these intangible assets was lower than their carrying value. As such, an impairment loss was recorded in the amount of $39 million. Subsequent to this impairment analysis, we concluded that such assets no longer had an indefinite life and began amortizing these assets over their estimated useful life. We also performed an impairment analysis to assess if definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the reporting unit, and determined that these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over their remaining useful lives. Accordingly, an impairment charge was recorded based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the long-lived assets. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets and a combination of the cost and market approaches to fair value our property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment charges of $119 million and $51 million, to our definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. We completed the impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 which resulted in increasing the property, plant and equipment impairment charge by $1 million to $52 million. Therefore, for the year ended September 30, 2015, the long-lived assets impairment charge was $210 million. In connection with the long-lived assets impairment charges, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $80 million to our income tax provision.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees. Plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions. The assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans, are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans (where applicable) and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. The most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets. Assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied; they include estimated discount rates, rates of compensation increases for employees, and mortality, employee turnover and other related demographic data. Projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. However, cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nWe are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and environmental litigation. After consultation with counsel, as appropriate, we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range. Our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information, including claims, settlement offers, demands by government agencies, estimates performed by independent third parties, identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute, and our prior experience. Litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims. The amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites, the nature of the remedies, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. These liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information, changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations, which could result in higher or lower costs.\nOur current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time. Developments that could affect our estimate include, but are not limited to, (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending claims, (iii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iv) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (v) changes in the nature of claims received, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) the financial viability of other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, (viii) a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by certain of the other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, or the indemnity provided by a former owner of the business, (ix) changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and (x) a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable. We cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims. Accordingly, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The depreciable lives for buildings, machinery and equipment, and other fixed assets are twenty to twenty-five years, ten to twenty-five years, and three to twenty-five years, respectively. The cost and accumulated depreciation for property, plant and equipment sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and resulting gains or losses are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which significantly extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.\nIncome Taxes\nOur business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries. We file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction's tax laws.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow.\nWe record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This analysis presumes the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts, but does not consider the time value of money. We also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdditionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry-forwards, foreign tax credits, and other income tax credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time. We review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis. Failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets. An increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nWe have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in Note A of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Certain of these policies include the use of estimates, but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure. However, these policies are important to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nCabot is organized into four reportable business segments: Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, Purification Solutions, and Specialty Fluids. Cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. The discussions of our results of operations for the periods presented reflect these structures.\nOur analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Unless a calendar year is specified, all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended September 30.\nDefinition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen discussing our results of operations, we use several terms as described below.\nThe term product mix\u201d refers to the mix of types and grades of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold, and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business and/or segment.\nThe term LIFO\u201d includes two factors: (i) the impact of current inventory costs being recognized immediately in Cost of sales under a last-in first-out method, compared to the older costs that would have been included in Cost of sales under a first-in first-out method ( Cost of sales impact\u201d); and (ii) the impact of reductions in inventory quantities, causing historical inventory costs to flow through Cost of sales ( liquidation impact\u201d).\nOur discussion under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d includes a discussion of our effective tax rate\u201d and our operating tax rate\u201d and includes a reconciliation of the two rates. Our operating tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In calculating our operating tax rate, we exclude discrete tax items, which include: i) unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release or establishment of a valuation allowance, ii) items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements, interest on tax reserves, and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations, and iii) other discrete tax items, such as the tax impact of legislative changes and, on a quarterly basis, the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment, if applicable. We also exclude the tax impact of certain items, as defined below in the discussion of Total segment EBIT, on both operating income and the tax provision. Our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nOur discussion under the heading Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014-By Business Segment\u201d includes a discussion of Total segment EBIT, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses segment EBIT to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments. We believe Total segment EBIT, which reflects the sum of EBIT from our four reportable segments, provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance, allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management, and provides context for our discussion of individual business segment performance. Total segment EBIT should not be considered an alternative for Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Total segment EBIT to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided in Note U of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Investors should consider the limitations associated with this non-GAAP measure, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another.\nIn calculating Total segment EBIT, we exclude from our Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies (i) items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of our fundamental on-going segment results, which we refer to as certain items\u201d, and (ii) items that, because they are not controlled by the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). This preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the financial statements if (i) the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (ii) different estimates and assumptions were used, the results could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the application of our policies. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are presented below.\nRevenue Recognition and Accounts and Notes Receivable\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment. If we are unable to determine that the product has met the specified objective criteria prior to shipment or if title has not transferred because of sales terms, the revenue is considered unearned\u201d and is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met.\nShipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenue when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Taxes collected on sales to customers are excluded from revenues.\nThe following table shows the relative size of the revenue recognized in each of the Company's reportable segments:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended September 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinforcement Materials\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Performance Chemicals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purification Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Fluids\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe derive the substantial majority of revenues from the sale of products in Reinforcement Materials and Performance Chemicals. Revenue from these products is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. We offer certain customers cash discounts and volume rebates as sales incentives. The discounts and volume rebates are recorded as a reduction in sales at the time revenue is recognized and are estimated based on historical experience and contractual obligations. We periodically review the assumptions underlying estimates of discounts and volume rebates and adjust revenues accordingly.\nRevenue in Purification Solutions is typically recognized when the product is shipped and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. For major activated carbon injection systems projects, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\nRevenue in Specialty Fluids arises primarily from the rental of cesium formate. This revenue is recognized throughout the rental period based on the contracted rental terms. Customers are also billed and revenue is recognized, typically at the end of the job, for cesium formate product that is not returned. We also generate revenues from cesium formate sold outside of a rental process and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the fluid.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts, the aging of accounts receivable and other economic information on both a historical and prospective basis. Customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. There are no material changes in the allowance for any of the years presented. There is no material off-balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances.\nInventory Valuation\nThe cost of all carbon black inventories in the U.S. is determined using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) method. Total U.S. inventories utilizing this cost flow assumption were $28 million and $24 million at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These inventories represent 8% and 6% of total worldwide inventories at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Had we used the first-in, first-out ( FIFO\u201d) method instead of the LIFO method for such inventories, the value of those inventories would have been $27 million and $30 million higher as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cost of Specialty Fluids inventories, which are classified as assets held for rent, is determined using the average cost method. The cost of other U.S. and all non-U.S. inventories is determined using the FIFO method. In periods of rapidly rising or declining raw material costs, the inventory method we employ can have a significant impact on our profitability. Under our current LIFO method, when raw material costs are rising, our most recent higher priced purchases are the first to be charged to Cost of sales. If, however, we were using a FIFO method, our purchases from earlier periods, which were at lower prices, would instead be the first charged to Cost of sales. The opposite result could occur during a period of rapid decline in raw material costs.\nAt certain times, we may decrease inventory levels to the point where layers of inventory recorded under the LIFO method that were purchased in preceding years are liquidated. The inventory in these layers may be valued at an amount that is different than our current costs. If there is a liquidation of an inventory layer, there may be an impact to our Cost of sales and Net income for that period. If the liquidated inventory is at a cost lower than our current cost, there would be a reduction in our Cost of sales and an increase to our Net income during the period. Conversely, if the liquidated inventory is at a cost higher than our current cost, there will be an increase in our Cost of sales and a reduction to our net income during the period.\nWe review inventory for both potential obsolescence and potential declines in anticipated selling prices periodically. In this review, we make assumptions about the future demand for and market value of the inventory and based on these assumptions estimate the amount of any obsolete, unmarketable, slow moving or overvalued inventory. We write down the value of our inventories by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value. Historically, such write-downs have not been material. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at the time of the assessment, however, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could reduce our gross profit and our earnings.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill Impairment\nWe record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Amounts paid for an acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is comprised of the purchase price of business acquisitions in excess of the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually as of May 31, or when events or changes in the business environment indicate that the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. A reporting unit, for the purpose of the impairment test, is at or below the operating segment level, and constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. The separate businesses included within Performance Chemicals are considered separate reporting units. The goodwill balance relative to this segment is recorded in the Metal Oxides reporting unit.\nFor the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an additional quantitative evaluation is performed under the two-step impairment test. Alternatively, we may elect to proceed directly to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If based on the quantitative evaluation the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform an analysis of the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined to be less than its carrying amount, an impairment is recognized for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is based on discounted estimated future cash flows. The fair value is also benchmarked against a market approach using the guideline public companies method. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's best estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, capital expenditures and discount rates over an estimate of the remaining operating period at the reporting unit level. Should the fair value of any of our reporting units decline below its carrying amount because of reduced operating performance, market declines, changes in the discount rate, or other conditions, charges for impairment may be necessary.\nWhen we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was less than its carrying amount and we recorded impairment charges as a result. A discussion of this assessment and the charges recorded is included under Purification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\u201d.\nBased on our most recent annual goodwill impairment test performed as of May 31, 2016, the fair values of the Reinforcement Materials and Fumed Metal Oxides reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. The fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 9% at that time. The fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit includes certain growth assumptions that are primarily dependent on: (1) further growth in the mercury removal related portion of the business, which is largely dependent on the amount of coal-based power generation used in the United States and the continued regulation of those utilities under MATS and (2) growth in demand for our activated carbon products in other applications, while meeting our margin expectations. Realizing these assumptions is generally driven by the macroeconomic environment, environmental regulations, and global and regional competition.\nWe use assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to assumptions used in the valuation model. We estimate the fair value of identifiable acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from these assets. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the fair value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, which are comprised of trademarks, customer relationships and developed technologies, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists, such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets. We recognized an impairment on intangible assets associated with the Purification Solutions business in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 and no events have been subsequently identified that would require an additional impairment evaluation.\nLong-lived Assets Impairment\nOur long-lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, long-term investments and assets held for rent. The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nTo test for impairment of assets we generally use a probability-weighted estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to determine if the value of the asset is recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which independent identifiable cash flows are determinable.\nAn asset impairment is recognized when the carrying value of the asset is not recoverable based on the analysis described above, in which case the asset is written down to its fair value. If the asset does not have a readily determinable market value, a discounted cash flow model may be used to determine the fair value of the asset. In circumstances when an asset does not have separate identifiable cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded when we no longer intend to use the asset.\nPurification Solutions Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets Impairment Charges\nDuring fiscal 2015 and as a result of the impairment tests performed on goodwill and long-lived assets of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we recorded impairment charges and an associated tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as follows:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Goodwill impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-lived assets impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Benefit for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment charges, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn determining the fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit, we used an income approach (a discounted cash flow analysis) which incorporated significant estimates and assumptions related to future periods, including the timing of the MATS implementation, the anticipated size of the mercury removal industry, and growth rates and pricing assumptions of activated carbon, among others. In addition, an estimate of the reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) was used to discount future estimated cash flows to their present value. The WACC was based upon externally available data considering market participants' cost of equity and debt, optimal capital structure and risk factors specific to the Purification Solutions reporting unit. Based on these estimates and as part of step one of the annual impairment test, we determined that the estimated fair value of the Purification Solutions reporting unit was lower than the reporting unit's carrying value. As such, the reporting unit failed step one of the goodwill impairment test. We then proceeded to step two.\nStep two of the goodwill impairment test requires us to perform a theoretical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the recorded amount of goodwill. The estimate of fair value is complex and requires significant judgment. Accounting guidance provides that we should recognize an estimated impairment charge to the extent that it determines that it is probable that an impairment loss has occurred and such impairment can be reasonably estimated. Based on our best estimate as of June 30, 2015, we recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $353 million. We completed the step two analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which resulted in recording a credit of $1 million to the pre-tax goodwill impairment charge.\nBased on the same factors leading to the goodwill impairment, we also considered whether the reporting unit's carrying values of definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment may not be recoverable or whether the carrying value of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets were impaired. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are the trademarks of Purification Solutions, and determined that the fair value of these intangible assets was lower than their carrying value. As such, an impairment loss was recorded in the amount of $39 million. Subsequent to this impairment analysis, we concluded that such assets no longer had an indefinite life and began amortizing these assets over their estimated useful life. We also performed an impairment analysis to assess if definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recoverable based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the reporting unit, and determined that these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the long-lived assets over their remaining useful lives. Accordingly, an impairment charge was recorded based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of the long-lived assets. We used the income approach to determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets and a combination of the cost and market approaches to fair value our property, plant and equipment. We recorded impairment charges of $119 million and $51 million, to our definite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, respectively, in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. We completed the impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 which resulted in increasing the property, plant and equipment impairment charge by $1 million to $52 million. Therefore, for the year ended September 30, 2015, the long-lived assets impairment charge was $210 million. In connection with the long-lived assets impairment charges, we recorded a deferred tax benefit of $80 million to our income tax provision.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain both defined benefit and defined contribution plans for our employees. In addition, we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for our retired employees. Plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions. The assumptions, which are specific for each of our U.S. and foreign plans, are related to both the assets we hold to fund our plans (where applicable) and the characteristics of the benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees. The most significant assumptions relative to our plan assets include the anticipated rates of return on these assets. Assumptions relative to our pension obligations are more varied; they include estimated discount rates, rates of compensation increases for employees, and mortality, employee turnover and other related demographic data. Projected health care and life insurance obligations also rely on the above mentioned demographic assumptions and assumptions surrounding health care cost trends. Actual results that differ from the assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods and could therefore affect the recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods. However, cash flow requirements may be different from the amounts of expense that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.\nLitigation and Contingencies\nWe are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business, including personal injury and environmental litigation. After consultation with counsel, as appropriate, we accrue a liability for litigation when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The estimated reserves are recorded based on our best estimate of the liability associated with such matters or the low end of the estimated range of liability if we are unable to identify a better estimate within that range. Our best estimate is determined through the evaluation of various information, including claims, settlement offers, demands by government agencies, estimates performed by independent third parties, identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute, and our prior experience. Litigation is highly uncertain and there is always the possibility of an unusual result in any particular case that may reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe most significant reserves that we have established are for environmental remediation and respirator litigation claims. The amount accrued for environmental matters reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated sites, the nature of the remedies, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. These liabilities can be affected by the availability of new information, changes in the assumptions on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action or changes in applicable government laws and regulations, which could result in higher or lower costs.\nOur current estimate of the cost of our share of existing and future respirator liability claims is based on facts and circumstances existing at this time. Developments that could affect our estimate include, but are not limited to, (i) significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii) changes in the rate of dismissals without payment of pending claims, (iii) significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iv) significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (v) changes in the nature of claims received, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii) the financial viability of other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, (viii) a change in the availability of insurance coverage maintained by certain of the other parties which contribute to the settlement of respirator claims, or the indemnity provided by a former owner of the business, (ix) changes in the allocation of costs among the various parties paying legal and settlement costs and (x) a determination that the assumptions that were used to estimate our share of liability are no longer reasonable. We cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on our current estimate of our share of liability for these existing and future claims. Accordingly, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be different than the reserved amount.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The depreciable lives for buildings, machinery and equipment, and other fixed assets are twenty to twenty-five years, ten to twenty-five years, and three to twenty-five years, respectively. The cost and accumulated depreciation for property, plant and equipment sold, retired, or otherwise disposed of are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and resulting gains or losses are included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expenses as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which significantly extend the useful lives of existing plant and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated.\nIncome Taxes\nOur business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change based on the political and economic climate in those countries. We file our tax returns in accordance with our interpretations of each jurisdiction's tax laws.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations which make the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest and penalties that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow.\nWe record benefits for uncertain tax positions based on an assessment of whether the position is more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities. If this threshold is not met, no tax benefit of the uncertain tax position is recognized. If the threshold is met, the tax benefit that is recognized is the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This analysis presumes the taxing authorities' full knowledge of the positions taken and all relevant facts, but does not consider the time value of money. We also accrue for interest and penalties on these uncertain tax positions and include such charges in the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAdditionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carry-forwards, foreign tax credits, and other income tax credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Our ability to utilize these deferred tax assets is dependent on achieving our forecast of future taxable operating income over an extended period of time. We review our forecast in relation to actual results and expected trends on a quarterly basis. Failure to achieve our operating income targets may change our assessment regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and such change could result in a valuation allowance being recorded against some or all of our net deferred tax assets. An increase in a valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense, while a release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our income tax expense.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nWe have other significant accounting policies that are discussed in Note A of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below. Certain of these policies include the use of estimates, but do not meet the definition of critical because they generally do not require estimates or judgments that are as difficult or subjective to measure. However, these policies are important to an understanding of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nResults of Operations\nCabot is organized into four reportable business segments: Reinforcement Materials, Performance Chemicals, Purification Solutions, and Specialty Fluids. Cabot is also organized for operational purposes into three geographic regions: the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa; and Asia Pacific. The discussions of our results of operations for the periods presented reflect these structures.\nOur analysis of financial condition and operating results should be read with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Unless a calendar year is specified, all references to years in this discussion are to our fiscal years ended September 30.\nDefinition of Terms and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWhen discussing our results of operations, we use several terms as described below.\nThe term product mix\u201d refers to the mix of types and grades of products sold or the mix of geographic regions where products are sold, and the positive or negative impact this has on the revenue or profitability of the business and/or segment.\nThe term LIFO\u201d includes two factors: (i) the impact of current inventory costs being recognized immediately in Cost of sales under a last-in first-out method, compared to the older costs that would have been included in Cost of sales under a first-in first-out method ( Cost of sales impact\u201d); and (ii) the impact of reductions in inventory quantities, causing historical inventory costs to flow through Cost of sales ( liquidation impact\u201d).\nOur discussion under the heading Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes and Reconciliation of Effective Tax Rate to Operating Tax Rate\u201d includes a discussion of our effective tax rate\u201d and our operating tax rate\u201d and includes a reconciliation of the two rates. Our operating tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to our effective tax rate, the most comparable GAAP financial measure. In calculating our operating tax rate, we exclude discrete tax items, which include: i) unusual or infrequent items such as a significant release or establishment of a valuation allowance, ii) items related to uncertain tax positions such as the tax impact of audit settlements, interest on tax reserves, and the release of tax reserves from the expiration of statutes of limitations, and iii) other discrete tax items, such as the tax impact of legislative changes and, on a quarterly basis, the timing of losses in certain jurisdictions and the cumulative rate adjustment, if applicable. We also exclude the tax impact of certain items, as defined below in the discussion of Total segment EBIT, on both operating income and the tax provision. Our definition of the operating tax rate may not be comparable to the definition used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information because it helps our investors compare our tax rate year to year on a consistent basis and understand what our tax rate on current operations would be without the impact of these items.\nOur discussion under the heading Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2015 compared to Fiscal 2014-By Business Segment\u201d includes a discussion of Total segment EBIT, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Our Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, uses segment EBIT to evaluate the operating results of each segment and to allocate resources to the segments. We believe Total segment EBIT, which reflects the sum of EBIT from our four reportable segments, provides useful supplemental information for our investors as it is an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance, allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management, and provides context for our discussion of individual business segment performance. Total segment EBIT should not be considered an alternative for Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Total segment EBIT to Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies is provided in Note U of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Investors should consider the limitations associated with this non-GAAP measure, including the potential lack of comparability of this measure from one company to another.\nIn calculating Total segment EBIT, we exclude from our Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in earnings of affiliated companies (i) items of expense and income that management does not consider representative of our fundamental on-going segment results, which we refer to as certain items\u201d, and (ii) items that, because they are not controlled by the"}
