Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis includes certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by such forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this report.\nOverview\nWe offer a wide range of commercial, small business, consumer and municipal banking products and services. We conduct our consumer and small business deposit operations primarily through online channels on a nationwide basis and have no traditional branch offices. Our residential mortgage products are offered nationwide primarily through an online direct-to-consumer platform and are supplemented with Central Indiana-based mortgage and construction lending. Our consumer lending products are primarily originated on a nationwide basis over the Internet as well as through relationships with dealerships and financing partners.\nOur commercial banking products and services are delivered through a relationship banking model and include commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) banking, commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) banking, public finance, healthcare finance and commercial deposits and treasury management. Through our CRE team, we offer single tenant lease financing on a nationwide basis in addition to traditional investor CRE and construction loans primarily within Central Indiana and adjacent markets. To meet the needs of commercial borrowers and depositors located primarily in Central Indiana, Phoenix, Arizona and adjacent markets, our C&I banking team provides credit solutions such as lines of credit, term loans, owner-occupied CRE loans and corporate credit cards. Our public finance team, established in early 2017, provides a range of public and municipal lending and leasing products to government entities on a nationwide basis. Healthcare finance was established in the second quarter of 2017 in conjunction with our strategic partnership with Lendeavor, Inc., a San Francisco-based technology-enabled lender to healthcare practices, and provides lending for healthcare practice finance or acquisition, acquiring or refinancing owner-occupied CRE and equipment purchases. Initial efforts within healthcare finance have primarily focused on the West Coast with plans to expand nationwide. Our commercial deposits and treasury management team works with the other commercial teams to provide deposit products and treasury management services to our commercial and municipal lending customers as well as pursues commercial deposit opportunities in business segments where we have no credit relationships.\nResults of Operations\nRefer to Item 6 of this report for a summary of the Company's financial performance for the five most recent years.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net income was $21.9 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.2 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and net income of $12.1 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe $6.7 million increase in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to an $8.3 million increase in net interest income, a $5.7 million decrease in income tax expense and a $1.0 million decrease in provision for loan losses, but was partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in noninterest expense and a $1.8 million decrease in noninterest income.\nThe increase in net income of $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to a $14.3 million increase in net interest income, but was partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in noninterest income, a $5.3 million increase in noninterest expense, a $0.5 million increase in provision for loan losses and a $1.8 million increase in income tax expense.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, return on average assets was 0.72%, compared to 0.66% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 0.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, return on average shareholders' equity was 8.44%, compared to 8.54% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 9.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2018, the Company recorded a $2.4 million write-down of a commercial other real estate owned property that consists of two buildings. The revaluation of the other real estate owned was driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the property is located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. As a\nresult, this write-down decreased 2018 net income by $1.9 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.20. Adjusted for the write-down, 2018 net income was $23.8 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.50. The write-down also decreased return on average assets by 6 basis points ( bps\u201d) and return on average shareholders' equity by 74 bps. Adjusted for the write-down, 2018 return on average assets was 0.78% and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.18%. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn 2017, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), the Company's net deferred tax asset ( net DTA\u201d) was revalued as of December 31, 2017. The value of the net DTA was reduced by $1.8 million with the amount of the reduction recognized as additional income tax expense in 2017. Consequently, this revaluation decreased 2017 diluted earnings per share by $0.26. Adjusted for the net DTA revaluation, 2017 net income was $17.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.39. The revaluation also decreased return on average assets by 8 bps and return on average shareholders' equity by 104 bps. Adjusted for the net DTA revaluation, 2017 return on average assets was 0.74% and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.58%. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nConsolidated Average Balance Sheets and Net Interest Income Analyses\nFor the periods presented, the following tables provide the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the related yields and cost of funds. The tables do not reflect any effect of income taxes. Balances are based on the average of daily balances. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase in net interest income was the result of a $30.8 million, or 36.3%, increase in total interest income to $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $84.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in total interest income was partially offset by a $22.5 million, or 73.2%, increase in total interest expense to $53.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $700.3 million, or 41.6%, in the average balance of loans, including loans held-for-sale, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as well as an increase of $36.6 million in the average balance of other earning assets and a 77 basis point (\"bp\") increase in the yield earned on other earning assets. The increase in total interest income was also due to a 19 bp increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio, partially offset by a $10.1 million, or 2.0%, decrease in the average balance of securities and a decline in the yield earned on loans, including loans held-for-sale, of 3 bps.\nThe increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $558.4 million, or 32.6%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of 47 bps in the cost of funds related to these deposits. Interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense, due to a $91.9 million, or 24.4%, increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of 50 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds.\nNet interest margin was 2.09% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 47 bp increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 12 bp increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was due primarily to an increase in average certificates and brokered deposits and money market balances and an increase in the related costs of those deposits. The increase in the cost of these deposits was due primarily to the rise of short-term market interest rates throughout 2018. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the yields earned on securities and other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on loans. The decrease in the yield earned on loans was due primarily to continued strong growth in the public finance portfolio, which typically has lower tax-exempt interest rates, partially offset by higher yields in other commercial loan categories and residential mortgage loans resulting form higher market interest rates.\n2017 v. 2016\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $54.0 million, an increase of $14.3 million, or 36.0%, compared to $39.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income was the result of a $25.8 million, or 43.8%, increase in total interest income to $84.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $58.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in total interest income was partially offset by an $11.5 million, or 59.9%, increase in total interest expense to $30.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $19.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $537.6 million, or 47.0%, in the average balance of loans, including loans held-for-sale, as well as an increase in interest earned on securities resulting from an increase of $115.6 million, or 30.4%, in the average balance of securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in total interest income was also due to a 17 bp increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio, partially offset by a decline of 10 bps in the yield earned on loans, including loans held-for-sale.\nThe increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $425.6 million, or 33.0%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of 17 bps in the cost of funds related to these deposits. Interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense, due to a $193.1 million, or 105.3%, increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by a decline of 4 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds.\nNet interest margin was 2.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 16 bp increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 6 bp increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in average certificates of deposits, money market balances and other borrowed funds and an increase in the related costs of those deposits. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the yields earned on securities and other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on loans. The decrease in the yield earned on loans was due primarily to strong growth in the public finance portfolio which typically has lower tax-exempt interest rates.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents noninterest income for the five most recent years.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service charges and fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking activities\n</td> <td>5,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of loans\n</td> <td>503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 v. 2017\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income totaled $8.8 million, representing a decrease of $1.8 million, or 16.9%, compared to $10.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $2.1 million, or 27.0%, in mortgage banking activities, partially offset by gains on sale of loans and other noninterest income. The decrease in revenue from mortgage banking activities was due primarily to decreases in mortgage held-for-sale (\"HFS\") origination and sales volumes, due to a decline in mortgage refinance activity, and a decrease in gain on sale margin.\n2017 v. 2016\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income totaled $10.5 million, representing a decrease of $3.5 million, or 25.1%, compared to $14.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $4.6 million, or 36.8%, in mortgage banking activities, partially offset by gains on sale of loans and other noninterest income. The decrease in revenue from mortgage banking activities was due primarily to decreases in mortgage held-for-sale HFS origination and sales volumes. During 2017, portfolio mortgage originations increased relative to the comparable period in 2016 while mortgage HFS volume declined, contributing to the decline in revenue from mortgage banking activities. The increase in gain on sale of loans was due to the sale of $24.7 million of single tenant lease financing loans, which was the first sale of this loan type in the Company's history. The increase in other noninterest income was due primarily to a $0.4 million increase in income from bank-owned life insurance and a $0.4 million increase in income from subleasing the Company's former corporate office.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the five most recent years.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, advertising and promotion\n</td> <td>2,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting and professional services\n</td> <td>3,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>1,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan expenses\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premises and equipment\n</td> <td>4,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit insurance premium\n</td> <td>1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-down of other real estate owned\n</td> <td>2,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 v. 2017\nNoninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $43.2 million, compared to $36.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $6.5 million, or 17.6%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $2.4 million write-down of other real estate owned, a $2.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $0.8 million increase in premises and equipment expenses and a $0.5 million increase in deposit insurance premium expenses. The write-down of other real estate owned was due to the revaluation of one commercial property, consisting of two buildings, driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the properties are located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to changes in employee mix. Although the number of full-time employees decreased from 2017, recent hires in the Company's commercial lending verticals and support areas were generally in higher skill positions and led to an increase in employee salary and equity compensation expense. Additionally, the Company experienced an increase in benefits expense, primarily related to higher medical, prescription drug and dental insurance claims. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense primarily related to a reduction in senior management incentive compensation due to 2018 financial performance being below the targets established under the Company's Annual Bonus Plan for 2018. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to technology-related expenses and the increase in deposit insurance premium was due primarily to the Company's year-over-year asset growth, which impacts the formula used by the FDIC to calculate deposit insurance.\n2017 v. 2016\nNoninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $36.7 million, compared to $31.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $5.3 million, or 16.8%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to increases of $3.8 million in salaries and employee benefits, $0.6 million in marketing, advertising and promotion expenses, $0.5 million in premises and equipment expenses, $0.5 million in other and $0.3 million in deposit insurance premium expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by merit compensation increases; personnel growth; higher claims experience related to medical, prescription drug and dental insurance; and equity compensation expense. The increase in marketing, advertising and promotion expenses was driven primarily by digital marketing initiatives and higher mortgage lead generation costs. The increase in premises and equipment was due primarily to technology-related expenses. The increase in other was due primarily to repairs and maintenance expenses related to commercial OREO and the increase in deposit insurance premium was due primarily to the Company's year-over-year asset growth, which impacts the formula used by the FDIC to calculate deposit insurance.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory federal tax rate for the five most recent years.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory rate times pre-tax income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (subtract) the tax effect of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from tax-exempt securities and loans\n</td> <td>(3,833\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(635\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes, net of federal tax effect\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank-owned life insurance\n</td> <td>(200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net deferred tax asset revaluation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax credits\n</td> <td>(180\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other differences\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,052\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,702\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 v. 2017\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of $2.1 million in 2018, resulting in an effective tax rate of 8.6%, compared to $7.7 million and an effective tax rate of 33.6% in 2017. The Company's federal statutory tax rate was 21% in 2018 and 35% in 2017. In 2018, the variance from the federal statutory rate was due primarily to tax-exempt income, partially offset by state income taxes. Interest income on certain loans issued by or securities made to governmental, municipal and not-for-profit entities, and earnings from bank-owned life insurance were the primary components of tax-exempt income. In 2017, the variance from the federal statutory rate was due primarily to tax-exempt income, partially offset by state income taxes and the net deferred tax asset revaluation as a result of the Tax Act as discussed further in the paragraph below. Excluding the impact of the net deferred tax asset revaluation, income tax expense in 2017 was $5.9 million and the effective tax rate was 25.5%. Refer to the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law, significantly reforming the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction of the corporate tax rate resulted in a $1.8 million reduction to our net deferred tax asset in 2017.\n2017 v. 2016\nThe Company recognized income tax expense of $7.7 million in 2017, resulting in an effective tax rate of 33.6%, compared to $5.9 million and an effective tax rate of 32.6% in 2016. The federal statutory tax rate was 35% in 2017 and 34% in 2016. In 2017, the variance from the federal statutory rate was due primarily to tax-exempt income, partially offset by state income taxes and the net deferred tax asset revaluation as a result of the Tax Act, as discussed in the paragraph above. In 2016, the variance from the federal statutory rate was due primarily to tax-exempt income, partially offset by state income taxes.

with public finance loans.\nThe Company continued to experience strong loan growth as total loans rose to $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, an increase of $625.0 million, or 29.9%, compared to December 31, 2017. During 2017, the Company launched its public finance lending efforts and established a strategic partnership with Lendeavor, Inc., a San Francisco-based technology-enabled lender to healthcare practices, which provides loans for healthcare practice finance or acquisition, acquiring or refinancing owner-occupied CRE and equipment purchases. In 2018, both of these initiatives contributed to the increase in total loans as public finance and healthcare finance balances were $706.3 million and $117.0 million, respectively, at December 31, 2018. Single tenant lease financing had sustained production with balances increasing $116.1 million, or 14.5%, during 2018 as market conditions for this product remained favorable and the Company expanded its relationships with borrowers and financing partners. Residential mortgage balances increased $100.0 million, or 33.3%, during 2018 due primarily to growth in the Company's local residential construction-to-permanent loan origination efforts. Additionally, other consumer loans increased $52.2 million, or 23.0%, during 2018 due to increased originations in horse trailer and recreational vehicle loans.\nThe Company completed sales of single tenant lease financing loans, totaling $41.1 million in the aggregate in 2018, resulting in a gain of $0.5 million, and totaling $24.7 million in the aggregate in 2017, resulting in a gain of $0.4 million. The Company also completed sales of portfolio mortgage loans, which consisted of jumbo fixed and adjustable rate mortgages, and supplemented its conventional held-for-sale mortgage production during 2017. These sales totaled $42.3 million in the aggregate in 2017 and resulted in a $0.3 million gain.\nLoan Maturities and Rate Sensitivity\nThe following table shows the contractual maturity distribution intervals of the outstanding loans in our portfolio as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Within 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Beyond 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Owner-occupied commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investor commercial real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,838\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Single tenant lease financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>677,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>919,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>706,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Healthcare finance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,551,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,990,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>395,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>399,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commercial and consumer loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,209,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,698,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the rate sensitivity of the outstanding loans in our portfolio by the contractual maturity distribution intervals as of December 31, 2018.

Loan officers have underwriting and approval authorization of varying amounts based on their lending experience and product type. Additionally, based on the amount of the loan, multiple approvals may be required. Based on the Company's legal lending limit, the maximum the Bank could lend to any one borrower at December 31, 2018 was $45.6 million.\nOur goal is to have a well-diversified and balanced loan portfolio. In order to manage our loan portfolio risk, we establish concentration limits by borrower, product type, industry and geography. To supplement our internal loan review resources, we have engaged independent third-party loan review groups, which are a key component of our overall risk management process related to credit administration.\nAsset Quality\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

information or events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due (principal and interest) according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Payments with delays generally not exceeding 90 days outstanding are not considered impaired. Certain nonaccrual and substantially all delinquent loans more than 90 days past due may be considered to be impaired. Generally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status at 90 days past due and accrued interest is reversed against earnings, unless the\nloan is well secured and in the process of collection. The accrual of interest on impaired and nonaccrual loans is discontinued when, in management's opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due.\nImpaired loans include nonperforming loans but also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs\u201d) where concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, or other actions intended to maximize collection.\nNonperforming loans are comprised of total nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days past due and accruing. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets, which consist of repossessed assets. Nonperforming assets also included investments that were classified as other-than-temporarily impaired.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troubled debt restructurings - nonaccrual\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Troubled debt restructurings - performing\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total troubled debt restructurings\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,130\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased $2.4 million, or 40.5%, from December 31, 2017. The decrease in total nonperforming assets was due primarily to a $2.4 million write-down of one commercial other real estate owned property. The revaluation of the other real estate owned was driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the property is located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. Total nonperforming loans increased less than $0.1 million compared to December 31, 2017. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 0.03% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 0.04% as of December 31, 2017.

The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the provision are based on the review and evaluation of the loan portfolio and reflect management's assessment of the risks and potential losses within the portfolio. This evaluation considers historical loss experience as well as qualitative factors such as economic and business conditions, portfolio growth, concentrations of credit in the portfolio, trends in risk grades and delinquencies within the portfolio and changes in our lending policies and practices.\nManagement actively monitors asset quality and, when appropriate, charges off loans against the allowance for loan losses. Although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the economic conditions in the assumptions used to determine the size of the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $17.9 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $15.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase of $2.9 million, or 19.5%, was due primarily to the continued growth in loan balances. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $1.0 million, compared to net charge-offs of $0.9 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.66% as of December 31, 2018 compared to 0.72% as of December 31, 2017, and increased as a percentage of nonperforming loans to 2,013.1% as of December 31, 2018, from to 1,784.3% as of December 31, 2017. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was due primarily to the growth in the public finance loan portfolio, and, to a lesser extent, residential mortgage loans, as these loan categories have lower loss reserve factors than other loan types.\nInvestment Securities\nIn managing the Company's investment securities portfolio, management focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing an interest rate-sensitive position, while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk. Investment securities that are acquired and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term with the objective of generating economic profits on short-term differences in market characteristics are classified as securities held for trading. Securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity securities, and all other investment securities are classified as available-for-sale. The carrying values of available-for-sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains or losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after-tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Company periodically evaluates each security in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is temporary or other-than-temporary. As of December 31, 2018, the unrealized losses in the Company's investment securities portfolio were due primarily to interest rate changes. The Company has the ability and intent to hold all investment securities with identified impairments resulting from interest rate changes to the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security. As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any investment securities of a single issuer that exceeded 10% of shareholders' equity. The term \"issuer\" excludes the U.S. Government and its sponsored agencies and corporations.\nThe following tables present the amortized cost and approximate fair value of the Company's investment

increased $8.1 million, or 1.7%, to $481.3 million as of December 31, 2018 compared to $473.3 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to increases of $33.2 million in mortgage-backed securities and $7.4 million in corporate securities. The increase in mortgage-backed securities was driven by purchases as excess liquidity was deployed, partially offset by market value declines due to interest rate changes and principal amortization. Additional liquidity was also used to purchase corporate securities during 2018. These increases were offset by decreases of $25.6 million in U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, $3.9 million in municipal securities, $2.9 million in other securities and $0.2 million in asset-backed securities. The decrease in U.S. Government-sponsored agencies was due primarily to principal amortization and prepayments. The decrease in the approximate fair value of municipal securities was primarily caused by interest rate changes. The decline in other securities was due to the reclassification of a mutual fund with a readily determinable fair value to other assets in accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-01. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had securities with an amortized cost basis of $22.8 million designated as held-to-maturity compared to $19.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nInvestment

weighted average yield related to securities of U.S. Government-sponsored agencies with contractual maturities of more than 1 year to 5 years is due primarily to accelerated premium amortization resulting from principal prepayments.\nOther Assets\nDuring 2018, the Bank's subsidiary, SPF15, Inc., acquired several parcels of land consisting of approximately 3.3 acres located in Fishers, Indiana for approximately $10.2 million, inclusive of acquisition costs. Pursuant to a Land Acquisition Agreement among SPF15, Inc. ( SPF15\u201d), the City of Fishers, Indiana (the City\u201d), and its Redevelopment Commission (the RDC\u201d), among others, the City agreed to reimburse SPF15 for the purchase price and other specified land acquisition costs on or before December 31, 2018. On December 17, 2018, the City approved a Project Agreement that replaced the Land Acquisition Agreement. The Project Agreement extended the reimbursement deadline to October 30, 2019. The Project Agreement makes additional financial incentives available to the Company for constructing an office building and associated parking garage on the property. The City has agreed to transfer two additional parcels of land to SPF15 consisting of approximately .75 acres and SPF15 has agreed to transfer certain parcels of land to the Fishers Town Hall Building Corporation and third parties in connection with the development of the property. Site demolition has commenced, enabling further evaluation of the site for construction of a multi-use development to include the Company's future headquarters.\nDeposits\nThe following table presents the composition of the Company's deposit base as of the end of the last five years.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regular savings accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market accounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>528,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>499,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>341,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,292,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,319,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>964,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>470,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Brokered deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,671,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,084,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,462,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>956,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deposits increased $586.4 million, or 28.1%, to $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2018 as compared to $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2017.

In 2018, brokered certificates of deposit were used as a funding source, as interest rates in the brokered market were, at times during the year, lower than in the institutional and commercial markets in which the Company competes for deposits. During 2018, the Company also began using brokered variable rate money market deposits to supplement organic deposit growth and converted $100.0 million of these deposits to longer-term fixed-rate structures using interest rate swaps to improve asset sensitivity and reduce long-term interest rate risk.

If the Company is unable to secure such capital at favorable terms, its ability to execute its growth strategy could be adversely affected.\nLiquidity management is the process used by the Company to manage the continuing flow of funds necessary to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost while also maintaining safe and sound operations. Liquidity, represented by cash and investment securities, is a product of the Company's operating, investing and financing activities. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, maturing loans and investment securities, access to wholesale funding sources and collateralized borrowings. While scheduled payments and maturities of loans and investment securities are relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows are greatly influenced by interest rates, general economic conditions and competition. Therefore, the Company supplements organic deposit growth and enhances interest rate risk management through brokered deposits and borrowings.\nThe Company maintains cash and investment securities that qualify as liquid assets to maintain adequate liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations and meet its financial commitments. At December 31, 2018, on a consolidated basis, the Company had $670.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available-for-sale, and $18.3 million in loans held-for-sale that were generally available for its cash needs. The Company can also generate funds from wholesale funding sources and collateralized borrowings. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had the ability to borrow an additional $528.3 million in advances from the FHLB and correspondent bank Fed Funds lines of credit.\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its common shareholders and interest and principal on outstanding debt. The Company's primary sources of funds are cash maintained at the holding company level and dividends from the Bank, the payment of which is subject to regulatory limits. At December 31, 2018, the Company, on an unconsolidated basis, had $45.3 million in cash generally available for its cash needs.\nThe Company uses its sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing financial commitments, including withdrawals by depositors, credit commitments to borrowers, operating expenses and capital expenditures. At December 31, 2018, approved outstanding loan commitments, including unused lines of credit, amounted to $223.5 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2018 totaled $762.3 million. Generally, the Company believes that a majority of maturing deposits will remain with the Bank.\nOn December 18, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $10 million of the Company's outstanding common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2019. The stock repurchase program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases, including our capital requirements, the number of shares we expect to issue in the future, economic and market conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and regulatory and legal considerations. There were 10,897 shares repurchased during 2018.\nIn March 2013, the Company borrowed $4.0 million from the Bank for the purchase of the Company's principal executive offices. In February 2017, the Company repaid $0.4 million of the principal balance and amended the loan to reduce the principal amount to $3.6 million and extend the maturity to March 6, 2020. Terms of the loan include a variable rate of interest equal to the then applicable prime rate (as determined by the Bank with reference to the Prime Rate\u201d published in The Wall Street Journal) plus 1.00% per annum and an annual principal repayment of $0.3 million.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis annual report on Form 10-K contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Non-GAAP financial measures, specifically tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible book value per common share, average tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, net interest income - FTE, net interest margin - FTE, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted return on average assets, adjusted return on average shareholders' equity, adjusted return on average tangible common equity, adjusted income tax provision and adjusted effective income tax rate are used by management to measure the strength of the Company's capital and analyze profitability, including its ability to generate earnings on tangible capital invested by its shareholders. Management also believes that it is a standard practice in the banking industry to present net interest margin and net income on a fully-taxable equivalent basis as those measures provide useful information for peer comparisons. Although the Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of its business, they should not be considered a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the following table.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

Estimates\nAllowance for Loan Losses. We believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. An estimate of potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio is determined and an allowance for those losses is established by considering factors including historical loss rates, expected cash flows, and estimated collateral values. The allowance for loan losses represents management's best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is increased by the\nprovision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of recoveries. Management evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly. If the underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate based on subsequent loss evaluations, the allowance for loan losses is adjusted.\nManagement estimates the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses by separately evaluating impaired and non-impaired loans. A specific allowance is assigned to an impaired loan when expected cash flows or collateral do not justify the carrying amount of the loan. The methodology used to assign an allowance to a non-impaired loan is more subjective. Generally, the allowance assigned to non-impaired loans is determined by applying historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics, adjusted for qualitative factors including changes in economic conditions, changes in underwriting standards, and changes in concentrations of credit risk, and changes in industry conditions. Because the economic and business climate in any given industry or market, and its impact on any given borrower, can change rapidly, the risk profile of the loan portfolio is periodically assessed and adjusted when appropriate. Notwithstanding these procedures, there still exists the possibility that the assessment could prove to be significantly incorrect and that an immediate adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would be required.\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities. We classify investments in debt and equity securities as available-for-sale in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 320, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d Securities classified as held-to-maturity would be recorded at cost or amortized cost. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. Fair value calculations are based on quoted market prices when such prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, estimates of fair value are computed using a variety of pricing sources, including Reuters/EJV, Interactive Data and Standard & Poors. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation process, it is possible that the actual fair values of these investments could differ from the estimated amounts, thereby affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If the estimated value of investments is less than the cost or amortized cost, management evaluates whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If such an event or change has occurred and management determines that the impairment is other-than-temporary, a further determination is made as to the portion of impairment that is related to credit loss. The impairment of the investment that is related to the credit loss is expensed in the period in which the event or change occurred. The remainder of the impairment is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nOther Real Estate Owned ( OREO\u201d). OREO acquired through loan foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired, establishing a new cost basis. The adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for loan losses. Due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired, the actual fair value of the OREO or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate. If it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, a valuation adjustment is recorded through noninterest expense. Net operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense. Gains and losses on the disposition of OREO and foreclosed assets are netted and posted through noninterest income.\nImpairment of Goodwill. As a result of the Company's previous acquisition of Landmark Financial Corporation, goodwill, an intangible asset with an indefinite life, is reflected on the balance sheet. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually, unless there are factors present that indicate a potential impairment, in which case, the goodwill impairment test is performed more frequently.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets/Liabilities. Our net deferred income tax asset arises from differences in the dates that items of income and expense enter into our reported income and taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for these items as they arise. From an accounting standpoint, deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine if they are realizable based on the historical level of taxable income, estimates of future taxable income and the reversals of deferred tax liabilities. In most cases, the realization of the deferred tax asset is based on future profitability. If we were to experience net operating losses for tax purposes in a future period, the realization of deferred tax assets would be evaluated for a potential valuation reserve.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 21 to the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into financial transactions to extend credit, interest rate swaps and forms of commitments that may be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. Interest rate swaps are arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and are classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are purchased to convert certain fixed rate assets to floating rate. Cash flow hedges are used to convert certain variable rate liabilities into fixed rate\nliabilities. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $734.1 million and $141.1 million, respectively. Additionally, we enter into forward contracts relating to our mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our mortgage loans held-for-sale. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of $32.5 million and $51.1 million, respectively. These contracts mature in less than one year. Refer to Note 17 to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional information about derivative financial instruments.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and significant commitments as of December 31, 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis includes certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by such forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of this report.\nOverview\nWe offer a wide range of commercial, small business, consumer and municipal banking products and services. We conduct our consumer and small business deposit operations primarily through online channels on a nationwide basis and have no traditional branch offices. Our residential mortgage products are offered nationwide primarily through an online direct-to-consumer platform and are supplemented with Central Indiana-based mortgage and construction lending. Our consumer lending products are primarily originated on a nationwide basis over the Internet as well as through relationships with dealerships and financing partners.\nOur commercial banking products and services are delivered through a relationship banking model and include commercial real estate ( CRE\u201d) banking, commercial and industrial ( C&I\u201d) banking, public finance, healthcare finance and commercial deposits and treasury management. Through our CRE team, we offer single tenant lease financing on a nationwide basis in addition to traditional investor CRE and construction loans primarily within Central Indiana and adjacent markets. To meet the needs of commercial borrowers and depositors located primarily in Central Indiana, Phoenix, Arizona and adjacent markets, our C&I banking team provides credit solutions such as lines of credit, term loans, owner-occupied CRE loans and corporate credit cards. Our public finance team, established in early 2017, provides a range of public and municipal lending and leasing products to government entities on a nationwide basis. Healthcare finance was established in the second quarter of 2017 in conjunction with our strategic partnership with Lendeavor, Inc., a San Francisco-based technology-enabled lender to healthcare practices, and provides lending for healthcare practice finance or acquisition, acquiring or refinancing owner-occupied CRE and equipment purchases. Initial efforts within healthcare finance have primarily focused on the West Coast with plans to expand nationwide. Our commercial deposits and treasury management team works with the other commercial teams to provide deposit products and treasury management services to our commercial and municipal lending customers as well as pursues commercial deposit opportunities in business segments where we have no credit relationships.\nResults of Operations\nRefer to Item 6 of this report for a summary of the Company's financial performance for the five most recent years.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net income was $21.9 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, compared to net income of $15.2 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and net income of $12.1 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe $6.7 million increase in net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was due primarily to an $8.3 million increase in net interest income, a $5.7 million decrease in income tax expense and a $1.0 million decrease in provision for loan losses, but was partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in noninterest expense and a $1.8 million decrease in noninterest income.\nThe increase in net income of $3.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was due primarily to a $14.3 million increase in net interest income, but was partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in noninterest income, a $5.3 million increase in noninterest expense, a $0.5 million increase in provision for loan losses and a $1.8 million increase in income tax expense.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, return on average assets was 0.72%, compared to 0.66% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 0.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, return on average shareholders' equity was 8.44%, compared to 8.54% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 9.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2018, the Company recorded a $2.4 million write-down of a commercial other real estate owned property that consists of two buildings. The revaluation of the other real estate owned was driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the property is located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. As a\nresult, this write-down decreased 2018 net income by $1.9 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.20. Adjusted for the write-down, 2018 net income was $23.8 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.50. The write-down also decreased return on average assets by 6 basis points ( bps\u201d) and return on average shareholders' equity by 74 bps. Adjusted for the write-down, 2018 return on average assets was 0.78% and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.18%. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn 2017, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), the Company's net deferred tax asset ( net DTA\u201d) was revalued as of December 31, 2017. The value of the net DTA was reduced by $1.8 million with the amount of the reduction recognized as additional income tax expense in 2017. Consequently, this revaluation decreased 2017 diluted earnings per share by $0.26. Adjusted for the net DTA revaluation, 2017 net income was $17.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.39. The revaluation also decreased return on average assets by 8 bps and return on average shareholders' equity by 104 bps. Adjusted for the net DTA revaluation, 2017 return on average assets was 0.74% and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.58%. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nConsolidated Average Balance Sheets and Net Interest Income Analyses\nFor the periods presented, the following tables provide the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the related yields and cost of funds. The tables do not reflect any effect of income taxes. Balances are based on the average of daily balances. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances.\n\n1 Yield on total interest-earning assets minus cost of total interest-bearing liabilities\n2 Net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets\n3 On a fully-taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis assuming a 21% tax rate in 2018 and a 35% tax rate in 2017 and 2016. Refer to the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRate/Volume Analysis\nThe following table illustrates the impact of changes in the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and interest rates on net interest income for the periods indicated. The change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.\n\n2018 v. 2017\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $62.3 million, an increase of $8.3 million, or 15.3%, compared to $54.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income was the result of a $30.8 million, or 36.3%, increase in total interest income to $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $84.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in total interest income was partially offset by a $22.5 million, or 73.2%, increase in total interest expense to $53.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $700.3 million, or 41.6%, in the average balance of loans, including loans held-for-sale, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as well as an increase of $36.6 million in the average balance of other earning assets and a 77 basis point (\"bp\") increase in the yield earned on other earning assets. The increase in total interest income was also due to a 19 bp increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio, partially offset by a $10.1 million, or 2.0%, decrease in the average balance of securities and a decline in the yield earned on loans, including loans held-for-sale, of 3 bps.\nThe increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $558.4 million, or 32.6%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of 47 bps in the cost of funds related to these deposits. Interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense, due to a $91.9 million, or 24.4%, increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of 50 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds.\nNet interest margin was 2.09% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 47 bp increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 12 bp increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was due primarily to an increase in average certificates and brokered deposits and money market balances and an increase in the related costs of those deposits. The increase in the cost of these deposits was due primarily to the rise of short-term market interest rates throughout 2018. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the yields earned on securities and other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on loans. The decrease in the yield earned on loans was due primarily to continued strong growth in the public finance portfolio, which typically has lower tax-exempt interest rates, partially offset by higher yields in other commercial loan categories and residential mortgage loans resulting form higher market interest rates.\n2017 v. 2016\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $54.0 million, an increase of $14.3 million, or 36.0%, compared to $39.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income was the result of a $25.8 million, or 43.8%, increase in total interest income to $84.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $58.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in total interest income was partially offset by an $11.5 million, or 59.9%, increase in total interest expense to $30.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $19.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $537.6 million, or 47.0%, in the average balance of loans, including loans held-for-sale, as well as an increase in interest earned on securities resulting from an increase of $115.6 million, or 30.4%, in the average balance of securities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in total interest income was also due to a 17 bp increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio, partially offset by a decline of 10 bps in the yield earned on loans, including loans held-for-sale.\nThe increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $425.6 million, or 33.0%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of 17 bps in the cost of funds related to these deposits. Interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense, due to a $193.1 million, or 105.3%, increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by a decline of 4 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds.\nNet interest margin was 2.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 16 bp increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 6 bp increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in average certificates of deposits, money market balances and other borrowed funds and an increase in the related costs of those deposits. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the yields earned on securities and other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on loans. The decrease in the yield earned on loans was due primarily to strong growth in the public finance portfolio which typically has lower tax-exempt interest rates.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents noninterest income for the five most recent years.\n\n2018 v. 2017\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, noninterest income totaled $8.8 million, representing a decrease of $1.8 million, or 16.9%, compared to $10.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $2.1 million, or 27.0%, in mortgage banking activities, partially offset by gains on sale of loans and other noninterest income. The decrease in revenue from mortgage banking activities was due primarily to decreases in mortgage held-for-sale (\"HFS\") origination and sales volumes, due to a decline in mortgage refinance activity, and a decrease in gain on sale margin.\n2017 v. 2016\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income totaled $10.5 million, representing a decrease of $3.5 million, or 25.1%, compared to $14.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $4.6 million, or 36.8%, in mortgage banking activities, partially offset by gains on sale of loans and other noninterest income. The decrease in revenue from mortgage banking activities was due primarily to decreases in mortgage held-for-sale HFS origination and sales volumes. During 2017, portfolio mortgage originations increased relative to the comparable period in 2016 while mortgage HFS volume declined, contributing to the decline in revenue from mortgage banking activities. The increase in gain on sale of loans was due to the sale of $24.7 million of single tenant lease financing loans, which was the first sale of this loan type in the Company's history. The increase in other noninterest income was due primarily to a $0.4 million increase in income from bank-owned life insurance and a $0.4 million increase in income from subleasing the Company's former corporate office.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the five most recent years.\n\n2018 v. 2017\nNoninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $43.2 million, compared to $36.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $6.5 million, or 17.6%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $2.4 million write-down of other real estate owned, a $2.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $0.8 million increase in premises and equipment expenses and a $0.5 million increase in deposit insurance premium expenses. The write-down of other real estate owned was due to the revaluation of one commercial property, consisting of two buildings, driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the properties are located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to changes in employee mix. Although the number of full-time employees decreased from 2017, recent hires in the Company's commercial lending verticals and support areas were generally in higher skill positions and led to an increase in employee salary and equity compensation expense. Additionally, the Company experienced an increase in benefits expense, primarily related to higher medical, prescription drug and dental insurance claims. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense primarily related to a reduction in senior management incentive compensation due to 2018 financial performance being below the targets established under the Company's Annual Bonus Plan for 2018. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to technology-related expenses and the increase in deposit insurance premium was due primarily to the Company's year-over-year asset growth, which impacts the formula used by the FDIC to calculate deposit insurance.\n2017 v. 2016\nNoninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $36.7 million, compared to $31.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $5.3 million, or 16.8%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to increases of $3.8 million in salaries and employee benefits, $0.6 million in marketing, advertising and promotion expenses, $0.5 million in premises and equipment expenses, $0.5 million in other and $0.3 million in deposit insurance premium expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by merit compensation increases; personnel growth; higher claims experience related to medical, prescription drug and dental insurance; and equity compensation expense. The increase in marketing, advertising and promotion expenses was driven primarily by digital marketing initiatives and higher mortgage lead generation costs. The increase in premises and equipment was due primarily to technology-related expenses. The increase in other was due primarily to repairs and maintenance expenses related to commercial OREO and the increase in deposit insurance premium was due primarily to the Company's year-over-year asset growth, which impacts the formula used by the FDIC to calculate deposit insurance.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory federal tax rate for the five most recent years.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, return on average shareholders' equity was 8.44%, compared to 8.54% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 9.74% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2018, the Company recorded a $2.4 million write-down of a commercial other real estate owned property that consists of two buildings. The revaluation of the other real estate owned was driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the property is located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. As a\nresult, this write-down decreased 2018 net income by $1.9 million and diluted earnings per share by $0.20. Adjusted for the write-down, 2018 net income was $23.8 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.50. The write-down also decreased return on average assets by 6 basis points ( bps\u201d) and return on average shareholders' equity by 74 bps. Adjusted for the write-down, 2018 return on average assets was 0.78% and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.18%. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn 2017, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act\u201d), the Company's net deferred tax asset ( net DTA\u201d) was revalued as of December 31, 2017. The value of the net DTA was reduced by $1.8 million with the amount of the reduction recognized as additional income tax expense in 2017. Consequently, this revaluation decreased 2017 diluted earnings per share by $0.26. Adjusted for the net DTA revaluation, 2017 net income was $17.1 million and diluted earnings per share were $2.39. The revaluation also decreased return on average assets by 8 bps and return on average shareholders' equity by 104 bps. Adjusted for the net DTA revaluation, 2017 return on average assets was 0.74% and return on average shareholders' equity was 9.58%. Refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of Item 7 of Part II of this report, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nConsolidated Average Balance Sheets and Net Interest Income Analyses\nFor the periods presented, the following tables provide the average balances of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the related yields and cost of funds. The tables do not reflect any effect of income taxes. Balances are based on the average of daily balances. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The increase in net interest income was the result of a $30.8 million, or 36.3%, increase in total interest income to $115.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $84.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in total interest income was partially offset by a $22.5 million, or 73.2%, increase in total interest expense to $53.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $30.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in total interest income was due primarily to an increase in interest earned on loans resulting from an increase of $700.3 million, or 41.6%, in the average balance of loans, including loans held-for-sale, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as well as an increase of $36.6 million in the average balance of other earning assets and a 77 basis point (\"bp\") increase in the yield earned on other earning assets. The increase in total interest income was also due to a 19 bp increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio, partially offset by a $10.1 million, or 2.0%, decrease in the average balance of securities and a decline in the yield earned on loans, including loans held-for-sale, of 3 bps.\nThe increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $558.4 million, or 32.6%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of 47 bps in the cost of funds related to these deposits. Interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense, due to a $91.9 million, or 24.4%, increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and an increase of 50 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds.\nNet interest margin was 2.09% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 47 bp increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 12 bp increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was due primarily to an increase in average certificates and brokered deposits and money market balances and an increase in the related costs of those deposits. The increase in the cost of these deposits was due primarily to the rise of short-term market interest rates throughout 2018. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the yields earned on securities and other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on loans. The decrease in the yield earned on loans was due primarily to continued strong growth in the public finance portfolio, which typically has lower tax-exempt interest rates, partially offset by higher yields in other commercial loan categories and residential mortgage loans resulting form higher market interest rates.\n2017 v. 2016\nNet interest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $54.0 million, an increase of $14.3 million, or 36.0%, compared to $39.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.

The increase in total interest income was also due to a 17 bp increase in the yield earned on the securities portfolio, partially offset by a decline of 10 bps in the yield earned on loans, including loans held-for-sale.\nThe increase in total interest expense was driven primarily by an increase in interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits as a result of a $425.6 million, or 33.0%, increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, and an increase of 17 bps in the cost of funds related to these deposits. Interest expense related to other borrowed funds also contributed to the increase in total interest expense, due to a $193.1 million, or 105.3%, increase in the average balance of other borrowed funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, partially offset by a decline of 4 bps in the cost of other borrowed funds.\nNet interest margin was 2.39% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to a 16 bp increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partially offset by a 6 bp increase in the yield on total interest-earning assets. The increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to an increase in average certificates of deposits, money market balances and other borrowed funds and an increase in the related costs of those deposits. The increase in the yield on interest-earning assets was due primarily to increases in the yields earned on securities and other earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on loans.

The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $2.1 million, or 27.0%, in mortgage banking activities, partially offset by gains on sale of loans and other noninterest income. The decrease in revenue from mortgage banking activities was due primarily to decreases in mortgage held-for-sale (\"HFS\") origination and sales volumes, due to a decline in mortgage refinance activity, and a decrease in gain on sale margin.\n2017 v. 2016\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, noninterest income totaled $10.5 million, representing a decrease of $3.5 million, or 25.1%, compared to $14.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily driven by a decrease of $4.6 million, or 36.8%, in mortgage banking activities, partially offset by gains on sale of loans and other noninterest income. The decrease in revenue from mortgage banking activities was due primarily to decreases in mortgage held-for-sale HFS origination and sales volumes. During 2017, portfolio mortgage originations increased relative to the comparable period in 2016 while mortgage HFS volume declined, contributing to the decline in revenue from mortgage banking activities. The increase in gain on sale of loans was due to the sale of $24.7 million of single tenant lease financing loans, which was the first sale of this loan type in the Company's history. The increase in other noninterest income was due primarily to a $0.4 million increase in income from bank-owned life insurance and a $0.4 million increase in income from subleasing the Company's former corporate office.\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following table presents noninterest expense for the five most recent years.\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, advertising and promotion\n</td> <td>2,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting and professional services\n</td> <td>3,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>1,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan expenses\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premises and equipment\n</td> <td>4,996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit insurance premium\n</td> <td>1,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>591\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Write-down of other real estate owned\n</td> <td>2,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 v. 2017\nNoninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $43.2 million, compared to $36.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $6.5 million, or 17.6%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $2.4 million write-down of other real estate owned, a $2.0 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $0.8 million increase in premises and equipment expenses and a $0.5 million increase in deposit insurance premium expenses. The write-down of other real estate owned was due to the revaluation of one commercial property, consisting of two buildings, driven by deteriorating conditions in the market where the properties are located and the commencement of a marketing strategy to move the property off the Company's balance sheet. The increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to changes in employee mix. Although the number of full-time employees decreased from 2017, recent hires in the Company's commercial lending verticals and support areas were generally in higher skill positions and led to an increase in employee salary and equity compensation expense. Additionally, the Company experienced an increase in benefits expense, primarily related to higher medical, prescription drug and dental insurance claims. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense primarily related to a reduction in senior management incentive compensation due to 2018 financial performance being below the targets established under the Company's Annual Bonus Plan for 2018. The increase in premises and equipment was primarily due to technology-related expenses and the increase in deposit insurance premium was due primarily to the Company's year-over-year asset growth, which impacts the formula used by the FDIC to calculate deposit insurance.\n2017 v. 2016\nNoninterest expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $36.7 million, compared to $31.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $5.3 million, or 16.8%, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to increases of $3.8 million in salaries and employee benefits, $0.6 million in marketing, advertising and promotion expenses, $0.5 million in premises and equipment expenses, $0.5 million in other and $0.3 million in deposit insurance premium expenses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven primarily by merit compensation increases; personnel growth; higher claims experience related to medical, prescription drug and dental insurance; and equity compensation expense. The increase in marketing, advertising and promotion expenses was driven primarily by digital marketing initiatives and higher mortgage lead generation costs. The increase in premises and equipment was due primarily to technology-related expenses. The increase in other was due primarily to repairs and maintenance expenses related to commercial OREO and the increase in deposit insurance premium was due primarily to the Company's year-over-year asset growth, which impacts the formula used by the FDIC to calculate deposit insurance.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table reconciles reported income tax expense to that computed at the statutory federal tax rate for the five most recent years.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory rate times pre-tax income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add (subtract) the tax effect of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from tax-exempt securities and loans\n</td> <td>(3,833\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,512\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(635\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(132\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes, net of federal tax effect\n</td> <td>1,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td>"}
