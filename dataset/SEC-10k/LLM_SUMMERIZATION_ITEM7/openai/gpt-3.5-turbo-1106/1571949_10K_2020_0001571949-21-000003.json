MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6. Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2019 compared to 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 6, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of marketplace infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical workflow tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. We report our results in three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.\n\u2022In our Exchanges segment, we operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities. Much of the revenue reported in the Exchanges segment was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment. However, data services revenues and listings revenues, which are now reported in the Exchanges segment, were previously reported in our Data & Listings segment.\n\u2022In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions. Our CDS Clearing and ICE Bonds transaction revenue was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment, while all of our Fixed Income Data & Analytics and Other Data & Network Services revenues were reported in our Data & Listings segment.\n\u2022In our Mortgage Technology segment, we provide an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market. Prior to the re-alignment of our business, ICE Mortgage Technology was reported in our Trading & Clearing segment.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth.\nFrom an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and currently most of our employees are working remotely. In response to government mandates, we closed all of our office facilities between early March and late April 2020, with only our operationally essential employees working on-site at our facilities for business continuity purposes. As various governments began easing orders requiring office closures in late April, we began a phased re-opening of certain of our office facilities allowing a limited number of operationally non-essential workers to also work on-site. These measures are in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. We continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.\nGlobal health concerns relating to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services.\nThe extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend largely on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the distribution, public acceptance and widespread use and effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. We continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by U.S. and other governmental authorities. In light of the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.\nAcquisition of Ellie Mae\nOn September 4, 2020, we acquired Ellie Mae for aggregate consideration of $11.4 billion from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Ellie Mae is a cloud-based technology solution provider for the mortgage finance industry. Through its digital lending platform, Ellie Mae provides technology solutions to participants in the mortgage supply chain, including over\n3,000 customers and thousands of partners and investors who participate on its open network. Originators rely on Ellie Mae to securely manage the exchange of data across the mortgage ecosystem to enable the origination of mortgages while adhering to various local, state and federal compliance requirements. Ellie Mae is a part of our ICE Mortgage Technology business and is included in our Mortgage Technology segment. From the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, Ellie Mae revenues of $351 million and operating expenses of $250 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are reflected in our mortgage technology revenues and operating expenses, respectively.\nThe purchase price consisted of $9.5 billion in cash, as adjusted for $335 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Ellie Mae on the date of acquisition, and approximately $1.9 billion, or approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price on the acquisition date. ICE funded the cash portion of the purchase price with net proceeds from our offering of new senior notes in August 2020, together with the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility.\nAcquisition of Bridge2 Solutions\nOn February 21, 2020, our Bakkt subsidiary acquired Bridge2 Solutions, a leading provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. Bridge2 Solutions enables some of the world's leading brands to engage customers and drive loyalty. It powers incentive and employee perk programs for companies across a wide spectrum of industries.\nBakkt Transaction\nAdditionally, on January 11, 2021, Bakkt, our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, to combine with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, VIH plans to domesticate and become a Delaware corporation (the Domestication\u201d) and be renamed Bakkt Holdings, Inc.\u201d ( Bakkt Pubco\u201d) and, following the Domestication, a subsidiary of VIH plans to merge with and into Bakkt (the Merger\u201d), with Bakkt surviving the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the Closing\u201d), Bakkt Pubco plans to be organized in an Up-C\u201d structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of Bakkt Pubco will be held by Bakkt and its subsidiaries, and Bakkt Pubco's only direct assets will consist of its membership interests in Bakkt. Upon the Closing, Bakkt Pubco is expected to have a class of common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlso on January 11, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, VIH entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors\u201d), pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for additional equity in Bakkt Pubco for an aggregate purchase price equal to $325 million (the PIPE Investment\u201d). The PIPE Investors include ICE, and we committed to purchase additional equity in Bakkt Pubco that would comprise up to $50 million of the PIPE Investment. The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the Closing.\nAs part of the transaction, Bakkt's existing equity holders and management will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company. Assuming no shareholders of VIH exercise their redemption rights, current Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, will own approximately 78% of the combined company, VIH's public shareholders will own approximately 8%, VPC will own 2%, and PIPE investors (a group that will also include us) will own approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company at closing; ICE is expected to have a 65% economic interest in the combined company at the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of VIH's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals. At the Closing, ICE, which is expected to own a majority of the common stock of the Bakkt Pubco immediately following the Merger, will enter into a voting agreement with Bakkt Pubco (the Voting Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, for so long as we own at least 50% of the total voting power of Bakkt Pubco common stock, we will agree to vote on any matter submitted to a vote or consent of the stockholders of Bakkt Pubco any shares of common stock of Bakkt Pubco owned by us in excess of 30% of the outstanding voting power of Bakkt Pubco, in the same percentages, for and against the relevant matter, as votes are cast by all stockholders of Bakkt Pubco other than ICE. As a consequence of the Voting Agreement and Bakkt Pubco's other governance arrangements, following the Closing, we expect to reclassify Bakkt Pubco as our equity method investment and Bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with our financial statements.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial

These adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\u2022Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $834 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues includes $7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.\n\u2022Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $223 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in revenues includes $34 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased $133 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.\n\u2022In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018.\n\u2022The effective tax rate in 2020 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2019.\n\u2022The effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2018 primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS and the divestiture of Trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the TCJA.\nBusiness Environment and Market Trends\nOur business environment has been characterized by:\n\u2022globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;\n\u2022growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;\n\u2022commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;\n\u2022growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;\n\u2022evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;\n\u2022increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;\n\u2022customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;\n\u2022the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;\n\u2022rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and\n\u2022consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.\nRecent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.\nWe have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 48% in 2020. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.\nMany of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:\n\u2022increasing global regulatory demands;\n\u2022greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;\n\u2022greater emphasis on risk management;\n\u2022market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;\n\u2022the move to passive investing and indexation;\n\u2022ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;\n\u2022increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets;\n\u2022the development of new data products;\n\u2022the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;\n\u2022new entrants; and\n\u2022increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.\nWe continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.\nSegment Results\nWe previously operated as two reportable business segments, but effective October 1, 2020, we realigned our businesses as part of a review of, and changes in, our organizational structure following our acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we changed our internal financial reporting and determined that a change in reportable segments had occurred. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:\n\u2022Our Exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and NYSE businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our NYSE listings business. Trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, OTC and other;\n\u2022Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes trade execution and clearing within our ICE Bonds and CDS businesses, pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, consolidated feeds and our ICE Global Network businesses; and\n\u2022Our Mortgage Technology segment includes our MERS, Simplifile and Ellie Mae mortgage services businesses. This segment includes origination technology, network and closing solutions, data and analytics, registrations and other.\nWhile revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our October 1, 2020 change in business segment presentation triggered a reallocation of our segment operating expenses. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nFor details on trends in recent prior year periods, refer to our 2019 and 2018 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.\nExchanges Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.

business.\nExchanges Revenues\nOur Exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and NYSE exchanges as well as data and connectivity services and listings. Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nIn both 2020 and 2019, 14% of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $4 million in 2020 from 2019.\nOur exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $962 million and $855 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to increased volumes in products with higher rates per contract, an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and an increase in the number of participants within our energy futures and options programs.\n\u2022Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume increased 15% and revenues increased 13% in 2020 from 2019.\n-Total oil volume increased 13% in 2020 from 2019 due to increased risk management activity driven by shifting supply/demand dynamics related to various geopolitical events and the emergence of COVID-19.\n-Our global natural gas futures and options volume increased 22% in 2020 from 2019. The volume increase in our North American natural gas products was primarily driven by shifting supply/demand dynamics related to lower levels of U.S. shale production and increased demand for natural gas. In addition, the strength in our European TTF gas volumes was driven by the continued emergence of TTF as not only the European benchmark, but also the emerging global benchmark, for natural gas as the commodity continues to globalize.\n\u2022Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 3% and revenues decreased 2% in 2020 from 2019. The overall decrease in agricultural volumes was primarily driven by lower commodity price volatility than the prior year.\n-Sugar futures and options volumes increased 6% in 2020 from 2019, driven by shifting supply/demand dynamics coupled with increased price volatility.\n-Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume decreased 9% in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to lower cocoa volumes driven by geopolitical uncertainty.\n\u2022Financial Futures and Options: Total volume decreased 2% and revenues increased 8% in our financial futures and options markets in 2020 from 2019.\n-Interest rate futures and options volume and revenue decreased 5% and 1% in 2020 from 2019, respectively, due to the impact of quantitative easing measures implemented by major central banks in response to COVID-19. Interest rate futures and options revenues were $193 million and $196 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n-Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI\u00ae, FTSE\u00ae and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, increased 12% and revenue increased 20% in 2020 from 2019. Other financial futures and options volume increased due to increased equity market volatility driven by accelerating adoption of MSCI\u00ae index futures and options as well as uncertainty related to COVID-19. Other financial futures and options revenues were $164 million and $136 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume increased 42% in 2020 from 2019 due to heightened volatility driven by uncertainty related to COVID-19 and various geopolitical events. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $276 million and $203 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Equity options volume increased 61% in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to higher industry volumes and heightened volatility driven by uncertainty related to COVID-19 and various geopolitical events. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $101 million and $95 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other transaction revenues increased 27% in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to increased income earned on certain clearing margin deposits reflecting higher balances and increased regulatory fees.\n\u2022Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 5% in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers.\n\u2022Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues decreased 1% in 2020 from 2019, driven by market volatility causing IPO delays as well as de-listings, partially offset by a rebound in IPO activity towards the end of 2020.\nListings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges- original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.\nIn addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.\nIn 2020, NYSE and NYSE American raised the most capital globally with approximately $185 billion raised in IPOs and follow-on offerings from over 435 transactions, an increase of 65% from $112 billion raised in 2019.\nSelected Operating Data\nThe following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded,

clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open,\u201d - in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.\nTransaction-Based Expenses\nOur equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of\npayment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $622 million and $379 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $207 million as of December 31, 2020.\nWe make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer's order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.6 billion and $966 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThe following chart summarizes our Exchanges segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2020, our fixed income and data services revenues were higher by $3 million in 2020 than in 2019.\nFixed Income and Data Services Revenues\nOur fixed income and data services revenues increased 3% in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to growth in our fixed income data and analytics products, our other data and network services and strong cleared volumes within our CDS clearing business.\n\u2022Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our fixed income execution revenues decreased 15% in 2020 from 2019. The decrease in revenue was driven by decreased retail activity as a result of low interest rates, particularly municipal and corporate bond activity.\n\u2022CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues decreased 2% in 2020 from 2019. The notional value of CDS cleared was $17.9 trillion and $14.7 trillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Despite record clearing activity in 2020 from both dealers and clients driven by heightened market volatility, revenue decreased as a result of lower interest earned on collateral balances held at the clearing house due to lower 2020 Fed Funds rates.\n\u2022Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 5% in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenue was due to strength in our index business and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products.\n\u2022Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 5% in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues was driven primarily through growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled with strength in our consolidated feeds and stronger desktop revenues.\nAnnual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well as Other Data and Network Services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2020, ASV was $1.569 billion, which increased 6.4% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2019. ASV represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions.\nOperating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThe following chart summarizes our Fixed Income and Data Services segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Our mortgage technology business enables greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating U.S. residential mortgage loans. Mortgage technology revenues increased $456 million or 324% in 2020 from 2019. Revenues from Ellie Mae following our September 2020 acquisition were $351 million and revenues from Simplifile following our June 2019 acquisition were $95 million and $37 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\u2022Origination technology: Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. Revenue from origination technology is based on recurring SaaS subscription fees, with an additive Success-Based Pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription.\n\u2022Network and closing solutions: Our network and closing solutions provide customers connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Our closing network uniquely connects key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the traditionally manual and paper-based closing and recording process. Revenues from network and closing solutions are based largely on the number of applications and closed loans that utilize the various services.\n\u2022Data and Analytics: Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology's AIQ offering, which applies machine learning and artificial intelligence, or AI, to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. AIQ revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of nearly half the U.S. residential mortgage market. We also provide a Data as a Service (DaaS) offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.\n\u2022Registrations and other: Revenues are related to the MERS database, a leading system of record for recording and tracking changes in mortgage servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate; these revenues are transaction-based. Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products.\nThe following chart summarizes our Mortgage Technology segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $2 million higher in 2020 than in 2019. See Item 7(A) - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\u201d below for additional information.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses\nCompensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee headcount </td> <td>8,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee headcount increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to new employees at Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions. These businesses, as well as additional expenses related to Simplifile and growth of our ICE India office, resulted in additional compensation and benefits expense of $113 million in 2020 from 2019. In addition, compensation and benefits expense increased $31 million in 2020 from 2019 as a result of other increases in employee headcount, 2020 merit pay and our 2020 adjustment of our employee cash bonus and non-cash performance-based restricted shares to above-target levels based on our 2020 financial performance metrics. Further, employee taxes and benefits expenses were higher in 2020 primarily due to increased employee insurance costs, partially offset by decreased employee severance expense in 2020 from 2019. The stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards.\nProfessional Services Expenses\nProfessional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business.\nProfessional services expenses increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to increased costs associated with regulatory and litigation matters and $13 million in additional consulting expenses related to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions.\nAcquisition-Related Transaction and Integration Costs\nIn 2020, we incurred $105 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily related to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions. The Bridge2 Solutions acquisition costs include $10 million of expenses resulting from a Bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment that was directly related to the March 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions.\nWe expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.\nTechnology and Communication Expenses\nTechnology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.\nTechnology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we have reflected amounts owed under certain third-party revenue share arrangements as technology and communication operating expenses rather than as had been previously recorded net within transaction and clearing revenues, which resulted in an increase in technology and communications expense of $14 million in 2020 from 2019.\nTechnology and communications expenses also increased by $21 million in 2020 from 2019, due to increased third-party revenue share fees. In addition, technology and communications expenses increased by $43 million in 2020 from 2019 due to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions in 2020 and Simplifile in 2019, partially offset by lower data services costs.\nRent and Occupancy Expenses\nRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York, Pleasanton, London and Hyderabad with smaller offices located throughout the world. Rent and occupancy expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to $6 million related to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions, and $5 million combined costs for the early termination of our NYSE Chicago office lease and costs of our ICE India office. See Item 2 - Properties\u201d above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to a $10 million charitable contribution in support of COVID-19 relief efforts, $8 million in accruals for a regulatory settlement, $6 million in increased costs related to our acquisition of Ellie Mae and increased marketing and bad debt expenses, partially offset by lower travel expenses due to COVID-19.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.\nWe recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $388 million and $311 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, 2019 amortization expense included a $31 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore. Amortization expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to $104 million in amortization expenses recorded on the Ellie Mae intangible assets following our acquisition, partially offset by certain Interactive Data intangible assets that became fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nWe recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $363 million and $320 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2020 over 2019 was primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development and networking equipment and due to $8 million in additional expenses related to our September 2020 acquisition of Ellie Mae. In addition, our 2020 depreciation expense included a software impairment charge of $11 million related to a portion of customized software developed at Bakkt that is no longer useful.\nConsolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions):\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(357) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(285) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(285) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(244) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(267) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(192) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(192) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>203 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to non-controlling interest\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Income\nInterest income decreased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to a decrease in short-term interest rates on various investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the issuance of new senior notes in the May 2020 refinancing and in August 2020 related to the Ellie Mae acquisition. Our fixed rate senior notes outstanding increased by $7.6 billion in 2020 from 2019. In 2020, interest expense included a $14 million extinguishment payment incurred related to the June 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of December 1, 2020 and $5 million in pre-acquisition interest expense related to the Ellie Mae transaction. See - Debt\u201d below.\nOther income (expense), net\nWe have an equity method investment in the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and we recognized $71 million and $62 million in equity income as other income related to this investment during 2020 and 2019, respectively. We own a 40% interest in the OCC, which is regulated by the SEC and the CFTC. Included within the amount recognized during 2019 is a positive earnings adjustment of $19 million to reflect higher reported OCC 2018 net income than originally estimated, due to the SEC's disapproval of the OCC capital plan that was established in 2015. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on our OCC investment.\nIn connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $19 million in 2019, which is included in other income. As a result of a 2020 European regulation limiting dividend payments, we did not receive a Euroclear dividend in 2020. In addition, in November 2020, we became aware of an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar Euroclear investment by a third party. The transaction resulted in a fair value adjustment of our Euroclear investment, and we recorded a gain of $35 million in other income, which includes the impact of foreign currency exchange.\nWe historically held a 9% ownership interest in BIDS, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS Alternative Trading System. In December 2020, we sold our investment in BIDS to Cboe and recorded a gain on the sale of $20 million, included in other income.\nIn 2020, we recorded an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million.\nWe incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $5 million in both 2020 and 2019. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6. Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2019 compared to 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 6, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of marketplace infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical workflow tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. We report our results in three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.\n\u2022In our Exchanges segment, we operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities. Much of the revenue reported in the Exchanges segment was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment. However, data services revenues and listings revenues, which are now reported in the Exchanges segment, were previously reported in our Data & Listings segment.\n\u2022In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions. Our CDS Clearing and ICE Bonds transaction revenue was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment, while all of our Fixed Income Data & Analytics and Other Data & Network Services revenues were reported in our Data & Listings segment.\n\u2022In our Mortgage Technology segment, we provide an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market. Prior to the re-alignment of our business, ICE Mortgage Technology was reported in our Trading & Clearing segment.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth.\nFrom an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and currently most of our employees are working remotely. In response to government mandates, we closed all of our office facilities between early March and late April 2020, with only our operationally essential employees working on-site at our facilities for business continuity purposes. As various governments began easing orders requiring office closures in late April, we began a phased re-opening of certain of our office facilities allowing a limited number of operationally non-essential workers to also work on-site. These measures are in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. We continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.\nGlobal health concerns relating to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services.\nThe extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend largely on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the distribution, public acceptance and widespread use and effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. We continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by U.S. and other governmental authorities. In light of the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.\nAcquisition of Ellie Mae\nOn September 4, 2020, we acquired Ellie Mae for aggregate consideration of $11.4 billion from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Ellie Mae is a cloud-based technology solution provider for the mortgage finance industry. Through its digital lending platform, Ellie Mae provides technology solutions to participants in the mortgage supply chain, including over\n3,000 customers and thousands of partners and investors who participate on its open network. Originators rely on Ellie Mae to securely manage the exchange of data across the mortgage ecosystem to enable the origination of mortgages while adhering to various local, state and federal compliance requirements. Ellie Mae is a part of our ICE Mortgage Technology business and is included in our Mortgage Technology segment. From the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, Ellie Mae revenues of $351 million and operating expenses of $250 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are reflected in our mortgage technology revenues and operating expenses, respectively.\nThe purchase price consisted of $9.5 billion in cash, as adjusted for $335 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Ellie Mae on the date of acquisition, and approximately $1.9 billion, or approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price on the acquisition date. ICE funded the cash portion of the purchase price with net proceeds from our offering of new senior notes in August 2020, together with the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility.\nAcquisition of Bridge2 Solutions\nOn February 21, 2020, our Bakkt subsidiary acquired Bridge2 Solutions, a leading provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. Bridge2 Solutions enables some of the world's leading brands to engage customers and drive loyalty. It powers incentive and employee perk programs for companies across a wide spectrum of industries.\nBakkt Transaction\nAdditionally, on January 11, 2021, Bakkt, our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, to combine with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, VIH plans to domesticate and become a Delaware corporation (the Domestication\u201d) and be renamed Bakkt Holdings, Inc.\u201d ( Bakkt Pubco\u201d) and, following the Domestication, a subsidiary of VIH plans to merge with and into Bakkt (the Merger\u201d), with Bakkt surviving the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the Closing\u201d), Bakkt Pubco plans to be organized in an Up-C\u201d structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of Bakkt Pubco will be held by Bakkt and its subsidiaries, and Bakkt Pubco's only direct assets will consist of its membership interests in Bakkt. Upon the Closing, Bakkt Pubco is expected to have a class of common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlso on January 11, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, VIH entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors\u201d), pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for additional equity in Bakkt Pubco for an aggregate purchase price equal to $325 million (the PIPE Investment\u201d). The PIPE Investors include ICE, and we committed to purchase additional equity in Bakkt Pubco that would comprise up to $50 million of the PIPE Investment. The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the Closing.\nAs part of the transaction, Bakkt's existing equity holders and management will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company. Assuming no shareholders of VIH exercise their redemption rights, current Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, will own approximately 78% of the combined company, VIH's public shareholders will own approximately 8%, VPC will own 2%, and PIPE investors (a group that will also include us) will own approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company at closing; ICE is expected to have a 65% economic interest in the combined company at the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of VIH's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals. At the Closing, ICE, which is expected to own a majority of the common stock of the Bakkt Pubco immediately following the Merger, will enter into a voting agreement with Bakkt Pubco (the Voting Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, for so long as we own at least 50% of the total voting power of Bakkt Pubco common stock, we will agree to vote on any matter submitted to a vote or consent of the stockholders of Bakkt Pubco any shares of common stock of Bakkt Pubco owned by us in excess of 30% of the outstanding voting power of Bakkt Pubco, in the same percentages, for and against the relevant matter, as votes are cast by all stockholders of Bakkt Pubco other than ICE. As a consequence of the Voting Agreement and Bakkt Pubco's other governance arrangements, following the Closing, we expect to reclassify Bakkt Pubco as our equity method investment and Bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with our financial statements.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):\n\n \n(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders are presented net of taxes. These adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\u2022Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $834 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues includes $7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.\n\u2022Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $223 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in revenues includes $34 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased $133 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.\n\u2022In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018.\n\u2022The effective tax rate in 2020 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2019.\n\u2022The effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2018 primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS and the divestiture of Trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the TCJA.\nBusiness Environment and Market Trends\nOur business environment has been characterized by:\n\u2022globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;\n\u2022growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;\n\u2022commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;\n\u2022growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;\n\u2022evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;\n\u2022increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;\n\u2022customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;\n\u2022the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;\n\u2022rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and\n\u2022consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.\nRecent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.\nWe have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 48% in 2020. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.\nMany of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:\n\u2022increasing global regulatory demands;\n\u2022greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;\n\u2022greater emphasis on risk management;\n\u2022market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;\n\u2022the move to passive investing and indexation;\n\u2022ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;\n\u2022increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets;\n\u2022the development of new data products;\n\u2022the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;\n\u2022new entrants; and\n\u2022increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.\nWe continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.\nSegment Results\nWe previously operated as two reportable business segments, but effective October 1, 2020, we realigned our businesses as part of a review of, and changes in, our organizational structure following our acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we changed our internal financial reporting and determined that a change in reportable segments had occurred. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:\n\u2022Our Exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and NYSE businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our NYSE listings business. Trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, OTC and other;\n\u2022Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes trade execution and clearing within our ICE Bonds and CDS businesses, pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, consolidated feeds and our ICE Global Network businesses; and\n\u2022Our Mortgage Technology segment includes our MERS, Simplifile and Ellie Mae mortgage services businesses. This segment includes origination technology, network and closing solutions, data and analytics, registrations and other.\nWhile revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our October 1, 2020 change in business segment presentation triggered a reallocation of our segment operating expenses. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nFor details on trends in recent prior year periods, refer to our 2019 and 2018 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.\nExchanges Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\n(1)Transaction-based expenses are largely attributable to our cash equities and options business.\nExchanges Revenues\nOur Exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and NYSE exchanges as well as data and connectivity services and listings. Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nIn both 2020 and 2019, 14% of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading Forward Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading Risk Factors.\u201d The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6. Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for 2019 compared to 2018 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 6, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a provider of marketplace infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical workflow tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. We report our results in three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.\n\u2022In our Exchanges segment, we operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities. Much of the revenue reported in the Exchanges segment was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment. However, data services revenues and listings revenues, which are now reported in the Exchanges segment, were previously reported in our Data & Listings segment.\n\u2022In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions. Our CDS Clearing and ICE Bonds transaction revenue was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment, while all of our Fixed Income Data & Analytics and Other Data & Network Services revenues were reported in our Data & Listings segment.\n\u2022In our Mortgage Technology segment, we provide an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market. Prior to the re-alignment of our business, ICE Mortgage Technology was reported in our Trading & Clearing segment.\nRecent Developments\nCOVID-19\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth.\nFrom an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and currently most of our employees are working remotely. In response to government mandates, we closed all of our office facilities between early March and late April 2020, with only our operationally essential employees working on-site at our facilities for business continuity purposes. As various governments began easing orders requiring office closures in late April, we began a phased re-opening of certain of our office facilities allowing a limited number of operationally non-essential workers to also work on-site. These measures are in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. We continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.\nGlobal health concerns relating to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services.\nThe extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend largely on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the distribution, public acceptance and widespread use and effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. We continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by U.S. and other governmental authorities. In light of the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.\nAcquisition of Ellie Mae\nOn September 4, 2020, we acquired Ellie Mae for aggregate consideration of $11.4 billion from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Ellie Mae is a cloud-based technology solution provider for the mortgage finance industry. Through its digital lending platform, Ellie Mae provides technology solutions to participants in the mortgage supply chain, including over\n3,000 customers and thousands of partners and investors who participate on its open network. Originators rely on Ellie Mae to securely manage the exchange of data across the mortgage ecosystem to enable the origination of mortgages while adhering to various local, state and federal compliance requirements. Ellie Mae is a part of our ICE Mortgage Technology business and is included in our Mortgage Technology segment. From the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, Ellie Mae revenues of $351 million and operating expenses of $250 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are reflected in our mortgage technology revenues and operating expenses, respectively.\nThe purchase price consisted of $9.5 billion in cash, as adjusted for $335 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Ellie Mae on the date of acquisition, and approximately $1.9 billion, or approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price on the acquisition date. ICE funded the cash portion of the purchase price with net proceeds from our offering of new senior notes in August 2020, together with the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility.\nAcquisition of Bridge2 Solutions\nOn February 21, 2020, our Bakkt subsidiary acquired Bridge2 Solutions, a leading provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. Bridge2 Solutions enables some of the world's leading brands to engage customers and drive loyalty. It powers incentive and employee perk programs for companies across a wide spectrum of industries.\nBakkt Transaction\nAdditionally, on January 11, 2021, Bakkt, our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, to combine with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, VIH plans to domesticate and become a Delaware corporation (the Domestication\u201d) and be renamed Bakkt Holdings, Inc.\u201d ( Bakkt Pubco\u201d) and, following the Domestication, a subsidiary of VIH plans to merge with and into Bakkt (the Merger\u201d), with Bakkt surviving the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the Closing\u201d), Bakkt Pubco plans to be organized in an Up-C\u201d structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of Bakkt Pubco will be held by Bakkt and its subsidiaries, and Bakkt Pubco's only direct assets will consist of its membership interests in Bakkt. Upon the Closing, Bakkt Pubco is expected to have a class of common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlso on January 11, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, VIH entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (collectively, the PIPE Investors\u201d), pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for additional equity in Bakkt Pubco for an aggregate purchase price equal to $325 million (the PIPE Investment\u201d). The PIPE Investors include ICE, and we committed to purchase additional equity in Bakkt Pubco that would comprise up to $50 million of the PIPE Investment. The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the Closing.\nAs part of the transaction, Bakkt's existing equity holders and management will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company. Assuming no shareholders of VIH exercise their redemption rights, current Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, will own approximately 78% of the combined company, VIH's public shareholders will own approximately 8%, VPC will own 2%, and PIPE investors (a group that will also include us) will own approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company at closing; ICE is expected to have a 65% economic interest in the combined company at the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of VIH's shareholders and certain regulatory approvals. At the Closing, ICE, which is expected to own a majority of the common stock of the Bakkt Pubco immediately following the Merger, will enter into a voting agreement with Bakkt Pubco (the Voting Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, for so long as we own at least 50% of the total voting power of Bakkt Pubco common stock, we will agree to vote on any matter submitted to a vote or consent of the stockholders of Bakkt Pubco any shares of common stock of Bakkt Pubco owned by us in excess of 30% of the outstanding voting power of Bakkt Pubco, in the same percentages, for and against the relevant matter, as votes are cast by all stockholders of Bakkt Pubco other than ICE. As a consequence of the Voting Agreement and Bakkt Pubco's other governance arrangements, following the Closing, we expect to reclassify Bakkt Pubco as our equity method investment and Bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with our financial statements.\nConsolidated Financial Highlights\nThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial

These adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. See - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\n\u2022Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $834 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues includes $7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.\n\u2022Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $223 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in revenues includes $34 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased $133 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.\n\u2022In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018.\n\u2022The effective tax rate in 2020 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2019.\n\u2022The effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2018 primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS and the divestiture of Trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the TCJA.\nBusiness Environment and Market Trends\nOur business environment has been characterized by:\n\u2022globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;\n\u2022growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation;\n\u2022commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;\n\u2022growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;\n\u2022evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;\n\u2022increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;\n\u2022customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;\n\u2022the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;\n\u2022rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and\n\u2022consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.\nRecent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 - Business - Regulation\u201d included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.\nWe have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 48% in 2020. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.\nMany of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients' business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following:\n\u2022increasing global regulatory demands;\n\u2022greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations;\n\u2022greater emphasis on risk management;\n\u2022market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes;\n\u2022the move to passive investing and indexation;\n\u2022ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets;\n\u2022increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets;\n\u2022the development of new data products;\n\u2022the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity;\n\u2022new entrants; and\n\u2022increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.\nWe continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.\nSegment Results\nWe previously operated as two reportable business segments, but effective October 1, 2020, we realigned our businesses as part of a review of, and changes in, our organizational structure following our acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we changed our internal financial reporting and determined that a change in reportable segments had occurred. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following:\n\u2022Our Exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and NYSE businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our NYSE listings business. Trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, OTC and other;\n\u2022Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes trade execution and clearing within our ICE Bonds and CDS businesses, pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, consolidated feeds and our ICE Global Network businesses; and\n\u2022Our Mortgage Technology segment includes our MERS, Simplifile and Ellie Mae mortgage services businesses. This segment includes origination technology, network and closing solutions, data and analytics, registrations and other.\nWhile revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our October 1, 2020 change in business segment presentation triggered a reallocation of our segment operating expenses. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.\nFor details on trends in recent prior year periods, refer to our 2019 and 2018 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.\nExchanges Segment\nThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):\n(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance.

business.\nExchanges Revenues\nOur Exchanges segment includes transaction and clearing revenues from our futures and NYSE exchanges as well as data and connectivity services and listings. Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.\nIn both 2020 and 2019, 14% of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros.
