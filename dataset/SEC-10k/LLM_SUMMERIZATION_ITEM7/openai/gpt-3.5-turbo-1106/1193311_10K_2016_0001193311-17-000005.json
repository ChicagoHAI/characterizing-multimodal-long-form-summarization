Revenues from REP subsidiaries of Vistra (formerly subsidiaries of TCEH) represented 23%, 25% and 25% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Oncor Holdings, which is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of EFIH, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of EFH Corp. Oncor Holdings owns 80.03% of our outstanding membership interests, Texas Transmission owns 19.75% of our outstanding membership interests and certain members of our management team and board of directors indirectly own the remaining 0.22% of the outstanding membership interests through Investment LLC. We are managed as an integrated business; consequently, there are no separate reportable business segments.\n\ufeff\nVarious ring-fencing\u201d measures have been taken to enhance the separateness between the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities and the Texas Holdings Group and our credit quality. These measures serve to mitigate our and Oncor Holdings' credit exposure to the Texas Holdings Group and to reduce the risk that our assets and liabilities or those of Oncor Holdings would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the Texas Holdings Group in connection with a bankruptcy of one or more of those entities, including the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings discussed below. Such measures include, among other things: our sale of a 19.75% equity interest to Texas Transmission in November 2008; maintenance of separate books and records for the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities; our board of directors being comprised of a majority of independent directors; and prohibitions on the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities providing credit support to, or receiving credit support from, any member of the Texas Holdings Group. The assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are separate and distinct from those of the Texas Holdings Group. None of the assets of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are available to satisfy the debt or contractual obligations of any member of the Texas Holdings Group. We do not bear any liability for debt or contractual obligations of the Texas Holdings Group, and vice versa. Accordingly, our operations are conducted, and our cash flows are managed, independently from the Texas Holdings Group.\n\ufeff\nSignificant Activities and Events\n\ufeff\nEFH Bankruptcy Proceedings - On the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time, including EFIH, EFCH and TCEH, commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are not parties to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. We believe the ring-fencing\u201d measures discussed above mitigate our potential exposure to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. See Business and Properties-EFH Corp. Bankruptcy Proceedings\u201d and Note 2 to Financial Statements for a discussion of the potential impacts of the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings on our financial statements, a discussion of the proposed change in ownership of Oncor in connection with such proceedings, and a discussion of the Vistra Spin-Off. As a result of the Vistra Spin-Off, Vistra and its subsidiaries, including Luminant and TXU Energy, ceased to be affiliates of ours as of October 3, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Code automatically enjoined, or stayed, us from judicial or administrative proceedings or filing of other actions against our affiliates or their property to recover, collect or secure our claims arising prior to the EFH Petition Date. Following the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. received approval from the bankruptcy court to pay or otherwise honor certain prepetition obligations generally designed to stabilize its operations. Included in the approval were the obligations owed to us representing our prepetition electricity delivery fees. As of December 31, 2016, we had collected our prepetition receivables from the Texas Holdings Group of approximately $129 million.\n\ufeff\nThe EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings are a complex litigation matter and the full extent of potential exposure at this time is unknown. We will continue to evaluate our affiliate transactions and contingencies throughout the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings to determine any risks and resulting impacts on our results of operations, financial statements and cash flows.\nSee Notes 2 and 8 to Financial Statements and Item 7. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information.\n\ufeff\nDebt-Related Activities - See Note 7 to Financial Statements for information regarding repayments of long-term debt and the issuance of $175 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in August 2016.\n\ufeff\nMatters with the PUCT - See discussion of these matters below under Regulation and Rates.\u201d\n\ufeff\nKEY RISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\ufeff\nFollowing is a discussion of key risks and challenges facing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. For additional information concerning risk factors related to our business, see Item1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\n\ufeff\nRates and Cost Recovery\n\ufeff\nOur rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Our rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that our rates are based upon, that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of our costs or that our authorized return on equity will not be reduced. See Regulation and Rates\u201d below for further information, including a discussion of our 2008 rate review.\n\ufeff\nEFH Bankruptcy Proceedings\nOn the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time, including EFIH, EFCH and TCEH, commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are not parties to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. See Significant Activities and Events\u201d above, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Notes 2, 8 and 12 to Financial Statements for a discussion of risks relating to, and potential impacts of, the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nCapital Availability and Cost\n\ufeff\nOur access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. Our credit ratings are currently substantially higher than those of the Texas Holdings Group. If credit rating agencies were to change their views of our independence from any member of the Texas Holdings Group, our credit ratings would likely decline. We believe this risk is substantially mitigated by the ring-fencing measures as described in Note 1 to Financial Statements. It is unclear how the progress of the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings and the consummation of the EFH Acquisition and change in ownership of Oncor proposed in such proceedings may affect our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Adverse actions with respect to our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital, and In the future, we could have liquidity needs that could be difficult to satisfy under some circumstances, especially in uncertain financial market conditions.\u201d\n\ufeff\nTechnology Initiatives\n\ufeff\nRisks to our technology initiative programs include nonperformance by equipment and service providers, failure of the technology to meet performance expectations and inadequate cost recovery allowances by regulatory authorities. We continue to implement measures to mitigate these risks, but there can be no assurance that these technology initiatives will achieve the operational and financial objectives.\n\ufeff\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Protection Risk\n\ufeff\nA breach of our cyber/data or physical security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure or transmission and distribution infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations, affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution system, expose us to material regulatory claims and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a cyber/data breach could also materially affect our reputation, expose the company to legal claims or impair our ability to execute on business strategies. We participate in industry groups and with regulators to remain current on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. While we have not experienced any security breach with a significant operational, reputational or financial impact, we recognize the growing threat within our industry and are proactively taking steps to continuously improve our technology, security measures, processes and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber.\n\ufeff\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\ufeff\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Financial Statements. We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Application of these accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses during the periods covered. The following is a summary of certain critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments and uncertainties and under which different amounts might be reported using different assumptions or estimation methodologies.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for the Effects of Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur tax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings and EFH Corp. was amended in November 2008 to include Texas Transmission and Investment LLC. The tax sharing agreement provides for the calculation of amounts related to income taxes for each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor substantially as if these entities were taxed as corporations and requires payments to the members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by a subsidiary of Oncor Holdings).\n\ufeff\nWe became a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes effective with the equity sale to Texas Transmission and Investment LLC in November 2008. Accordingly, while partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the tax sharing agreement and the presentation of our financial statements as an entity subject to cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes, with such costs historically including income taxes, the financial statements present amounts determined under the tax sharing agreement as provision in lieu of income taxes\u201d and liability in lieu of deferred income taxes\u201d for periods subsequent to the equity sale. Such amounts are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance for income taxes and accounting standards that provide interpretive guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions and thus differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities are accounted for as if we were a stand-alone corporation. In the event such amounts are not paid under the tax sharing agreement, it is probable that this regulatory liability will continue to be included in Oncor's rate setting processes.\n\ufeff\nOur expense amounts related to income taxes and related balance sheet amounts are recorded pursuant to our tax sharing agreement as discussed above. Recording of such amounts involves significant management estimates and judgments, including judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of assets related to income taxes, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual amounts related to income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Our and EFH Corp.'s income tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, the liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future amounts that may be owed as a result of any examination.\n\ufeff\nAmounts payable to and receivable from members related to income taxes on our balance sheet reflect our tax provision net of quarterly estimated tax payments required by the tax sharing agreement that are trued up the following year when the annual tax return is filed. The $80 million and $136 million amounts receivable from members related to income taxes at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are primarily the result of the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The bill was enacted late in December 2015 and allows for 50% bonus depreciation on certain assets placed into service in 2016 and 2015.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to Financial Statements.\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\ufeff\nOncor is subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 5 to Financial Statements for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\ufeff\nWe believe our regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of recovery from or refund to customers based on PURA and/or the PUCT's orders, precedents or substantive rules. Amounts are subject to PUCT review for reasonableness and prudence and possible disallowance.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually (at December 1) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIf at the assessment date our carrying value exceeds our estimated fair value (enterprise value), then the estimated enterprise value is compared to the estimated fair values of our operating assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities at the assessment date. The resultant implied goodwill amount is compared to the recorded goodwill amount. Any excess of the recorded goodwill amount over the implied goodwill amount is written off as an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2016, 2015 and 2014, we concluded, based on a qualitative assessment, that our estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our carrying value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairments were recognized in 2016, 2015 or 2014.\n\ufeff\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and OPEB Plan\n\ufeff\nWe offer certain pension, health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Until July 1, 2014, we participated with EFH Corp. and other subsidiaries of EFH Corp. to offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees (EFH OPEB Plan). Effective July 1, 2014, we ceased participation in the EFH OPEB Plan and established our own OPEB plan for our eligible retirees, certain eligible retirees of EFH Corp. for whom we have OPEB liability with respect to their regulated service, and their eligible dependents (Oncor OPEB Plan). This move to the Oncor OPEB Plan has not had, and is not expected to have a material effect on our net assets or cash flows. Reported costs of providing noncontributory pension and OPEB benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates.\n\ufeff\nPURA provides for our recovery of pension and OPEB costs applicable to services of covered current and former employees, as well as services of other covered current and former employees of EFH Corp./Vistra prior to the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp.'s electric utility businesses effective January 1, 2002 (recoverable service). Accordingly, we entered into an agreement with EFH Corp. (subsequently assigned to Vistra) whereby we assumed responsibility for applicable pension and OPEB costs related to those personnel's recoverable service.\n\ufeff\nWe are authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs reflected in our PUCT-approved billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Accordingly, we recognize (principally as a regulatory asset or property) additional pension and OPEB costs consistent with PURA. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval.\n\ufeff\nWe have also assumed primary responsibility for pension benefits of a closed group of retired and terminated vested plan participants not related to our regulated utility business (non-recoverable service) in a 2012 transaction. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service is not recoverable through rates. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service are recognized in other deductions or comprehensive income.\n\ufeff\nBenefit costs are impacted by actual and actuarial estimates of employee demographics (including but not limited to age, compensation levels and years of accredited service), future health care costs, the level of contributions made to retiree plans, expected and actual earnings on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on current economic conditions and trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future benefit costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2016, the pension plan projected benefit obligation included a net actuarial loss of $106 million due primarily to changes in two key assumptions. Pension plans losses were primarily impacted by a decrease in the discount rate to 4.05% from 4.30%, partially offset by the adoption of a new mortality assumption that shortens expected life spans. Actual returns on pension plan assets in 2016 were more than the expected return on assets by $66 million creating an offsetting actuarial gain. We expect the pension plans estimated amortizations of net actuarial losses to increase by $5 million in 2017 reflecting these changes.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2015, the pension plan projected benefit obligation included an actuarial gain of $181 million due primarily to changes in two key assumptions. Pension plans gains were primarily impacted by an increase in the discount rate to 4.30% from 3.96% and the adoption of a new mortality assumption that shortens expected life spans. Actual returns on pension plan assets in 2015 were less than the expected return on assets by $218 million creating an offsetting actuarial loss.\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with accounting rules, changes in benefit obligations associated with factors discussed above may be immediately recognized as a regulatory asset if related to recoverable service or in other comprehensive income and reclassified as a current cost in future years. As such, significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. Net direct and indirect allocated pension and OPEB costs as determined under applicable accounting rules are summarized in the following table:\n\ufeff\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

We account for the difference between transition charge revenue recognized and cost related to the transition bonds as a regulatory asset or liability. The $98 million decrease in charges related to transition bonds corresponds with an offsetting decrease in amortization and interest expense and primarily reflects the maturity of the 2003 Series transition bonds during 2015 and the 2004 Series transition bonds in May 2016. As such, our 2016 transition charge revenue declined to a level sufficient to service the remaining 2004 Bonds and ceased upon recovery of the debt service costs in mid-2016.

The $68 million increase is primarily the result of a $158 million decrease in tax payments, a $44 million decrease in pension funding and a $41 million decrease in storm related repairs, partially offset by a $127 million decrease in transmission and distribution receipts attributable to lower transition bond revenue and mild winter, spring and summer weather, a $25 million increase in prepayments and a $23 million increase in cash purchases of materials and supplies. The decrease in tax payments results from the recoupment of tax overpayments made in the prior period.\n\ufeff\nCash used in financing activities totaled $137 million and $233 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $96 million change primarily reflects a decrease of $598 million of debt repayments, a decrease in distributions to our members of $206 million and a decrease in debt issuance costs of $22 million, partially offset by $550 million in lower debt issuances and a decrease in short-term borrowings of $180 million.

The $85 million increase is primarily the result of a $134 million decrease in federal income tax payments and a $39 million increase in over-collections of wholesale transmission service expense, partially offset by a $29 million increase in vegetation management cash costs, a $20 million impact of returning customer interconnection agreement deposits that were received in the prior period, a $21 million increase in state income tax payments and an $18 million increase in cash payments to third-party transmission providers. The decrease in federal income tax payments is the result of the December 2014 enactment of the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which retroactively reinstated 50% bonus depreciation on certain assets placed into service in 2014 resulting in receivables from our members. We settled the receivables as the 2015 estimated tax payments became due under the Tax Sharing Agreement.\n\ufeff\nCash used in financing activities totaled $233 million and $202 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2015 increase in cash used in financing activity reflected a $500 million cash principal payment due to a Fixed Senior Note maturity in 2015 (see Note 7 to Financial Statements), a $154 million increase in use of cash due to higher distributions paid compared to 2014 (see Note 9 to Financial Statements) and higher debt issuance costs of $7 million, partially offset by a $475 million increase in the source of cash from issuances of long-term debt and a $163 million increase in the source of cash due to an increase in short-term borrowings to support ongoing capital investments.\n\ufeff\nCash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of capital expenditures increased $10 million, or 1% in 2015 compared to 2014. The 2015 higher capital expenditures were used to upgrade the transmission system and associated facilities, to extend the distribution infrastructure and to pursue certain initiatives in infrastructure maintenance and information technology. The increase in capital expenditures was partially offset by $39 million Bondco related funds that became unrestricted in 2015 when the Series 2003-1 bonds matured and are included in the Other caption under investing activities.\nDepreciation and amortization expense reported in the statements of consolidated cash flows was $45 million and $41 million more than the amounts reported in the statements of consolidated income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The differences result from amortization reported in the following different lines items in the statements of consolidated income: regulatory asset amortization (reported in operation and maintenance expense), the accretion of the adjustment (discount) to regulatory assets (reported in other income) and the amortization of debt fair value discount (reported in interest expense and related charges).\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Debt Activity - Repayments of long-term debt in 2016 totaled $41 million representing the final transition bond principal payment at the scheduled maturity date.\nIn August 2016, we completed the sale of $175 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior secured notes maturing in April 2045 (Additional 2045 Notes). The Additional 2045 Notes were an additional issuance of our 3.75% senior secured notes maturing in April 2045, $375 million aggregate principal amount of which were previously issued in March 2015 (2045 Notes). The Additional 2045 Notes were issued as part of the same series as the 2045 Notes. We used the net proceeds of approximately $185 million from the sale of the Additional 2045 Notes to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Additional 2045 Notes and 2045 Notes are secured by the first priority lien and are secured equally and ratably with all of our other secured indebtedness as discussed below.\n\ufeff\nSee Note 7 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding repayments, redemptions and issuances of long-term debt.\n\ufeff\nAvailable Liquidity/Credit Facility - Our primary source of liquidity, aside from operating cash flows, is our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2016, we had a $2.0 billion secured revolving credit facility. In October 2016, we exercised the second of two one-year extensions available to us and extended the term of the revolving credit facility to October 2018. Subject to the limitations described below, available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility totaled $1.204 billion and $1.153 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We may request an increase in our borrowing capacity of $100 million in the aggregate provided certain conditions are met, including lender approval.\n\ufeff\nThe revolving credit facility contains a senior debt-to-capitalization ratio covenant that effectively limits our ability to incur indebtedness in the future. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenant. See Financial Covenants, Credit Rating Provisions and Cross Default Provisions\u201d below for additional information on this covenant and the calculation of this ratio. The revolving credit facility and the senior notes and debentures issued by us are secured by the Deed of Trust, which permits us to secure other indebtedness with the lien of the Deed of Trust up to the aggregate of (i) the amount of available bond credits, and (ii) 85% of the lower of the fair value or cost of certain property additions that have been certified to the Deed of Trust collateral agent. Accordingly, the availability under our revolving credit facility is limited by the amount of available bond credits and any property additions certified to the Deed of Trust collateral agent in connection with the revolving credit facility borrowings. In addition, our outstanding senior notes and debentures are secured by the Deed of Trust. To the extent we continue to issue debt securities secured by the Deed of Trust, those debt securities would also be limited by the amount of available bond credits and any property additions that have been certified to the Deed of Trust collateral agent. At December 31, 2016, the available bond credits totaled $2.625 billion, and the amount of additional potential indebtedness that could be secured by property additions, subject to the completion of a certification process, totaled $1.739 billion. At both December 31, 2016 and March 9, 2017, the available borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility could be fully drawn.\n\ufeff\nUnder the terms of our revolving credit facility, the commitments of the lenders to make loans to us are several and not joint. Accordingly, if any lender fails to make loans to us, our available liquidity could be reduced by an amount up to the aggregate amount of such lender's commitments under the facility. See Note 6 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding the revolving credit facility.\n\ufeff\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $16 million and $25 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Available liquidity (cash and available revolving credit facility capacity) at December 31, 2016 totaled $1.220 billion reflecting an increase of $42 million from December 31, 2015 primarily due to seasonal nature of our cash flow.\n\ufeff\nWe also committed to the PUCT that we would maintain a regulatory capital structure at or below the assumed debt-to-equity ratio established periodically by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes, which is currently set at 60% debt to 40% equity. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our regulatory capitalization ratios were 59.4% debt and 40.6% equity and 59.8%\ndebt and 40.2% equity, respectively. See Note 9 to Financial Statements for discussion of the regulatory capitalization ratio.\n\ufeff\nLiquidity Needs, Including Capital Expenditures - Our board of directors, which annually approves capital expenditure estimates for the following year, has approved capital expenditures totaling $1.5 billion in 2017. Management currently expects to recommend to our board of directors capital expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion in each of the years 2018 through 2021. These capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure.\n\ufeff\nWe expect cash flows from operations, combined with availability under the revolving credit facility, to provide sufficient liquidity to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital spending for at least the next twelve months. We do not anticipate the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings to have a material impact on our liquidity. Should additional liquidity or capital requirements arise, we may need to access capital markets, generate equity capital or preserve equity through reductions or suspension of distributions to members. In addition, we may also consider new debt issuances, repurchases, exchange offers and other transactions in order to refinance or manage our long-term debt. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms or failure of counterparties to perform under credit or other financial agreements, particularly during any uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow the business and would likely increase capital costs that may not be recoverable through rates.\n\ufeff\nDistributions - During 2016, our board of directors declared, and we paid, the following cash distributions to our members:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDeclaration Date\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nPayment Date\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOctober 26, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOctober 27, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>41 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nJuly 27, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nAugust 11, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>68 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nApril 27, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMay 11, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>65 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFebruary 24, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nFebruary 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>56 \t\t\t\t </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nPension and OPEB Plans Funding - Our funding for the pension plans and Oncor OPEB Plan for the calendar year 2017 is expected to total $149 million and $31 million, respectively. Based on the funded status of the pension plans at December 31, 2016, our aggregate pension plans and Oncor OPEB Plan funding is expected to total approximately $739 million in the period 2017 to 2021. In 2016, we made cash contributions to the pension plans and OPEB plans of $4 million and $31 million, respectively. See Note 10 to Financial Statements for additional information regarding pension and OPEB plans.\n\ufeff\nCapitalization - Our capitalization ratios were 41.7% and 42.9% long-term debt, less amounts due currently, to 58.3% and 57.1% membership interests at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\ufeff\nFinancial Covenants, Credit Rating Provisions and Cross Default Provisions - Our revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant that requires maintenance of a consolidated senior debt-to-capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. For purposes of this ratio, debt is calculated as indebtedness defined in the revolving credit facility (principally, the sum of long-term debt, any capital leases, short-term debt and debt due currently in accordance with GAAP). The debt calculation excludes any transition bonds issued by Bondco, but includes any unamortized fair value discount related to Bondco. Capitalization is calculated as membership interests determined in accordance with GAAP plus indebtedness described above. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.47 to 1.00.\n\ufeff\nImpact on Liquidity of Credit Ratings - The rating agencies assign credit ratings to certain of our debt securities. Our access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. In particular, a decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of our revolving credit facility (as discussed below). In the event any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings takes place and causes borrowing costs to increase, we may not be able to recover such increased costs if they exceed our PUCT-approved cost of debt determined in our most recent rate review or subsequent rate reviews.\n\ufeff\nMost of our large suppliers and counterparties require an expected level of creditworthiness in order for them to enter into transactions with us. If our credit ratings decline, the costs to operate our business could increase because counterparties could require the posting of collateral in the form of cash-related instruments, or counterparties could decline to do business with us.\n\ufeff\nIn July 2016, Moody's upgraded our senior secured rating to A3 from Baa1 and changed our outlook to rating under review for further upgrade\u201d from positive\u201d. In August 2016, Fitch changed our outlook to rating watch positive\u201d from stable\u201d and S&P revised its outlook to positive\u201d from developing\u201d. These rating actions followed the July 29, 2016 announcement that NEE and EFH Corp. had entered into the NEE Merger Agreement (see Note 2 to Financial Statements for information regarding the NEE Merger Agreement and the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings).\n\ufeff\nPresented below are the credit ratings assigned for our debt securities at March 9, 2017.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nSenior Secured\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nS&P\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMoody's\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nA3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFitch\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nBBB+\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nAs described in Note 7 to Financial Statements, our long-term debt, excluding any Bondco non-recourse debt, is currently secured pursuant to the Deed of Trust by a first priority lien on certain of our transmission and distribution assets and is considered senior secured debt.\n\ufeff\nA rating reflects only the view of a rating agency, and is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. Ratings can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change.\n\ufeff\nMaterial Credit Rating Covenants - Our revolving credit facility contains terms pursuant to which the interest rates charged under the agreement may be adjusted depending on credit ratings. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at per annum rates equal to, at our option, (i) LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt or (ii) an alternate base rate (the highest of (1) the prime rate of JPMorgan Chase, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) daily one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a spread ranging from 0.00% to 0.75% depending on credit ratings assigned to our senior secured non-credit enhanced long-term debt. Based on the current ratings assigned to our debt securities at March 9, 2017, our borrowings are generally LIBOR-based and will bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.00%. A decline in credit ratings would increase the cost of our revolving credit facility and likely increase the cost of any debt issuances and additional credit facilities.\n\ufeff\nMaterial Cross Default Provisions - Certain financing arrangements contain provisions that may result in an event of default if there was a failure under other financing arrangements to meet payment terms or to observe other covenants that could result in an acceleration of payments due. Such provisions are referred to as cross default\u201d provisions.\n\ufeff\nUnder our revolving credit facility, a default by us or any subsidiary in respect of indebtedness in a principal amount in excess of $100 million or any judgments for the payment of money in excess of $50 million that are not discharged within 60 days may cause the maturity of outstanding balances ($789 million in short-term borrowings and $7 million in letters of credit at December 31, 2016) under that facility to be accelerated. Additionally, under the Deed of Trust, an event of default under either our revolving credit facility or our indentures would permit our lenders and the holders of our senior secured notes to exercise their remedies under the Deed of Trust.\n\ufeff\nLong-Term Contractual Obligations and Commitments - The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2016. See Notes 7 and 8 to Financial Statements for additional disclosures regarding these long-term debt and non-cancelable purchase obligations.\n\ufeff\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nContractual Cash Obligations\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nLess Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nOne to Three Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nThree to Five Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nMore than Five Years\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt -

The current Legislature is in regular session from January 9, 2017 to May 29, 2017. However, at any time the governor of Texas may convene a special session of the Legislature. During any regular or special session bills may be introduced that, if adopted, could materially and adversely affect our business and our business prospects. Various bills related to our business have been proposed in the current legislative session, however, we cannot predict whether any introduced to date are likely to have a substantial impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\ufeff\nMatters with the PUCT\n\ufeff\nChange in Control Review (PUCT Docket No. 45188) - In September 2015, Oncor and the Hunt Investor Group filed in PUCT Docket No. 45188 a joint application with the PUCT seeking certain regulatory approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Sixth Amended Plan of Reorganization. On March 24, 2016, the PUCT issued an order conditionally approving the joint application. On April 18, 2016, the Hunt Investor Group and certain interveners in PUCT Docket No. 45188 filed motions for rehearing and on May 19, 2016, the PUCT denied such motions and the order became\nfinal. The Hunt Investor Group filed a petition with the Travis County District Court on June 17, 2016 seeking review of the order. We cannot predict the results of the review or the ultimate disposition of PUCT Docket No. 45188, particularly in light of the termination of the Sixth Amended Plan of Reorganization and the other pending transactions discussed in Note 2 to Financial Statements. For additional information regarding the Sixth Amended Plan of Reorganization and application for regulatory approval, see Note 2 to Financial Statements and City Rate Reviews\u201d below.\n\ufeff\nChange in Control Review (PUCT Docket No. 46238) - The NEE Merger Agreement contemplates that Oncor and NEE file a joint application with the PUCT seeking certain regulatory approvals with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Amended New Plan. Oncor and NEE filed that joint application in PUCT Docket No. 46238 in October 2016 and a ruling with respect to such application is expected by late April 2017. For additional information regarding the NEE Merger Agreement and Amended New Plan (including its subsequent amendment by the Further Amended New Plan), see Note 2 to Financial Statements.\n\ufeff\nCity Rate Reviews - Oncor received resolutions passed by 58 cities with original jurisdiction over electric utility rates directing Oncor to file rate review proceedings. The resolutions passed required Oncor to file a rate review with each city by September 1, 2016 based on a January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 test year. However, Oncor was subsequently notified by counsel representing these cities that these rate review proceedings had been suspended indefinitely, pending resolution of Oncor ownership issues. The notice provided that if and when the cities desire to proceed with a rate inquiry, cities would notify Oncor in writing and inform Oncor of a precise date of the rate case, which would be at least 120 days from receipt of the communication that lifts the suspension. On November 17, 2016, counsel representing these cities notified Oncor that the cities were lifting that suspension and expect Oncor to make a rate filing to comply with their resolutions on or before March 17, 2017. The notice requires that Oncor's rate filing be based on an historical test year consisting of the most recent period for which data is available.\n\ufeff\n2008 Rate Review (PUCT Docket No. 35717) - In August 2009, the PUCT issued a final order with respect to our June 2008 rate review filing with the PUCT and 204 cities based on a test year ended December 31, 2007 (PUCT Docket No. 35717), and new rates were implemented in September 2009. We and four other parties appealed various portions of the rate review final order to a state district court. In January 2011, the district court signed its judgment reversing the PUCT with respect to two issues: the PUCT's disallowance of certain franchise fees and the PUCT's decision that PURA no longer requires imposition of a rate discount for state colleges and universities. We filed an appeal with the Texas Third Court of Appeals (Austin Court of Appeals) in February 2011 with respect to the issues we appealed to the district court and did not prevail upon, as well as the district court's decision to reverse the PUCT with respect to discounts for state colleges and universities. In early August 2014, the Austin Court of Appeals reversed the district court and affirmed the PUCT with respect to the PUCT's disallowance of certain franchise fees and the PUCT's decision that PURA no longer requires imposition of a rate discount for state colleges and universities. The Austin Court of Appeals also reversed the PUCT and district court's rejection of a proposed consolidated tax savings adjustment arising out of EFH Corp.'s ability to offset our taxable income against losses from other investments and remanded the issue to the PUCT to determine the amount of the consolidated tax savings adjustment. In late August 2014, we filed a motion on rehearing with the Austin Court of Appeals with respect to certain appeal issues on which we were not successful, including the consolidated tax savings adjustment. In December 2014, the Austin Court of Appeals issued its opinion, clarifying that it was rendering judgment on the rate discount for state colleges and universities issue (affirming that PURA no longer requires imposition of the rate discount) rather than remanding it to the PUCT, and dismissing the motions for rehearing regarding the franchise fee issue and the consolidated tax savings adjustment. We filed a petition for review with the Texas Supreme Court in February 2015. The Texas Supreme Court granted the petition for review and heard oral arguments in September 2016. On January 6, 2017, the Texas Supreme Court issued its opinion, unanimously ruling as follows on the three issues before it:\n\ufeff\nTable 60: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nConsolidated tax savings adjustment - The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals and upheld the PUCT's decision not to make a consolidated tax savings adjustment, concluding that the PUCT had properly applied PURA Section 36.060 and that Oncor no longer met the statutory criteria for imposition of such an adjustment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 61: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nState colleges and universities rate discount - The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' and the PUCT's decisions that no such discount was proper, concluding that PURA Section 36.351 requires a discount only for the provision of electric service and that, upon the start of retail competition, electric service is provided to end-use customers by REPs and not TDUs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nTable 62: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMunicipal franchise fees - The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals' and the PUCT's disallowance of\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td>certain franchise fees, ruling that the relevant PURA provision did not limit negotiated franchise fees to a one-time opportunity upon the expiration of a franchise that was in effect on September 1, 1999, but that such renegotiations may take place at any time.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\nThe Texas Supreme Court issued its mandate on February 16, 2017. On February 17, 2017, Oncor filed a tariff modification with the PUCT to immediately remove the state colleges and universities discount rider, and on February 23, 2017, the PUCT opened Docket No. 46884 to consider the remand from the Texas Supreme Court. That docket will consider recovery of municipal franchise fees, as well as a cash working capital issue that Oncor prevailed upon at the Court of Appeals and which was not appealed to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\ufeff\nSummary\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict future regulatory or legislative actions or any changes in economic and securities market conditions.

discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements.\n\ufeff\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in the following discussion and analysis are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\ufeff\nBUSINESS\n\ufeff\nWe are a regulated electricity transmission and distribution company principally engaged in providing delivery services to REPs that sell power in the north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas. Revenues from REP subsidiaries of Vistra (formerly subsidiaries of TCEH) represented 23%, 25% and 25% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Oncor Holdings, which is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of EFIH, a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of EFH Corp. Oncor Holdings owns 80.03% of our outstanding membership interests, Texas Transmission owns 19.75% of our outstanding membership interests and certain members of our management team and board of directors indirectly own the remaining 0.22% of the outstanding membership interests through Investment LLC. We are managed as an integrated business; consequently, there are no separate reportable business segments.\n\ufeff\nVarious ring-fencing\u201d measures have been taken to enhance the separateness between the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities and the Texas Holdings Group and our credit quality. These measures serve to mitigate our and Oncor Holdings' credit exposure to the Texas Holdings Group and to reduce the risk that our assets and liabilities or those of Oncor Holdings would be substantively consolidated with the assets and liabilities of the Texas Holdings Group in connection with a bankruptcy of one or more of those entities, including the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings discussed below. Such measures include, among other things: our sale of a 19.75% equity interest to Texas Transmission in November 2008; maintenance of separate books and records for the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities; our board of directors being comprised of a majority of independent directors; and prohibitions on the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities providing credit support to, or receiving credit support from, any member of the Texas Holdings Group. The assets and liabilities of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are separate and distinct from those of the Texas Holdings Group. None of the assets of the Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are available to satisfy the debt or contractual obligations of any member of the Texas Holdings Group. We do not bear any liability for debt or contractual obligations of the Texas Holdings Group, and vice versa. Accordingly, our operations are conducted, and our cash flows are managed, independently from the Texas Holdings Group.\n\ufeff\nSignificant Activities and Events\n\ufeff\nEFH Bankruptcy Proceedings - On the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time, including EFIH, EFCH and TCEH, commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are not parties to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. We believe the ring-fencing\u201d measures discussed above mitigate our potential exposure to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. See Business and Properties-EFH Corp. Bankruptcy Proceedings\u201d and Note 2 to Financial Statements for a discussion of the potential impacts of the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings on our financial statements, a discussion of the proposed change in ownership of Oncor in connection with such proceedings, and a discussion of the Vistra Spin-Off. As a result of the Vistra Spin-Off, Vistra and its subsidiaries, including Luminant and TXU Energy, ceased to be affiliates of ours as of October 3, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Code automatically enjoined, or stayed, us from judicial or administrative proceedings or filing of other actions against our affiliates or their property to recover, collect or secure our claims arising prior to the EFH Petition Date. Following the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. received approval from the bankruptcy court to pay or otherwise honor certain prepetition obligations generally designed to stabilize its operations. Included in the approval were the obligations owed to us representing our prepetition electricity delivery fees. As of December 31, 2016, we had collected our prepetition receivables from the Texas Holdings Group of approximately $129 million.\n\ufeff\nThe EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings are a complex litigation matter and the full extent of potential exposure at this time is unknown. We will continue to evaluate our affiliate transactions and contingencies throughout the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings to determine any risks and resulting impacts on our results of operations, financial statements and cash flows.\nSee Notes 2 and 8 to Financial Statements and Item 7. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information.\n\ufeff\nDebt-Related Activities - See Note 7 to Financial Statements for information regarding repayments of long-term debt and the issuance of $175 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in August 2016.\n\ufeff\nMatters with the PUCT - See discussion of these matters below under Regulation and Rates.\u201d\n\ufeff\nKEY RISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\ufeff\nFollowing is a discussion of key risks and challenges facing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. For additional information concerning risk factors related to our business, see Item1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\n\ufeff\nRates and Cost Recovery\n\ufeff\nOur rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Our rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that our rates are based upon, that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of our costs or that our authorized return on equity will not be reduced. See Regulation and Rates\u201d below for further information, including a discussion of our 2008 rate review.\n\ufeff\nEFH Bankruptcy Proceedings\nOn the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time, including EFIH, EFCH and TCEH, commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are not parties to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. See Significant Activities and Events\u201d above, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Notes 2, 8 and 12 to Financial Statements for a discussion of risks relating to, and potential impacts of, the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nCapital Availability and Cost\n\ufeff\nOur access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. Our credit ratings are currently substantially higher than those of the Texas Holdings Group. If credit rating agencies were to change their views of our independence from any member of the Texas Holdings Group, our credit ratings would likely decline. We believe this risk is substantially mitigated by the ring-fencing measures as described in Note 1 to Financial Statements. It is unclear how the progress of the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings and the consummation of the EFH Acquisition and change in ownership of Oncor proposed in such proceedings may affect our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Adverse actions with respect to our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital, and In the future, we could have liquidity needs that could be difficult to satisfy under some circumstances, especially in uncertain financial market conditions.\u201d\n\ufeff\nTechnology Initiatives\n\ufeff\nRisks to our technology initiative programs include nonperformance by equipment and service providers, failure of the technology to meet performance expectations and inadequate cost recovery allowances by regulatory authorities. We continue to implement measures to mitigate these risks, but there can be no assurance that these technology initiatives will achieve the operational and financial objectives.\n\ufeff\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Protection Risk\n\ufeff\nA breach of our cyber/data or physical security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure or transmission and distribution infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations, affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution system, expose us to material regulatory claims and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a cyber/data breach could also materially affect our reputation, expose the company to legal claims or impair our ability to execute on business strategies. We participate in industry groups and with regulators to remain current on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. While we have not experienced any security breach with a significant operational, reputational or financial impact, we recognize the growing threat within our industry and are proactively taking steps to continuously improve our technology, security measures, processes and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber.\n\ufeff\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\ufeff\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Financial Statements. We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Application of these accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses during the periods covered. The following is a summary of certain critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments and uncertainties and under which different amounts might be reported using different assumptions or estimation methodologies.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for the Effects of Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur tax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings and EFH Corp. was amended in November 2008 to include Texas Transmission and Investment LLC. The tax sharing agreement provides for the calculation of amounts related to income taxes for each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor substantially as if these entities were taxed as corporations and requires payments to the members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by a subsidiary of Oncor Holdings).\n\ufeff\nWe became a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes effective with the equity sale to Texas Transmission and Investment LLC in November 2008. Accordingly, while partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the tax sharing agreement and the presentation of our financial statements as an entity subject to cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes, with such costs historically including income taxes, the financial statements present amounts determined under the tax sharing agreement as provision in lieu of income taxes\u201d and liability in lieu of deferred income taxes\u201d for periods subsequent to the equity sale. Such amounts are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance for income taxes and accounting standards that provide interpretive guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions and thus differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities are accounted for as if we were a stand-alone corporation. In the event such amounts are not paid under the tax sharing agreement, it is probable that this regulatory liability will continue to be included in Oncor's rate setting processes.\n\ufeff\nOur expense amounts related to income taxes and related balance sheet amounts are recorded pursuant to our tax sharing agreement as discussed above. Recording of such amounts involves significant management estimates and judgments, including judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of assets related to income taxes, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual amounts related to income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Our and EFH Corp.'s income tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, the liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future amounts that may be owed as a result of any examination.\n\ufeff\nAmounts payable to and receivable from members related to income taxes on our balance sheet reflect our tax provision net of quarterly estimated tax payments required by the tax sharing agreement that are trued up the following year when the annual tax return is filed. The $80 million and $136 million amounts receivable from members related to income taxes at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are primarily the result of the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The bill was enacted late in December 2015 and allows for 50% bonus depreciation on certain assets placed into service in 2016 and 2015.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to Financial Statements.\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\ufeff\nOncor is subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 5 to Financial Statements for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\ufeff\nWe believe our regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of recovery from or refund to customers based on PURA and/or the PUCT's orders, precedents or substantive rules. Amounts are subject to PUCT review for reasonableness and prudence and possible disallowance.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually (at December 1) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIf at the assessment date our carrying value exceeds our estimated fair value (enterprise value), then the estimated enterprise value is compared to the estimated fair values of our operating assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities at the assessment date. The resultant implied goodwill amount is compared to the recorded goodwill amount. Any excess of the recorded goodwill amount over the implied goodwill amount is written off as an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2016, 2015 and 2014, we concluded, based on a qualitative assessment, that our estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our carrying value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairments were recognized in 2016, 2015 or 2014.\n\ufeff\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and OPEB Plan\n\ufeff\nWe offer certain pension, health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Until July 1, 2014, we participated with EFH Corp. and other subsidiaries of EFH Corp. to offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees (EFH OPEB Plan). Effective July 1, 2014, we ceased participation in the EFH OPEB Plan and established our own OPEB plan for our eligible retirees, certain eligible retirees of EFH Corp. for whom we have OPEB liability with respect to their regulated service, and their eligible dependents (Oncor OPEB Plan). This move to the Oncor OPEB Plan has not had, and is not expected to have a material effect on our net assets or cash flows. Reported costs of providing noncontributory pension and OPEB benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates.\n\ufeff\nPURA provides for our recovery of pension and OPEB costs applicable to services of covered current and former employees, as well as services of other covered current and former employees of EFH Corp./Vistra prior to the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp.'s electric utility businesses effective January 1, 2002 (recoverable service). Accordingly, we entered into an agreement with EFH Corp. (subsequently assigned to Vistra) whereby we assumed responsibility for applicable pension and OPEB costs related to those personnel's recoverable service.\n\ufeff\nWe are authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs reflected in our PUCT-approved billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Accordingly, we recognize (principally as a regulatory asset or property) additional pension and OPEB costs consistent with PURA. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval.\n\ufeff\nWe have also assumed primary responsibility for pension benefits of a closed group of retired and terminated vested plan participants not related to our regulated utility business (non-recoverable service) in a 2012 transaction. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service is not recoverable through rates. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service are recognized in other deductions or comprehensive income.\n\ufeff\nBenefit costs are impacted by actual and actuarial estimates of employee demographics (including but not limited to age, compensation levels and years of accredited service), future health care costs, the level of contributions made to retiree plans, expected and actual earnings on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on current economic conditions and trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future benefit costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2016, the pension plan projected benefit obligation included a net actuarial loss of $106 million due primarily to changes in two key assumptions. Pension plans losses were primarily impacted by a decrease in the discount rate to 4.05% from 4.30%, partially offset by the adoption of a new mortality assumption that shortens expected life spans. Actual returns on pension plan assets in 2016 were more than the expected return on assets by $66 million creating an offsetting actuarial gain. We expect the pension plans estimated amortizations of net actuarial losses to increase by $5 million in 2017 reflecting these changes.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2015, the pension plan projected benefit obligation included an actuarial gain of $181 million due primarily to changes in two key assumptions. Pension plans gains were primarily impacted by an increase in the discount rate to 4.30% from 3.96% and the adoption of a new mortality assumption that shortens expected life spans. Actual returns on pension plan assets in 2015 were less than the expected return on assets by $218 million creating an offsetting actuarial loss.\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with accounting rules, changes in benefit obligations associated with factors discussed above may be immediately recognized as a regulatory asset if related to recoverable service or in other comprehensive income and reclassified as a current cost in future years. As such, significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. Net direct and indirect allocated pension and OPEB costs as determined under applicable accounting rules are summarized in the following table:\n\ufeff\n\n_____________\n (a) As a result of the transfer of OPEB plan assets and liabilities from the EFH OPEB Plan to the Oncor OPEB Plan effective July 1, 2014, discussed in Note 10 to Financial Statements, the discount rate reflected in OPEB costs for January through June 2014 was 4.98% and for July through December 2014 was 4.39%. \nSensitivity of these costs to changes in key assumptions is as follows:\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\nSee Note 10 to Financial Statements regarding other disclosures related to pension and OPEB plans obligations.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nOperating Data\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n\n________________\n(a) Includes small business, large commercial and industrial and all other non-residential distribution points of delivery.\n(b) SAIDI is the average number of minutes electric service is interrupted per consumer in a year. SAIFI is the average number of electric service interruptions per consumer in a year. CAIDI is the average duration in minutes per electric service interruption in a year.\n(c) A portion of transmission base revenues (TCOS) is recovered from Oncor's distribution customers through the TCRF rate.\n\ufeff\nFinancial Results \u2500 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\ufeff\nTotal operating revenues increased $42 million, or 1%, to $3.920 billion in 2016. Revenue is billed under tariffs approved by the PUCT. The change reflected:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 A Decrease in Distribution Base Revenues - Base rates are set periodically in a rate review docket initiated by either us or the PUCT. The present distribution base rates became effective on January 1, 2012. The $17 million decrease in distribution base rate revenues primarily consisted of an estimated $42 million decrease due to lower consumption driven primarily by milder winter, spring and summer weather, partially offset by an effect of growth in points of delivery of $25 million. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in Transmission Base Revenues - Transmission base revenues (or TCOS revenues) are collected from load serving entities benefitting from our transmission system. REPs serving customers in our service territory are billed through the TCRF mechanism discussed below while other load serving entities are billed directly. In order to reflect changes in our invested transmission capital, PUCT rules allow us to update our TCOS rates by filing up to two interim TCOS rate adjustments in a calendar year. The $59 million increase in transmission base revenues reflects interim rate increases to recover ongoing investment, including a return component, in the transmission system. See TCOS Filings Table below for a listing of Transmission Interim Rate Update Applications impacting revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as filings that will impact revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n\ufeff\nTCOS Filings Table\n\n______________\n* Application pending\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in Reconcilable Rates - The PUCT has designated certain tariffs (TCRF, EECRF surcharge, AMS surcharge and charges related to transition bonds) as reconcilable, which means the differences between amounts billed under these tariffs and the related incurred costs, including a return component where allowed, are deferred as either regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Accordingly, at prescribed intervals, future applicable tariffs are adjusted to either repay regulatory liabilities or collect regulatory assets. While changes in these tariffs affect revenues and the timing of cash flows, they do not impact operating income, except for the AMS return component. See Note 1 to Financial Statements for accounting treatment of reconcilable tariffs. \n\ufeff\n - An Increase in TCRF - TCRF is a distribution rate charged to REPs to recover fees we pay to other transmission service providers under their TCOS rates and the retail portion of our own TCOS rate. PUCT rules allow us to update the TCRF component of our retail delivery rates on March 1 and September 1 each year. The $117 million increase in TCRF revenue reflects the pass through of a $92 million increase in third-party wholesale transmission expense described below and a $25 million increase in our own TCOS rate to recover ongoing investment in our transmission system including a return component. At December 31, 2016, $10 million was deferred as over-recovered wholesale transmission service expense (see Note 5 to Financial Statements). See TCRF Filings Table below for a listing of TCRF filings impacting cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, as well as filings that will impact cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017. \nTCRF Filings Table\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\ufeff\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements.\n\ufeff\nAll dollar amounts in the tables in the following discussion and analysis are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\ufeff\nBUSINESS\n\ufeff\nWe are a regulated electricity transmission and distribution company principally engaged in providing delivery services to REPs that sell power in the north-central, eastern and western parts of Texas.

We believe the ring-fencing\u201d measures discussed above mitigate our potential exposure to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. See Business and Properties-EFH Corp. Bankruptcy Proceedings\u201d and Note 2 to Financial Statements for a discussion of the potential impacts of the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings on our financial statements, a discussion of the proposed change in ownership of Oncor in connection with such proceedings, and a discussion of the Vistra Spin-Off. As a result of the Vistra Spin-Off, Vistra and its subsidiaries, including Luminant and TXU Energy, ceased to be affiliates of ours as of October 3, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Code automatically enjoined, or stayed, us from judicial or administrative proceedings or filing of other actions against our affiliates or their property to recover, collect or secure our claims arising prior to the EFH Petition Date. Following the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. received approval from the bankruptcy court to pay or otherwise honor certain prepetition obligations generally designed to stabilize its operations. Included in the approval were the obligations owed to us representing our prepetition electricity delivery fees. As of December 31, 2016, we had collected our prepetition receivables from the Texas Holdings Group of approximately $129 million.\n\ufeff\nThe EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings are a complex litigation matter and the full extent of potential exposure at this time is unknown. We will continue to evaluate our affiliate transactions and contingencies throughout the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings to determine any risks and resulting impacts on our results of operations, financial statements and cash flows.\nSee Notes 2 and 8 to Financial Statements and Item 7. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information.\n\ufeff\nDebt-Related Activities - See Note 7 to Financial Statements for information regarding repayments of long-term debt and the issuance of $175 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes in August 2016.\n\ufeff\nMatters with the PUCT - See discussion of these matters below under Regulation and Rates.\u201d\n\ufeff\nKEY RISKS AND CHALLENGES\n\ufeff\nFollowing is a discussion of key risks and challenges facing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. For additional information concerning risk factors related to our business, see Item1A. Risk Factors\u201d in this report.\n\ufeff\nRates and Cost Recovery\n\ufeff\nOur rates are regulated by the PUCT and certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight. This regulatory treatment does not provide any assurance as to achievement of earnings levels. Our rates are regulated based on an analysis of our costs and capital structure, as reviewed and approved in a regulatory proceeding. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. However, there is no assurance that the PUCT will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred, that the PUCT will not reduce the amount of invested capital included in the capital structure that our rates are based upon, that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that produce full recovery of our costs or that our authorized return on equity will not be reduced. See Regulation and Rates\u201d below for further information, including a discussion of our 2008 rate review.\n\ufeff\nEFH Bankruptcy Proceedings\nOn the EFH Petition Date, EFH Corp. and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries at the time, including EFIH, EFCH and TCEH, commenced proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Oncor Ring-Fenced Entities are not parties to the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings. See Significant Activities and Events\u201d above, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Notes 2, 8 and 12 to Financial Statements for a discussion of risks relating to, and potential impacts of, the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings.\nCapital Availability and Cost\n\ufeff\nOur access to capital markets and cost of debt could be directly affected by our credit ratings. Any adverse action with respect to our credit ratings could generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease. Our credit ratings are currently substantially higher than those of the Texas Holdings Group. If credit rating agencies were to change their views of our independence from any member of the Texas Holdings Group, our credit ratings would likely decline. We believe this risk is substantially mitigated by the ring-fencing measures as described in Note 1 to Financial Statements. It is unclear how the progress of the EFH Bankruptcy Proceedings and the consummation of the EFH Acquisition and change in ownership of Oncor proposed in such proceedings may affect our credit ratings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Adverse actions with respect to our credit ratings could negatively affect our ability to access capital, and In the future, we could have liquidity needs that could be difficult to satisfy under some circumstances, especially in uncertain financial market conditions.\u201d\n\ufeff\nTechnology Initiatives\n\ufeff\nRisks to our technology initiative programs include nonperformance by equipment and service providers, failure of the technology to meet performance expectations and inadequate cost recovery allowances by regulatory authorities. We continue to implement measures to mitigate these risks, but there can be no assurance that these technology initiatives will achieve the operational and financial objectives.\n\ufeff\nCyber Security and Infrastructure Protection Risk\n\ufeff\nA breach of our cyber/data or physical security measures that impairs our information technology infrastructure or transmission and distribution infrastructure could disrupt normal business operations, affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution system, expose us to material regulatory claims and limit communication with third parties. Any loss of confidential or proprietary data through a cyber/data breach could also materially affect our reputation, expose the company to legal claims or impair our ability to execute on business strategies. We participate in industry groups and with regulators to remain current on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. While we have not experienced any security breach with a significant operational, reputational or financial impact, we recognize the growing threat within our industry and are proactively taking steps to continuously improve our technology, security measures, processes and services to detect, mitigate and protect our assets, both physical and cyber.\n\ufeff\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\ufeff\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to Financial Statements. We follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Application of these accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reporting of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses during the periods covered. The following is a summary of certain critical accounting policies that are impacted by judgments and uncertainties and under which different amounts might be reported using different assumptions or estimation methodologies.\n\ufeff\nAccounting for the Effects of Income Taxes\n\ufeff\nOur tax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings and EFH Corp. was amended in November 2008 to include Texas Transmission and Investment LLC. The tax sharing agreement provides for the calculation of amounts related to income taxes for each of Oncor Holdings and Oncor substantially as if these entities were taxed as corporations and requires payments to the members determined on that basis (without duplication for any income taxes paid by a subsidiary of Oncor Holdings).\n\ufeff\nWe became a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes effective with the equity sale to Texas Transmission and Investment LLC in November 2008. Accordingly, while partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the tax sharing agreement and the presentation of our financial statements as an entity subject to cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes, with such costs historically including income taxes, the financial statements present amounts determined under the tax sharing agreement as provision in lieu of income taxes\u201d and liability in lieu of deferred income taxes\u201d for periods subsequent to the equity sale. Such amounts are determined in accordance with the provisions of the accounting guidance for income taxes and accounting standards that provide interpretive guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions and thus differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities are accounted for as if we were a stand-alone corporation. In the event such amounts are not paid under the tax sharing agreement, it is probable that this regulatory liability will continue to be included in Oncor's rate setting processes.\n\ufeff\nOur expense amounts related to income taxes and related balance sheet amounts are recorded pursuant to our tax sharing agreement as discussed above. Recording of such amounts involves significant management estimates and judgments, including judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of assets related to income taxes, management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income. Actual amounts related to income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, our forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods, as well as final review of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Our and EFH Corp.'s income tax returns are regularly subject to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, the liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions reflects future amounts that may be owed as a result of any examination.\n\ufeff\nAmounts payable to and receivable from members related to income taxes on our balance sheet reflect our tax provision net of quarterly estimated tax payments required by the tax sharing agreement that are trued up the following year when the annual tax return is filed. The $80 million and $136 million amounts receivable from members related to income taxes at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are primarily the result of the enactment of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The bill was enacted late in December 2015 and allows for 50% bonus depreciation on certain assets placed into service in 2016 and 2015.\nSee Notes 1 and 4 to Financial Statements.\n\ufeff\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\ufeff\nOncor is subject to rate regulation which results in the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process. Rate regulation is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate earned on invested capital and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. See Note 5 to Financial Statements for more information regarding regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\ufeff\nWe believe our regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of recovery from or refund to customers based on PURA and/or the PUCT's orders, precedents or substantive rules. Amounts are subject to PUCT review for reasonableness and prudence and possible disallowance.\n\ufeff\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\n\ufeff\nWe evaluate long-lived assets (including intangible assets with finite lives) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\ufeff\nWe also evaluate goodwill for impairment annually (at December 1) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. The determination of the existence of these and other indications of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nIf at the assessment date our carrying value exceeds our estimated fair value (enterprise value), then the estimated enterprise value is compared to the estimated fair values of our operating assets (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities at the assessment date. The resultant implied goodwill amount is compared to the recorded goodwill amount. Any excess of the recorded goodwill amount over the implied goodwill amount is written off as an impairment charge.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2016, 2015 and 2014, we concluded, based on a qualitative assessment, that our estimated enterprise fair value was more likely than not greater than our carrying value. As a result, no additional testing for impairment was required and no impairments were recognized in 2016, 2015 or 2014.\n\ufeff\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans and OPEB Plan\n\ufeff\nWe offer certain pension, health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees. Until July 1, 2014, we participated with EFH Corp. and other subsidiaries of EFH Corp. to offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees (EFH OPEB Plan). Effective July 1, 2014, we ceased participation in the EFH OPEB Plan and established our own OPEB plan for our eligible retirees, certain eligible retirees of EFH Corp. for whom we have OPEB liability with respect to their regulated service, and their eligible dependents (Oncor OPEB Plan). This move to the Oncor OPEB Plan has not had, and is not expected to have a material effect on our net assets or cash flows. Reported costs of providing noncontributory pension and OPEB benefits are dependent upon numerous factors, assumptions and estimates.\n\ufeff\nPURA provides for our recovery of pension and OPEB costs applicable to services of covered current and former employees, as well as services of other covered current and former employees of EFH Corp./Vistra prior to the deregulation and disaggregation of EFH Corp.'s electric utility businesses effective January 1, 2002 (recoverable service). Accordingly, we entered into an agreement with EFH Corp. (subsequently assigned to Vistra) whereby we assumed responsibility for applicable pension and OPEB costs related to those personnel's recoverable service.\n\ufeff\nWe are authorized to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the difference between the amounts of pension and OPEB costs reflected in our PUCT-approved billing rates and the actual amounts that would otherwise have been recorded as charges or credits to earnings related to recoverable service. Accordingly, we recognize (principally as a regulatory asset or property) additional pension and OPEB costs consistent with PURA. Amounts deferred are ultimately subject to regulatory approval.\n\ufeff\nWe have also assumed primary responsibility for pension benefits of a closed group of retired and terminated vested plan participants not related to our regulated utility business (non-recoverable service) in a 2012 transaction. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service is not recoverable through rates. Any retirement costs associated with non-recoverable service are recognized in other deductions or comprehensive income.\n\ufeff\nBenefit costs are impacted by actual and actuarial estimates of employee demographics (including but not limited to age, compensation levels and years of accredited service), future health care costs, the level of contributions made to retiree plans, expected and actual earnings on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on current economic conditions and trends. Changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future benefit costs. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2016, the pension plan projected benefit obligation included a net actuarial loss of $106 million due primarily to changes in two key assumptions. Pension plans losses were primarily impacted by a decrease in the discount rate to 4.05% from 4.30%, partially offset by the adoption of a new mortality assumption that shortens expected life spans. Actual returns on pension plan assets in 2016 were more than the expected return on assets by $66 million creating an offsetting actuarial gain. We expect the pension plans estimated amortizations of net actuarial losses to increase by $5 million in 2017 reflecting these changes.\n\ufeff\nAt December 31, 2015, the pension plan projected benefit obligation included an actuarial gain of $181 million due primarily to changes in two key assumptions. Pension plans gains were primarily impacted by an increase in the discount rate to 4.30% from 3.96% and the adoption of a new mortality assumption that shortens expected life spans. Actual returns on pension plan assets in 2015 were less than the expected return on assets by $218 million creating an offsetting actuarial loss.\n\ufeff\nIn accordance with accounting rules, changes in benefit obligations associated with factors discussed above may be immediately recognized as a regulatory asset if related to recoverable service or in other comprehensive income and reclassified as a current cost in future years. As such, significant portions of benefit costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants. Net direct and indirect allocated pension and OPEB costs as determined under applicable accounting rules are summarized in the following table:\n\ufeff\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Revenue is billed under tariffs approved by the PUCT. The change reflected:\n\ufeff\n \u00b7 A Decrease in Distribution Base Revenues - Base rates are set periodically in a rate review docket initiated by either us or the PUCT. The present distribution base rates became effective on January 1, 2012. The $17 million decrease in distribution base rate revenues primarily consisted of an estimated $42 million decrease due to lower consumption driven primarily by milder winter, spring and summer weather, partially offset by an effect of growth in points of delivery of $25 million. \n\ufeff\n \u00b7 An Increase in Transmission Base Revenues - Transmission base revenues (or TCOS revenues) are collected from load serving entities benefitting from our transmission system. REPs serving customers in our service territory are billed through the TCRF mechanism discussed below while other load serving entities are billed directly. In order to reflect changes in our invested transmission capital, PUCT rules allow us to update our TCOS rates by filing up to two interim TCOS rate adjustments in a calendar year. The $59 million increase in transmission base revenues reflects interim rate increases to recover ongoing investment, including a return component, in the transmission system.

Accordingly, at prescribed intervals, future applicable tariffs are adjusted to either repay regulatory liabilities or collect regulatory assets. While changes in these tariffs affect revenues and the timing of cash flows, they do not impact operating income, except for the AMS return component. See Note 1 to Financial Statements for accounting treatment of reconcilable tariffs. \n\ufeff\n - An Increase in TCRF - TCRF is a distribution rate charged to REPs to recover fees we pay to other transmission service providers under their TCOS rates and the retail portion of our own TCOS rate. PUCT rules allow us to update the TCRF component of our retail delivery rates on March 1 and September 1 each year. The $117 million increase in TCRF revenue reflects the pass through of a $92 million increase in third-party wholesale transmission expense described below and a $25 million increase in our own TCOS rate to recover ongoing investment in our transmission system including a return component. At December 31, 2016, $10 million was deferred as over-recovered wholesale transmission service expense (see Note 5 to Financial Statements).
