Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs a trusted local resource, we deliver significant value to both consumers and businesses by helping each discover and interact with the other. Our unrivaled content helps consumers save time and money. Our advertising and other products help business owners increase their visibility and connect with our large audience of purchase-oriented consumers.\nOur comprehensive, mobile-first platform offers reservation and waitlist, food ordering and quote request capabilities, among many other opportunities for consumers to engage with businesses, in addition to the 189.9 million reviews available as of December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, these features attracted a monthly average audience of nearly 35.6 million app unique devices, allowed over 8.8 million diners to make reservations or join a restaurant waitlist, and facilitated consumer submissions of 2.1 million projects to service providers through Request-A-Quote. In the same period, business owners, in turn, promoted their businesses to our large audience by spending 10% more on our advertising products than in the fourth quarter of 2018, seated more than double the number of diners via Yelp compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and received millions of leads through Request-A-Quote.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising products. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our net revenue was $1.0 billion, which represented an increase of 8% from the year ended December 31, 2018, and we recorded net income of $40.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $213.5 million. In the year ended December 31, 2018, our net revenue was $942.8 million, which represented an increase of 11% from the year ended December 31, 2017, and we recorded net income of $55.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $183.1 million. For information on how we define and calculate adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nFollowing our transition to a multi-channel, on-demand business model, which we completed in 2018 with our move to non-term advertising contracts, we embarked on an ambitious, multi-year business transformation plan designed to drive and sustain profitable long-term growth. As we continue executing on our plan in 2020, we will look to further advance the strategic initiatives we began in 2019:\n\u2022Winning in Key Categories. We made significant accomplishments in 2019 in our key categories of restaurants and home & local services. In restaurants, we more than doubled the number of diners seated via Yelp and increased the combined revenue attributable to Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist by a double-digit percentage compared to 2018, while in home & local services we significantly increased paid leads to advertisers and increased revenue attributable to Request-A-Quote by nearly 60% compared to 2018. We believe these categories continue to present substantial opportunities for revenue growth, and plan to pursue those opportunities in 2020 by increasing monetization of our restaurants offerings through price optimization and cross selling, and increasing the number of paid leads delivered to home & local services advertisers.\n\u2022Expanding Our Product Offerings. Our introduction of a range of paid products at affordable price points over the course of 2019, including our Business Highlights, Portfolios and Yelp Connect products, attracted thousands of new customers and helped accelerate revenue growth in our self-serve channel to 30% in 2019. Matching advertisers to the right products at the right prices will be a top priority for us in 2020, and we plan to introduce additional profile products in 2020 that will help business owners tell their stories and build trust with customers.\n\u2022Providing More Value to Business Owners. In 2019, we delivered significantly more value to our customers - we generated 34% more ad clicks for Yelp advertisers at an average CPC 18% lower than in 2018 - and saw improved retention among non-term advertisers as a result. We accomplished this through improvements to our advertising auction system and ad targeting, as well as by expanding advertising inventory in certain categories such as home & local services. In 2020, we plan to continue generating more value for our business customers through initiatives including further enhancements to our auction system, improvements to our Request-A-Quote lead matching and introducing new types of advertising inventory.\n\u2022Capturing the Multi-location Opportunity. Our multi-location advertising business grew 22% in 2019 from the prior year, and our initiatives to increase our business with the top 250 restaurants and retailers by revenue successfully resulted in a substantial number of such businesses becoming paying customers by the end of the year. We plan to drive continued momentum in our multi-location advertising business in 2020 by growing our multi-location sales team to expand our coverage to the services category, as well as by continuing to integrate product development with sales efforts through the introduction of new ad formats tailored to the needs of multi-location businesses.\n\u2022Enhancing the Consumer Experience. In addition to successfully increasing the number of paid leads we delivered to advertisers while maintaining an engaging experience for consumers, we enhanced the consumer experience through more personalized recommendations, new Yelp Waitlist features and expanded restaurant health inspection scores. An engaged consumer base is at the heart of our value proposition to businesses, and we plan to drive engagement in 2020 through an updated user interface for our mobile app (where we find our most engaged users) that offers improved convenience and ease of use.\n\u2022Improved Profitability. In the first year of our multi-year business transformation plan, we improved the structural economics of our business. Our focus on growth and retention in our highest-margin sales channels allowed us to increase revenue growth without expanding our local sales force; in fact, we reduced local sales headcount by 10% in 2019. We expect these structural improvements to help drive profitable growth again in 2020 as we continue to emphasize our most efficient sales channels as well as work to improve retention, optimize our cost structure and control expenses.\nWe expect to continue to invest in product development, personnel and the facilities to support them in 2020 as we work to grow our business, including investments to increase our office space, upgrade our technology and infrastructure to improve the ability of our platform to handle the projected increase in usage, and enable the release of new products and features. As a result of this investment philosophy, we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Advertisers. Our revenue growth is driven by our ability to attract and retain advertising customers. To do so, we must deliver compelling ad products in an effective manner, at prices that compare favorably to those of our competitors. Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products. A substantial and increasing portion also have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control, including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. Although we have shifted our focus to the opportunity presented by multi-location businesses recently, we continue to rely heavily on SMBs that often have limited advertising budgets and that may view online advertising products like ours as experimental and unproven.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base also depends on the size and productivity of our sales force and customer success team. As we continue to invest in expanding our multi-location sales organization while maintaining a large local sales force, we must efficiently scale our operations while at the same time recruiting, training and integrating new hires and developing, motivating and retaining existing employees. Similarly, in order to retain, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen our relationships with, our existing customers, we must continue our efforts to build out our customer success team. Developing our account retention processes will be particularly important as an increasing portion of our advertisers have the ability to cancel their contracts at any time. In addition, as we make periodic adjustments to our sales organization to respond to market opportunities and to pursue initiatives to increase productivity, such changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or disruption to our operations. For example, it took time for our sales and customer success organizations to adapt to selling and supporting advertising contracts with flexible cancellation terms. Our increased emphasis on our multi-location and self-serve channels involves changes to our sales organization and sales force hiring priorities, which may be disruptive to our sales operations.\nTraffic and User Engagement. We derive substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and traffic to our platform determines the number of ads we are able to show, affects the value of those ads to businesses and influences the content creation that drives further traffic. As a result, our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to increase traffic on our platform, which in turn depends on, among other things, the quality of our content and the prominence of links to our platform in Internet search engine results and application marketplaces. The number of users we attract from search engines in particular can be affected by a number of factors not in our direct control; changes in a search engine's ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts may result in links to our website not being prominent enough to drive traffic to our website and mobile app. In addition, certain providers of Internet search engines and application marketplaces offer products and services that compete\ndirectly with our products and, in some instances, such providers may change their displays or rankings in order to promote their own competing products or services.\nWe anticipate that our traffic growth will continue to slow over time, and potentially decrease in certain periods, as our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates in our core markets of the United States and Canada. As our traffic growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on our platform, which itself depends on the quality of our content and our ability to introduce new and improved products that effectively address consumer needs, among other things.\nProduct Innovation. We must deliver innovative, relevant and useful products to consumers and businesses - including products for mobile and other alternative devices - to expand the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue. We plan to continue investing in new product development as we introduce new advertising and e-commerce products, explore new platforms and distribution channels, and develop partner arrangements that provide incremental value to our users and advertisers to encourage them to increase their usage of, and the portion of their advertising budgets allocated to, our platform. As our industry evolves and competition intensifies, our investments may increasingly include products and services outside of our historical core business, such as our continued development of Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist. These investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as distracting management, and may ultimately fail to generate sufficient revenue or other value to justify our investments in them.\nInvestment in Growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, aggressively to support the growth of our platform. We dedicate significant resources to areas such as: marketing; consumer protection; maintaining and enhancing the Yelp brand; and upgrading our systems, technology and network infrastructure to accommodate growth. Our investment plans for 2020 include developing new advertising products, further developing our analytics tools for advertisers, improving our Request-A-Quote matching capabilities and refining our advertising auction system. While we believe these initiatives will ultimately drive revenue growth, our investments in them will increase our operating expenses, and any increase in revenue resulting from these product innovations will likely trail the increase in expenses.\nStock Repurchases. In July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired 4,896,003 shares and 302,206 shares, respectively, for aggregate purchase prices of $187.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. On each of November 27, 2018 and February 11, 2019, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of our outstanding common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program, of which we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired 14,190,409 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $481.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. On January 15, 2020, our board approved a further increase of $250 million to our stock repurchase program, bringing the total amount of repurchases authorized under our stock repurchase program to $950 million, of which approximately $269 million remains available. We have funded the repurchases, and expect to fund future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet. As a result, this program could diminish our cash reserves and reduce our ability to invest in our business, in addition to affecting the trading price and volatility of our stock.\nCorporate Development Activities. As part of our business strategy, we may decide to expand our product offerings and grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies, as well as through partnerships. In addition to diverting our management's attention and otherwise disrupting our operations, our corporate development activities will affect our future financial results due to factors such as expenses incurred in identifying, investigating and pursuing transactions, whether or not they are consummated, possible dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, unidentified liabilities and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Maintaining relationships with partners also requires significant time and resources, as does integrating their data, services and technologies onto our platform. We may not realize the full benefits of synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from a corporate transaction; similarly, if our relationships with partners deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide consumers and advertisers with our content or services.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality. Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and advertising spending, as well as cyclicality in economic activity. Based on historical trends, we expect traffic numbers to be weakest in the fourth quarter of the year in connection with end of the year holidays. In addition, although our multi-location customers tend to increase spending on advertising in the fourth quarter, the SMBs on which we rely heavily typically decrease their advertising spending during this quarter. SMBs may be disproportionately affected by negative fluctuations in the business cycle, and a worsening economic outlook would likely cause such businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which would adversely affect our revenue. As our business matures and the proportion of our customers who can cancel their ad campaigns at any time\nincreases, we expect that the seasonality and cyclicality in our business may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics set forth below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Unless otherwise stated, these metrics do not include metrics for Yelp Reservations, Yelp Waitlist, Yelp WiFi Marketing, our business owner products or Yelp Eat24, which we sold on October 10, 2017.\nReviews\nNumber of reviews represents the cumulative number of reviews submitted to Yelp since inception, as of the period end, including reviews that were not recommended or had been removed from our platform. In addition to the text of the review, each review includes a rating of one to five stars. We include reviews that are not recommended and that have been removed because all of them are either currently accessible on our platform or were accessible at some point in time, providing information that may be useful to users to evaluate businesses and individual reviewers. Because our automated recommendation software continually reassesses which reviews to recommend based on new information that becomes available, the recommended\u201d or not recommended\u201d status of reviews may change over time. Reviews that are not recommended or that have been removed do not factor into a business's overall star rating. By clicking on a link on a reviewed business's page on our website, users can access the reviews that are not currently recommended for the business, as well as the star rating and other information about reviews that were removed for violation of our terms of service.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 189.9 million reviews were available on business listing pages, including approximately 44.4 million reviews that were not recommended, after 15.5 million reviews had been removed from our platform, either by us for violation of our terms of service or by the users who contributed them. The following table presents the number of cumulative reviews as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reviews </td> <td>205,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTraffic\nTraffic to our website and mobile app has three components: mobile devices accessing our mobile app, visitors to our non-mobile optimized website, which we refer to as our desktop website, and visitors to our mobile-optimized website, which we refer to as our mobile website. App users generate a substantial majority of activity on Yelp, including the page views and ad clicks that we monetize. We anticipate that our mobile traffic will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future and that traffic to our website will fluctuate and generally decline as we focus on driving traffic to our mobile app, where we have our most engaged users and which reduces our reliance on Google and other search engines.\nWe use the metrics set forth below to measure each of our traffic streams. An individual user who accesses our platform through multiple traffic streams will be counted in each applicable traffic metric; as a result, the sum of our traffic metrics will not accurately represent the number of people who visit our platform on an average monthly basis.\nApp Unique Devices. We calculate app unique devices as the number of unique mobile devices using our mobile app in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Under this method of calculation, an individual who accesses our mobile app from multiple mobile devices will be counted as multiple app unique devices. Multiple individuals who access our mobile app from a shared device will be counted as a single app unique device.\nThe following table presents app unique devices for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>App Unique Devices </td> <td>35,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDesktop and Mobile Website Unique Visitors. We calculate desktop unique visitors as the number of users,\u201d as measured by Google Analytics, who have visited our desktop website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Similarly, we calculate mobile website unique visitors as the number of users\u201d who have visited our mobile website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period.\nGoogle Analytics, a product from Google Inc. that provides digital marketing intelligence, measures users\u201d based on unique cookie identifiers. Because the numbers of desktop unique visitors and mobile website unique visitors are therefore based on unique cookies, an individual who accesses our desktop website or mobile website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple desktop unique visitors or mobile website unique visitors, as applicable, and multiple individuals who access our desktop website or mobile website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single desktop unique visitor or mobile website unique visitor.\nThe following table presents our web traffic for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop Unique Visitors </td> <td>54,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,748 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile Web Unique Visitors </td> <td>68,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,221 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have discovered in the past, and expect to discover in the future, that portions of our desktop traffic, as measured by Google Analytics, have been attributable to robots and other invalid sources. Because traffic from such sources does not represent valid consumer traffic, our reported desktop unique visitor metric for impacted periods reflects an adjustment to the Google Analytics measurement of our traffic to remove traffic that we have identified as originating from invalid sources to provide greater accuracy and transparency. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify all such traffic for any particular period. For additional information, please see the risk factor included under Part I, Item 1A under the heading We rely on data from both internal tools and third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nActive Claimed Local Business Locations\nThe number of active claimed local business locations represents the number of claimed local business locations - business addresses for which a business representative has visited our platform and claimed the free business listing page for the business located at that address - that are both (a) active on Yelp and (b) associated with an active business owner account as of a given date. We consider a claimed local business location to be active if it has not closed, been removed from our platform or merged with another claimed local business.\nThe following table presents the number of active claimed locations as of the dates presented (in thousands). The December 31, 2018 and 2017 numbers have been updated to reflect our current methodology for calculating active claimed local business locations.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active Claimed Local Business Locations </td> <td>4,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaying Advertising Locations\nPaying advertising locations comprise all business locations associated with a business account from which we recognized advertising revenue in a given month, excluding business accounts that purchased advertising through partner programs other than Yelp Ads Certified Partners, averaged over a given three-month period. The following table presents the number of paying advertising locations for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paying Advertising Locations </td> <td>565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and internal-use software development costs, the incremental borrowing rate used in adopting the new leasing standard, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on these and our other significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages). The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

recalculate exactly due to rounding.\n(2) Percentage change is not meaningful.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017\nNet Revenue\nAdvertising. We generate advertising revenue from the sale of our advertising products - including enhanced listing pages and performance and impression-based advertising in search results and elsewhere on our platform - to businesses of all sizes, from single-location local businesses to multi-location national businesses. Advertising revenue also includes revenue generated from the resale of our advertising products by certain partners and monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks.\nThe increase in advertising revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to growth in the number of paying advertiser locations, improved local customer retention and increased revenue from existing multi-location customers. The growth in paying advertiser locations on the local business side resulted from stronger sales force productivity. The improvements in retention were driven by delivering more value to local customers through the efficiency of our advertising auction system and our ad targeting. Our new multi-location advertising products and larger multi-location sales force drove the increase in revenue from multi-location customers, particularly from more tenured national customers.\nThe increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a significant increase in the number of paying advertising accounts, which was driven by the sale of non-term contracts and the expansion of our local sales force.\nThe growth in both periods primarily consisted of sales of CPC advertising and a majority of ad clicks were delivered on mobile in both years.\nWe expect our advertising revenue to continue to increase as we pursue initiatives to expand our multi-location business, increase sales force productivity and improve customer retention.\nTransactions. We generate revenue from various transactions with consumers, primarily through transactions placed through our partnership integrations. Our partnership integrations are primarily revenue-sharing arrangements that provide consumers with the ability to complete food ordering and delivery transactions through third parties directly on Yelp. We earn a fee for acting as an agent for transactions placed through these integrations, which we record on a net basis and include in revenue upon completion of a transaction.\nThe decrease in transactions revenue in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a decrease in fees earned from Grubhub for processing credit card transactions related to Grubhub orders that originated on Yelp. Over the transition period following its acquisition of Eat24 from us in October 2017, Grubhub increasingly processed the credit card transactions related to such orders directly, thereby reducing the fees it paid us to process them on its behalf. Excluding the processing fees earned from Grubhub orders during the transition, transactions revenue from our revenue-sharing arrangements increased in 2019 compared to 2018.\nThe decrease in transactions revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to the sale of Eat24. Prior to the sale, we generated revenue from our Yelp Eat24 business through arrangements with restaurants in which restaurants paid a commission percentage fee on orders placed through the Yelp Eat24 platform, which we recorded on a net basis. Following the sale, we no longer recognize revenue from Yelp Eat24 as a standalone product and instead earn fees on food orders placed through the Grubhub restaurant network that originate on Yelp.\nWe expect the amount of transactions revenue in 2020 to remain consistent with 2019.\nOther Services. We generate revenue through our subscription services, which include our Yelp Reservations, Yelp Waitlist and other subscription products. We also generate revenue through our Yelp Knowledge program, which provides access to Yelp data for a licensing fee, as well as other non-advertising partnerships.\nThe increases in other services revenue in 2019 and 2018 compared to 2018 and 2017, respectively, were primarily due to increases in the number of customers purchasing our subscription products driven by our expanded Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist sales force, as well as increases in revenue from our Yelp Knowledge program mainly due to an increase in the number of partnerships.\nCost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nOur cost of revenue consists primarily of credit card processing fees and website infrastructure expense, which includes website hosting costs and employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for the infrastructure teams responsible for operating our website and mobile app, and excludes depreciation and amortization expense. Cost of revenue also includes third-party advertising fulfillment costs, confirmation services costs associated with Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist, confirmation and delivery services associated with the fulfillment of orders placed through Yelp Eat24 prior to its sale, as well as video production costs for our advertising customers prior to mid-2018.\nThe increase in cost of revenue in 2019 was primarily attributable to:\n\u2022an increase of $3.7 million in advertising fulfillment costs primarily through third-party advertising networks; and\n\u2022an increase in website infrastructure expense of $3.0 million due to increases in the use of our website and in the number of employees supporting the website infrastructure.\nThese increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in merchant fees related to credit card transactions as a result of the decline in transactions revenue following the sale of Eat24 in October 2017.\nThe decrease in 2018 was primarily attributable to:\n\u2022a decrease of $6.8 million in merchant fees related to credit card transactions as a result of the decline in transactions revenue following the sale of Eat24 in October 2017, partially offset by an increase in merchant fees related to credit card transactions as a result of processing more payments from advertisers in connection with an increase in advertising revenue;\n\u2022a decrease of $4.7 million in confirmation services and third-party food delivery costs primarily due to the decline in food ordering fulfillment costs following the sale of Eat24, partially offset by an increase in confirmation services associated with Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist; and\n\u2022a decrease of $3.8 million in set up and creative design costs, primarily associated with video production costs as a result of our transition to selling non-term advertising contracts, when we discontinued video production services for our customers.\nThese decreases were partially offset by an increase of $2.7 million in website infrastructure expense due to increases in the use of our website and in employees supporting the website infrastructure.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including sales commission and stock-based compensation expenses) for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include business and consumer acquisition marketing, community management, as well as allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase of $31.8 million in employee costs resulting from an increase in sales commission expenses due to improved sales team productivity and, to a lesser extent, from increased salary costs driven by higher multi-location sales teams headcount and a larger share of tenured sales representatives throughout our sales organization. The increase in 2019 was partially offset by a decrease of $15.8 million in marketing and advertising costs primarily due to our continued efforts to optimize our marketing spend, particularly as our Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist products drove consumer usage, which allowed us to reduce our reliance on consumer marketing.\nThe increase in sales and marketing expenses in 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase of $48.7 million in employee costs resulting from higher sales headcount and an increase of $10.6 million in facilities and other overhead allocations as we leased additional office space and incurred additional overhead costs for our expanding headcount. The increase in 2018 was partially offset by a decrease of $13.4 million in marketing and advertising costs due to the cessation of Yelp Eat24 marketing activities following our sale of Eat24 in October 2017 and, to a lesser extent, decreases in Yelp-related marketing and advertising costs.\nSales and marketing as a percentage of net revenue was 49% in 2019 and 51% in 2018. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase again in 2020 as the tenure and channel mix of our sales force changes and we continue to invest in marketing, though we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of net revenue. We expect overall sales headcount to be flat in 2020 compared to 2019, with growth in our multi-location sales team offsetting lower local sales headcount as we emphasize the higher-margin sales channel.\nProduct Development\nOur product development expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense, net of capitalized employee costs associated with capitalized website and internal-use software development) for our engineers, product management and corporate infrastructure employees. In addition, product development expenses include allocated facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nThe increases in product development expenses in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to:\n\u2022increases of $15.6 million and $32.1 million, respectively, in employee costs associated with increased headcount to support more research and development activities, primarily for new and enhanced business-owner products as well as, to a lesser extent, enhancements to the consumer experience; and\n\u2022increases of $2.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in facilities and other overhead allocations as we leased additional office space and incurred additional overhead costs for our expanding headcount.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of employee costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for our executive, finance, user operations, legal, people operations and other administrative employees. Our general and administrative expenses also include provision for doubtful accounts, consulting costs, as well as facilities and other supporting overhead costs.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2019 was primarily attributable to $10.3 million in additional employee costs, consulting costs, and facilities and other overhead costs required to support the growth of the business, as well as $7.1 million in fees related to shareholder activism. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of $2.0 million due to an improvement in collection rates from advertising customers.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses in 2018 was primarily attributable to $7.3 million in additional employee costs and an increase in provision for doubtful accounts of $3.6 million. The increase in provision for doubtful accounts was due to continued growth in advertising revenue and the shift in our advertiser base toward newer advertisers, who are typically associated with higher provision for doubtful accounts.\nAdjusting for the fees related to shareholder activism, we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2020 to remain consistent with general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue in 2019, which was 13%.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of depreciation on computer equipment, software, leasehold improvements, capitalized website and software development costs, and amortization of purchased intangible assets.\nThe increases in depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 and 2018 were primarily attributable to increases in depreciation associated with capitalized website and internal use software development costs, as we invested in new products for business owners and consumers as well as leasehold improvements related to additional leased facilities. The increase in 2018 was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to our intangible assets of $3.1 million in connection with the sale of Eat24.\nRestructuring and Integration\nOn November 2, 2016, we announced plans to significantly reduce sales and marketing activities in markets outside of the United States and Canada. The restructuring plan was completed by December 31, 2017.\nWe did not incur any costs related to this plan in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We incurred $0.3 million in restructuring and integration costs associated with this plan in the years ended December 31, 2017 related to severance costs for affected employees. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses related to this plan in the future. No goodwill, intangibles or other long lived assets were impaired as a result of the restructuring plan.\nGain on Disposal of a Business Unit\nOur sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017 resulted in a $163.7 million pre-tax gain. The gain recorded was calculated as proceeds from the disposal, offset by the net assets of Eat24 as of the disposal date, and costs specifically incurred as a result of the sale.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of the interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nOther income, net remained relatively consistent in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on marketable investments offset by a decrease in cash held in interest bearing accounts as a result of the stock repurchase program.\nThe increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in interest income earned on marketable investments and cash held in interest-bearing accounts, particularly due to proceeds received on the sale of Eat24 in October 2017. The increase in 2018 was also due to investing a greater portion of our excess cash in marketable securities.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the United States and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe increase in the provision for income taxes in 2019 (from a recorded benefit in 2018 to a recorded provision in 2019) was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance in 2018,which was previously recorded against certain deferred tax assets. The decrease in the provision for income taxes in 2018 (from a recorded provision in 2017 to a recorded benefit in 2018) was primarily due to the gain on the disposal of Eat24 in 2017, partially offset by the release of our valuation allowance in 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, we have also disclosed below EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We have included EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because they are key measures used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, the exclusion of certain expenses in calculating EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our primary business operations. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In particular, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:\n\u2022although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n\u2022EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n\u2022EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, such as restructuring and integration costs in 2016 and 2017, gain on disposal of a business unit in 2017, and fees related to shareholder activism in 2019; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss), and our other GAAP results. The tables below present reconciliations of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in each case, for each of the periods indicated.\nEBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: (benefit from) provision for income taxes; other income (expense), net; and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other income, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items. For 2019, 2017 and 2016, these other income and expense items consisted of (i) certain fees related to shareholder activism, (ii) gain on disposal of a business unit and restructuring and integration costs, and (iii) restructuring and integration costs, respectively.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,711) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32,900) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for (benefit from) income taxes </td> <td>8,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,344) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,962 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>(14,256) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,109) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,864) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,694) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(386) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>49,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA </td> <td>84,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>220,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td>121,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,261 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60,842 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of a business unit </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(163,697) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and integration costs </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,455 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees related to shareholder activism(2)\n</td> <td>7,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213,495 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>183,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,122 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Amounts for 2015 have not been recast to reflect the adoption of ASC 606.\n(2)Recorded within general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $170.3 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds and investments with original maturities of less than three months. Our cash held internationally as of December 31, 2019 was $11.2 million. We did not have any outstanding bank loans or credit facilities in place as of December 31, 2019.\nOur investment portfolio comprises highly rated marketable securities, and our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires securities to be investment grade (i.e. rated \u2018A+' or higher by bond rating firms) with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To date, we have been able to finance our operations and our acquisitions through proceeds from private and public financings, including our initial public offering in March 2012, our follow-on offering in October 2013, cash generated from operations and, to a lesser extent, cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended, or ESPP. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed our sale of Eat24 to Grubhub and received $252.7 million in cash, with an additional $28.8 million that was held in escrow for an initial 18-month period after closing to secure our indemnification obligations in connection with the sale. The full escrow amount was released to us in April 2019.\nOur future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with any cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, our anticipated repurchases of common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program, payment of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards as well as purchases of property, equipment and software for at least the next 12 months. However, this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash and cash equivalents earlier than presently anticipated. We may require or otherwise seek additional funds in the next 12 months to respond to business\nchallenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance existing services, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies, and, accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds.\nAmounts deposited with third-party financial institutions exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Securities Investor Protection Corporation insurance limits, as applicable. These cash and cash equivalents could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subjected to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash and cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>204,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>167,647 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(164,369) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,136 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(491,519) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(207,747) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,162 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was primarily attributable to net income of $40.9 million and noncash adjustments to net income of $229.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $65.1 million, which included the following:\n\u2022an increase in accounts receivable of $42.1 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, particularly for customers paying in arrears, as well as the timing of payments from these customers;\n\u2022an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million;\n\u2022a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $41.8 million due to operating lease payments made during the year; and\n\u2022an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $20.1 million, primarily driven by an increase in accrued employee compensation and related costs due to a change in the frequency of pay cycles. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses related to various operating expenses.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2018 was primarily attributable to net income of $55.4 million and noncash adjustments to net income of $165.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $60.7 million, which included the following:\n\u2022an increase in accounts receivable of $35.7 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, particularly for customers billed in-arrears, as well as the timing of payments from these customers;\n\u2022an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $5.2 million, primarily driven by increases in deferred contract costs and tax-related receivables, partially offset by a decrease in non-trade receivables; and\n\u2022a decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $19.8 million, primarily driven by a decrease in accrued income taxes as a result of income tax payments made in 2018 on taxable income from 2017, which was primarily a result of the gain on disposal of Eat24. This decrease was partially offset by higher accrued compensation costs as a result of increased headcount.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2017 was primarily attributable to net income of $153.0 million, which included the pre-tax gain on disposal of Eat24 of $163.7 million, and noncash adjustments to net income of $0.3 million, which included the following:\n\u2022an increase in accounts receivable of $36.1 million due to an increase in billings for advertising plans, particularly for customers billed in-arrears, as well as the timing of payments from these customers;\n\u2022an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $2.6 million, primarily due to an increase in tenant improvement allowance receivable and prepaid licenses; and\n\u2022an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $53.0 million, primarily driven by an increase in income taxes payable associated with the gain on disposal of Eat24, accrued bonus and commissions, and various other accrued operating costs and expenses as a result of the growth in our business, offset by a decrease in restaurant revenue share liability as a result of the disposal of Eat24.\nInvesting Activities. Our primary investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted of maturities of marketable securities, purchases of property and equipment to support the ongoing build out of leasehold improvements for our new facility in Washington, D.C., the upgrading of technology hardware for our employees and internally developed software to support website and mobile app development, and our corporate infrastructure. Purchases of property, equipment and software may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our offices, and website and internal-use software and development.\nCash provided by investing activities during 2019 primarily related to the maturity of $674.1 million of investment securities held-to-maturity and the release of an escrow deposit of $28.8 million in connection with our sale of Eat24. Cash provided by investing activities was partially offset by purchases of $541.5 million of marketable securities and expenditures of $37.5 million of property, equipment and software, primarily related to investments in website and mobile app development, as well as internal-use software.\nCash used in investing activities during 2018 was primarily attributable to purchases of $751.2 million of marketable securities and expenditures of $45.0 million of property, equipment and software, primarily related to investments in website and mobile app development, as well as internal-use software. Cash used in investing activities was partially offset by the maturity of $613.7 million of investment securities held-to-maturity and the sale of $17.9 million of investment securities prior to maturity (refer to Note 4, \"Fair Value of Financial Instruments,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details regarding the sale of held-to-maturity investment).\nCash provided by investing activities during 2017 primarily related to $252.7 million net cash received for the sale of Eat24 to Grubhub on October 10, 2017 and $264.0 million of maturities of investment securities held-to-maturity. Cash provided by investing was offset by purchases of marketable securities of $354.9 million, expenditures of $30.2 million of property, equipment and software, primarily related to investments in website and mobile app development, as well as internal-use software, our acquisition of Nowait for net cash consideration of $30.8 million, which included intangible assets of $12.7 million, and our acquisition of Turnstyle for net cash consideration of $19.7 million, which included intangible assets of $4.3 million.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used for financing activities during 2019 comprised $481.0 million to repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and $42.8 million to pay taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards for our employees. These were partially offset by $32.3 million in cash generated from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock under the ESPP.\nCash used in financing activities during 2018 comprised $187.4 million to repurchase shares of common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program and $50.1 million to pay taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards for our employees, partially offset by $29.8 million in cash generated from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock under the ESPP.\nCash provided by financing activities during 2017 was primarily due to net proceeds of $40.9 million generated from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock under the ESPP. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by $12.6 million in repurchases of common stock and $1.2 million of taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards for our international employees.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn July 2017, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired 4,896,003 shares and 302,206 shares, respectively, for aggregate purchase prices of $187.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. We completed the repurchase of the full $200 million authorization in November 2018.\nOn each of November 27, 2018 and February 11. 2019, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of our outstanding common stock, bringing the amount of repurchases authorized under our stock repurchase program to $700 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired 14,190,409 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $481.0 million. On January 15, 2020, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of our outstanding common stock, bringing the total amount of repurchases authorized under our stock repurchase program to $950 million, of which approximately $269.0 million remains available.\nWe may purchase shares at our discretion in the open market, privately negotiated transactions, in transactions structured through investment banking institutions, or a combination of the foregoing. The program is not subject to any time limit and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The amount and timing of repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including liquidity, cash flow and market conditions.\nWe have funded all repurchases to date and expect to fund future repurchases with cash available on our balance sheet. As a result, we expect that cash used in financing activities will continue to increase as we make repurchases pursuant to this program.\nNet Share Settlement of Equity Awards\nIn 2017, we began settling the employee tax liabilities associated with the vesting of RSUs through net share withholding for our internationally based employees, rather than selling a portion of the vested shares to cover taxes, as we had previously. In 2018, we expanded this practice of net share settlement for the vesting of RSUs to all employees. As a result, we paid $42.8 million, $50.1 million and $1.2 million of employee taxes in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, out of cash held on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act, in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California, under operating lease agreements that expire from 2019 to 2029. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. We do not have any debt or material capital lease obligations, and all of our property, equipment and software have been purchased with cash. As of December 31, 2019, we had no material long-term purchase obligations outstanding with vendors or third parties other than purchases of website hosting services. The following table summarizes our future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases and purchase obligations for equipment and office facilities as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1 - 3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3 - 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than 5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>274,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,772 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) In October 2019, the Company entered into a lease agreement for an office facility in London, U.K. for which the lease term has not yet commenced, with lease obligations of approximately $15.0 million. The lease is expected to commence in 2020 and will expire 2030. The Company expects to classify it as an operating lease. Because the lease had not yet commenced as of December 31, 2019, payments related to this lease are not included in the above table.\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with binding agreements and do not include obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, our total liability for uncertain tax positions was $5.6 million. We are not reasonably able to estimate the timing of future cash flow related to this liability. As a result, this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above.\nWe have subleased certain office facilities under operating lease agreements that expire in 2025. The terms of these lease agreements provide for rental receipts on a graduated basis. We recognize sublease rentals on a straight-line basis over the lease\nperiods reflected as a reduction in rental expense. As of December 31, 2019, our future minimum rental receipts to be received under non-cancelable subleases were $37.5 million.", "summary": "The report discusses the company's financial condition and performance, including its revenue streams, investments, and strategic initiatives.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs a trusted local resource, we deliver significant value to both consumers and businesses by helping each discover and interact with the other. Our unrivaled content helps consumers save time and money. Our advertising and other products help business owners increase their visibility and connect with our large audience of purchase-oriented consumers.\nOur comprehensive, mobile-first platform offers reservation and waitlist, food ordering and quote request capabilities, among many other opportunities for consumers to engage with businesses, in addition to the 189.9 million reviews available as of December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, these features attracted a monthly average audience of nearly 35.6 million app unique devices, allowed over 8.8 million diners to make reservations or join a restaurant waitlist, and facilitated consumer submissions of 2.1 million projects to service providers through Request-A-Quote. In the same period, business owners, in turn, promoted their businesses to our large audience by spending 10% more on our advertising products than in the fourth quarter of 2018, seated more than double the number of diners via Yelp compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and received millions of leads through Request-A-Quote.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising products. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our net revenue was $1.0 billion, which represented an increase of 8% from the year ended December 31, 2018, and we recorded net income of $40.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $213.5 million. In the year ended December 31, 2018, our net revenue was $942.8 million, which represented an increase of 11% from the year ended December 31, 2017, and we recorded net income of $55.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $183.1 million. For information on how we define and calculate adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nFollowing our transition to a multi-channel, on-demand business model, which we completed in 2018 with our move to non-term advertising contracts, we embarked on an ambitious, multi-year business transformation plan designed to drive and sustain profitable long-term growth. As we continue executing on our plan in 2020, we will look to further advance the strategic initiatives we began in 2019:\n\u2022Winning in Key Categories. We made significant accomplishments in 2019 in our key categories of restaurants and home & local services. In restaurants, we more than doubled the number of diners seated via Yelp and increased the combined revenue attributable to Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist by a double-digit percentage compared to 2018, while in home & local services we significantly increased paid leads to advertisers and increased revenue attributable to Request-A-Quote by nearly 60% compared to 2018. We believe these categories continue to present substantial opportunities for revenue growth, and plan to pursue those opportunities in 2020 by increasing monetization of our restaurants offerings through price optimization and cross selling, and increasing the number of paid leads delivered to home & local services advertisers.\n\u2022Expanding Our Product Offerings. Our introduction of a range of paid products at affordable price points over the course of 2019, including our Business Highlights, Portfolios and Yelp Connect products, attracted thousands of new customers and helped accelerate revenue growth in our self-serve channel to 30% in 2019. Matching advertisers to the right products at the right prices will be a top priority for us in 2020, and we plan to introduce additional profile products in 2020 that will help business owners tell their stories and build trust with customers.\n\u2022Providing More Value to Business Owners. In 2019, we delivered significantly more value to our customers - we generated 34% more ad clicks for Yelp advertisers at an average CPC 18% lower than in 2018 - and saw improved retention among non-term advertisers as a result. We accomplished this through improvements to our advertising auction system and ad targeting, as well as by expanding advertising inventory in certain categories such as home & local services. In 2020, we plan to continue generating more value for our business customers through initiatives including further enhancements to our auction system, improvements to our Request-A-Quote lead matching and introducing new types of advertising inventory.\n\u2022Capturing the Multi-location Opportunity. Our multi-location advertising business grew 22% in 2019 from the prior year, and our initiatives to increase our business with the top 250 restaurants and retailers by revenue successfully resulted in a substantial number of such businesses becoming paying customers by the end of the year. We plan to drive continued momentum in our multi-location advertising business in 2020 by growing our multi-location sales team to expand our coverage to the services category, as well as by continuing to integrate product development with sales efforts through the introduction of new ad formats tailored to the needs of multi-location businesses.\n\u2022Enhancing the Consumer Experience. In addition to successfully increasing the number of paid leads we delivered to advertisers while maintaining an engaging experience for consumers, we enhanced the consumer experience through more personalized recommendations, new Yelp Waitlist features and expanded restaurant health inspection scores. An engaged consumer base is at the heart of our value proposition to businesses, and we plan to drive engagement in 2020 through an updated user interface for our mobile app (where we find our most engaged users) that offers improved convenience and ease of use.\n\u2022Improved Profitability. In the first year of our multi-year business transformation plan, we improved the structural economics of our business. Our focus on growth and retention in our highest-margin sales channels allowed us to increase revenue growth without expanding our local sales force; in fact, we reduced local sales headcount by 10% in 2019. We expect these structural improvements to help drive profitable growth again in 2020 as we continue to emphasize our most efficient sales channels as well as work to improve retention, optimize our cost structure and control expenses.\nWe expect to continue to invest in product development, personnel and the facilities to support them in 2020 as we work to grow our business, including investments to increase our office space, upgrade our technology and infrastructure to improve the ability of our platform to handle the projected increase in usage, and enable the release of new products and features. As a result of this investment philosophy, we expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nOur Ability to Attract and Retain Advertisers. Our revenue growth is driven by our ability to attract and retain advertising customers. To do so, we must deliver compelling ad products in an effective manner, at prices that compare favorably to those of our competitors. Our advertisers typically do not have long-term obligations to purchase our products. A substantial and increasing portion also have the ability to cancel their ad campaigns at any time. Their decisions to renew depend on the degree of satisfaction with our products as well as a number of factors that are outside of our control, including their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. Although we have shifted our focus to the opportunity presented by multi-location businesses recently, we continue to rely heavily on SMBs that often have limited advertising budgets and that may view online advertising products like ours as experimental and unproven.\nOur ability to maintain and expand our advertiser base also depends on the size and productivity of our sales force and customer success team. As we continue to invest in expanding our multi-location sales organization while maintaining a large local sales force, we must efficiently scale our operations while at the same time recruiting, training and integrating new hires and developing, motivating and retaining existing employees. Similarly, in order to retain, and take advantage of opportunities to deepen our relationships with, our existing customers, we must continue our efforts to build out our customer success team. Developing our account retention processes will be particularly important as an increasing portion of our advertisers have the ability to cancel their contracts at any time. In addition, as we make periodic adjustments to our sales organization to respond to market opportunities and to pursue initiatives to increase productivity, such changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or disruption to our operations. For example, it took time for our sales and customer success organizations to adapt to selling and supporting advertising contracts with flexible cancellation terms. Our increased emphasis on our multi-location and self-serve channels involves changes to our sales organization and sales force hiring priorities, which may be disruptive to our sales operations.\nTraffic and User Engagement. We derive substantially all of our revenue from advertising, and traffic to our platform determines the number of ads we are able to show, affects the value of those ads to businesses and influences the content creation that drives further traffic. As a result, our ability to grow our business depends on our ability to increase traffic on our platform, which in turn depends on, among other things, the quality of our content and the prominence of links to our platform in Internet search engine results and application marketplaces. The number of users we attract from search engines in particular can be affected by a number of factors not in our direct control; changes in a search engine's ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts may result in links to our website not being prominent enough to drive traffic to our website and mobile app. In addition, certain providers of Internet search engines and application marketplaces offer products and services that compete\ndirectly with our products and, in some instances, such providers may change their displays or rankings in order to promote their own competing products or services.\nWe anticipate that our traffic growth will continue to slow over time, and potentially decrease in certain periods, as our business matures and we achieve higher penetration rates in our core markets of the United States and Canada. As our traffic growth rate slows, our success will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement on our platform, which itself depends on the quality of our content and our ability to introduce new and improved products that effectively address consumer needs, among other things.\nProduct Innovation. We must deliver innovative, relevant and useful products to consumers and businesses - including products for mobile and other alternative devices - to expand the size and engagement of our user base, attract advertisers and increase our revenue. We plan to continue investing in new product development as we introduce new advertising and e-commerce products, explore new platforms and distribution channels, and develop partner arrangements that provide incremental value to our users and advertisers to encourage them to increase their usage of, and the portion of their advertising budgets allocated to, our platform. As our industry evolves and competition intensifies, our investments may increasingly include products and services outside of our historical core business, such as our continued development of Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist. These investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, such as distracting management, and may ultimately fail to generate sufficient revenue or other value to justify our investments in them.\nInvestment in Growth. We have invested, and intend to continue to invest, aggressively to support the growth of our platform. We dedicate significant resources to areas such as: marketing; consumer protection; maintaining and enhancing the Yelp brand; and upgrading our systems, technology and network infrastructure to accommodate growth. Our investment plans for 2020 include developing new advertising products, further developing our analytics tools for advertisers, improving our Request-A-Quote matching capabilities and refining our advertising auction system. While we believe these initiatives will ultimately drive revenue growth, our investments in them will increase our operating expenses, and any increase in revenue resulting from these product innovations will likely trail the increase in expenses.\nStock Repurchases. In July 2017, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired 4,896,003 shares and 302,206 shares, respectively, for aggregate purchase prices of $187.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. On each of November 27, 2018 and February 11, 2019, our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of our outstanding common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program, of which we repurchased on the open market and subsequently retired 14,190,409 shares for an aggregate purchase price of $481.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. On January 15, 2020, our board approved a further increase of $250 million to our stock repurchase program, bringing the total amount of repurchases authorized under our stock repurchase program to $950 million, of which approximately $269 million remains available. We have funded the repurchases, and expect to fund future repurchases under the stock repurchase program, with cash available on our balance sheet. As a result, this program could diminish our cash reserves and reduce our ability to invest in our business, in addition to affecting the trading price and volatility of our stock.\nCorporate Development Activities. As part of our business strategy, we may decide to expand our product offerings and grow our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies, as well as through partnerships. In addition to diverting our management's attention and otherwise disrupting our operations, our corporate development activities will affect our future financial results due to factors such as expenses incurred in identifying, investigating and pursuing transactions, whether or not they are consummated, possible dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, unidentified liabilities and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Maintaining relationships with partners also requires significant time and resources, as does integrating their data, services and technologies onto our platform. We may not realize the full benefits of synergies, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible from a corporate transaction; similarly, if our relationships with partners deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide consumers and advertisers with our content or services.\nSeasonality and Cyclicality. Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and advertising spending, as well as cyclicality in economic activity. Based on historical trends, we expect traffic numbers to be weakest in the fourth quarter of the year in connection with end of the year holidays. In addition, although our multi-location customers tend to increase spending on advertising in the fourth quarter, the SMBs on which we rely heavily typically decrease their advertising spending during this quarter. SMBs may be disproportionately affected by negative fluctuations in the business cycle, and a worsening economic outlook would likely cause such businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which would adversely affect our revenue. As our business matures and the proportion of our customers who can cancel their ad campaigns at any time\nincreases, we expect that the seasonality and cyclicality in our business may become more pronounced, causing our operating results to fluctuate.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the key metrics set forth below, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Unless otherwise stated, these metrics do not include metrics for Yelp Reservations, Yelp Waitlist, Yelp WiFi Marketing, our business owner products or Yelp Eat24, which we sold on October 10, 2017.\nReviews\nNumber of reviews represents the cumulative number of reviews submitted to Yelp since inception, as of the period end, including reviews that were not recommended or had been removed from our platform. In addition to the text of the review, each review includes a rating of one to five stars. We include reviews that are not recommended and that have been removed because all of them are either currently accessible on our platform or were accessible at some point in time, providing information that may be useful to users to evaluate businesses and individual reviewers. Because our automated recommendation software continually reassesses which reviews to recommend based on new information that becomes available, the recommended\u201d or not recommended\u201d status of reviews may change over time. Reviews that are not recommended or that have been removed do not factor into a business's overall star rating. By clicking on a link on a reviewed business's page on our website, users can access the reviews that are not currently recommended for the business, as well as the star rating and other information about reviews that were removed for violation of our terms of service.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 189.9 million reviews were available on business listing pages, including approximately 44.4 million reviews that were not recommended, after 15.5 million reviews had been removed from our platform, either by us for violation of our terms of service or by the users who contributed them. The following table presents the number of cumulative reviews as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\n\nTraffic\nTraffic to our website and mobile app has three components: mobile devices accessing our mobile app, visitors to our non-mobile optimized website, which we refer to as our desktop website, and visitors to our mobile-optimized website, which we refer to as our mobile website. App users generate a substantial majority of activity on Yelp, including the page views and ad clicks that we monetize. We anticipate that our mobile traffic will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future and that traffic to our website will fluctuate and generally decline as we focus on driving traffic to our mobile app, where we have our most engaged users and which reduces our reliance on Google and other search engines.\nWe use the metrics set forth below to measure each of our traffic streams. An individual user who accesses our platform through multiple traffic streams will be counted in each applicable traffic metric; as a result, the sum of our traffic metrics will not accurately represent the number of people who visit our platform on an average monthly basis.\nApp Unique Devices. We calculate app unique devices as the number of unique mobile devices using our mobile app in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Under this method of calculation, an individual who accesses our mobile app from multiple mobile devices will be counted as multiple app unique devices. Multiple individuals who access our mobile app from a shared device will be counted as a single app unique device.\nThe following table presents app unique devices for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nDesktop and Mobile Website Unique Visitors. We calculate desktop unique visitors as the number of users,\u201d as measured by Google Analytics, who have visited our desktop website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Similarly, we calculate mobile website unique visitors as the number of users\u201d who have visited our mobile website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period.\nGoogle Analytics, a product from Google Inc. that provides digital marketing intelligence, measures users\u201d based on unique cookie identifiers. Because the numbers of desktop unique visitors and mobile website unique visitors are therefore based on unique cookies, an individual who accesses our desktop website or mobile website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple desktop unique visitors or mobile website unique visitors, as applicable, and multiple individuals who access our desktop website or mobile website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single desktop unique visitor or mobile website unique visitor.\nThe following table presents our web traffic for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nWe have discovered in the past, and expect to discover in the future, that portions of our desktop traffic, as measured by Google Analytics, have been attributable to robots and other invalid sources. Because traffic from such sources does not represent valid consumer traffic, our reported desktop unique visitor metric for impacted periods reflects an adjustment to the Google Analytics measurement of our traffic to remove traffic that we have identified as originating from invalid sources to provide greater accuracy and transparency. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify all such traffic for any particular period. For additional information, please see the risk factor included under Part I, Item 1A under the heading We rely on data from both internal tools and third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nActive Claimed Local Business Locations\nThe number of active claimed local business locations represents the number of claimed local business locations - business addresses for which a business representative has visited our platform and claimed the free business listing page for the business located at that address - that are both (a) active on Yelp and (b) associated with an active business owner account as of a given date. We consider a claimed local business location to be active if it has not closed, been removed from our platform or merged with another claimed local business.\nThe following table presents the number of active claimed locations as of the dates presented (in thousands). The December 31, 2018 and 2017 numbers have been updated to reflect our current methodology for calculating active claimed local business locations.\n\nPaying Advertising Locations\nPaying advertising locations comprise all business locations associated with a business account from which we recognized advertising revenue in a given month, excluding business accounts that purchased advertising through partner programs other than Yelp Ads Certified Partners, averaged over a given three-month period. The following table presents the number of paying advertising locations for the periods presented (in thousands):\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and internal-use software development costs, the incremental borrowing rate used in adopting the new leasing standard, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on these and our other significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages). The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs, and involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included under Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report. See Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nAs a trusted local resource, we deliver significant value to both consumers and businesses by helping each discover and interact with the other. Our unrivaled content helps consumers save time and money. Our advertising and other products help business owners increase their visibility and connect with our large audience of purchase-oriented consumers.\nOur comprehensive, mobile-first platform offers reservation and waitlist, food ordering and quote request capabilities, among many other opportunities for consumers to engage with businesses, in addition to the 189.9 million reviews available as of December 31, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2019, these features attracted a monthly average audience of nearly 35.6 million app unique devices, allowed over 8.8 million diners to make reservations or join a restaurant waitlist, and facilitated consumer submissions of 2.1 million projects to service providers through Request-A-Quote. In the same period, business owners, in turn, promoted their businesses to our large audience by spending 10% more on our advertising products than in the fourth quarter of 2018, seated more than double the number of diners via Yelp compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and received millions of leads through Request-A-Quote.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of advertising products. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our net revenue was $1.0 billion, which represented an increase of 8% from the year ended December 31, 2018, and we recorded net income of $40.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $213.5 million. In the year ended December 31, 2018, our net revenue was $942.8 million, which represented an increase of 11% from the year ended December 31, 2017, and we recorded net income of $55.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $183.1 million. For information on how we define and calculate adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income (loss), see Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d below.\nFollowing our transition to a multi-channel, on-demand business model, which we completed in 2018 with our move to non-term advertising contracts, we embarked on an ambitious, multi-year business transformation plan designed to drive and sustain profitable long-term growth. As we continue executing on our plan in 2020, we will look to further advance the strategic initiatives we began in 2019:\n\u2022Winning in Key Categories. We made significant accomplishments in 2019 in our key categories of restaurants and home & local services. In restaurants, we more than doubled the number of diners seated via Yelp and increased the combined revenue attributable to Yelp Reservations and Yelp Waitlist by a double-digit percentage compared to 2018, while in home & local services we significantly increased paid leads to advertisers and increased revenue attributable to Request-A-Quote by nearly 60% compared to 2018. We believe these categories continue to present substantial opportunities for revenue growth, and plan to pursue those opportunities in 2020 by increasing monetization of our restaurants offerings through price optimization and cross selling, and increasing the number of paid leads delivered to home & local services advertisers.\n\u2022Expanding Our Product Offerings. Our introduction of a range of paid products at affordable price points over the course of 2019, including our Business Highlights, Portfolios and Yelp Connect products, attracted thousands of new customers and helped accelerate revenue growth in our self-serve channel to 30% in 2019. Matching advertisers to the right products at the right prices will be a top priority for us in 2020, and we plan to introduce additional profile products in 2020 that will help business owners tell their stories and build trust with customers.\n\u2022Providing More Value to Business Owners. In 2019, we delivered significantly more value to our customers - we generated 34% more ad clicks for Yelp advertisers at an average CPC 18% lower than in 2018 - and saw improved retention among non-term advertisers as a result. We accomplished this through improvements to our advertising auction system and ad targeting, as well as by expanding advertising inventory in certain categories such as home & local services. In 2020, we plan to continue generating more value for our business customers through initiatives including further enhancements to our auction system, improvements to our Request-A-Quote lead matching and introducing new types of advertising inventory.\n\u2022Capturing the Multi-location Opportunity. Our multi-location advertising business grew 22% in 2019 from the prior year, and our initiatives to increase our business with the top 250 restaurants and retailers by revenue successfully resulted in a substantial number of such businesses becoming paying customers by the end of the year.

By clicking on a link on a reviewed business's page on our website, users can access the reviews that are not currently recommended for the business, as well as the star rating and other information about reviews that were removed for violation of our terms of service.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 189.9 million reviews were available on business listing pages, including approximately 44.4 million reviews that were not recommended, after 15.5 million reviews had been removed from our platform, either by us for violation of our terms of service or by the users who contributed them. The following table presents the number of cumulative reviews as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reviews </td> <td>205,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,298 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTraffic\nTraffic to our website and mobile app has three components: mobile devices accessing our mobile app, visitors to our non-mobile optimized website, which we refer to as our desktop website, and visitors to our mobile-optimized website, which we refer to as our mobile website. App users generate a substantial majority of activity on Yelp, including the page views and ad clicks that we monetize. We anticipate that our mobile traffic will be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future and that traffic to our website will fluctuate and generally decline as we focus on driving traffic to our mobile app, where we have our most engaged users and which reduces our reliance on Google and other search engines.\nWe use the metrics set forth below to measure each of our traffic streams. An individual user who accesses our platform through multiple traffic streams will be counted in each applicable traffic metric; as a result, the sum of our traffic metrics will not accurately represent the number of people who visit our platform on an average monthly basis.\nApp Unique Devices. We calculate app unique devices as the number of unique mobile devices using our mobile app in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Under this method of calculation, an individual who accesses our mobile app from multiple mobile devices will be counted as multiple app unique devices. Multiple individuals who access our mobile app from a shared device will be counted as a single app unique device.\nThe following table presents app unique devices for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>App Unique Devices </td> <td>35,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDesktop and Mobile Website Unique Visitors. We calculate desktop unique visitors as the number of users,\u201d as measured by Google Analytics, who have visited our desktop website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period. Similarly, we calculate mobile website unique visitors as the number of users\u201d who have visited our mobile website at least once in a given month, averaged over a given three-month period.\nGoogle Analytics, a product from Google Inc. that provides digital marketing intelligence, measures users\u201d based on unique cookie identifiers. Because the numbers of desktop unique visitors and mobile website unique visitors are therefore based on unique cookies, an individual who accesses our desktop website or mobile website from multiple devices with different cookies may be counted as multiple desktop unique visitors or mobile website unique visitors, as applicable, and multiple individuals who access our desktop website or mobile website from a shared device with a single cookie may be counted as a single desktop unique visitor or mobile website unique visitor.\nThe following table presents our web traffic for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Desktop Unique Visitors </td> <td>54,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,748 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mobile Web Unique Visitors </td> <td>68,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,221 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have discovered in the past, and expect to discover in the future, that portions of our desktop traffic, as measured by Google Analytics, have been attributable to robots and other invalid sources. Because traffic from such sources does not represent valid consumer traffic, our reported desktop unique visitor metric for impacted periods reflects an adjustment to the Google Analytics measurement of our traffic to remove traffic that we have identified as originating from invalid sources to provide greater accuracy and transparency. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify all such traffic for any particular period. For additional information, please see the risk factor included under Part I, Item 1A under the heading We rely on data from both internal tools and third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\u201d\nActive Claimed Local Business Locations\nThe number of active claimed local business locations represents the number of claimed local business locations - business addresses for which a business representative has visited our platform and claimed the free business listing page for the business located at that address - that are both (a) active on Yelp and (b) associated with an active business owner account as of a given date. We consider a claimed local business location to be active if it has not closed, been removed from our platform or merged with another claimed local business.\nThe following table presents the number of active claimed locations as of the dates presented (in thousands). The December 31, 2018 and 2017 numbers have been updated to reflect our current methodology for calculating active claimed local business locations.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active Claimed Local Business Locations </td> <td>4,913 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPaying Advertising Locations\nPaying advertising locations comprise all business locations associated with a business account from which we recognized advertising revenue in a given month, excluding business accounts that purchased advertising through partner programs other than Yelp Ads Certified Partners, averaged over a given three-month period. The following table presents the number of paying advertising locations for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paying Advertising Locations </td> <td>565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, website and internal-use software development costs, the incremental borrowing rate used in adopting the new leasing standard, business combinations, allowance for doubtful accounts, income taxes and stock-based compensation expense have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on these and our other significant accounting policies, see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except percentages).
