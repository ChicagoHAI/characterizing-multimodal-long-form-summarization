MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction and Business Overview\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United States. We provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our partners\u201d. During 2015, we financed $113.6 billion of purchase volume, and at December 31, 2015, we had $68.3 billion of loan receivables and 68.3 million active accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net earnings of $2.2 billion, representing a return on assets of 2.9%.\nWe offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Synchrony Bank (the \"Bank\"). Through the Bank, we offer a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d). We are continuing to expand our direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. We had $43.4 billion in deposits at December 31, 2015.\nOur Separation from GE\nOn October 14, 2015, we received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board\u201d) to become a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, to retain control of the Bank and to retain control of our nonbank subsidiaries following the completion of GE's offer to exchange shares of GE common stock for all of our shares of our common stock owned by GE (the exchange offer\u201d). On November 17, 2015, we announced the completion of the exchange offer and our separation from GE (the \"Separation\"). Following the Separation, GE no longer owns any of our outstanding common stock.\nOur Sales Platforms\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our operations are within the United States. We offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit). Those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are measured on platform revenue, loan receivables, new accounts and other sales metrics. See Item 1. Business-Our Sales Platforms.\u201d\n______________________\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>For a definition of platform revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, and its reconciliation to interest and fees on loans, see Results of Operations-Platform Analysis-Non-GAAP Measure\u201d.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Retail Card\nRetail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. We offer one or more of these products primarily through 22 national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements. The average length of our relationship with these Retail Card partners is 17 years. Retail Card's platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, plus other income, less retailer share arrangements. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on Dual Card transactions (when the card is used outside of our partners' sales channels) and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms.\nPayment Solutions\nPayment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. At December 31, 2015, Payment Solutions offered these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. Payment Solutions' platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts,\u201d which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.\nCareCredit\nCareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. At December 31, 2015, we had a network of CareCredit providers that collectively have approximately 195,000 locations, the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers, through which we offer a CareCredit branded private label credit card. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. CareCredit's platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts.\nOur Credit Products\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nThrough our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. See Item 1. Business - Our Credit Products.\u201d\nCredit Cards\nWe offer two principal types of credit cards: private label credit cards and Dual Cards:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Private label credit cards. Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe's or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., CarCareONE or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In Retail Card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in Payment Solutions and CareCredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dual Cards. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. Credit extended under our Dual Cards typically is extended under standard terms only. Currently, only Retail Card offers Dual Cards. At December 31, 2015, we offered Dual Cards through 16 of our 22 active Retail Card programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Commercial Credit Products\nWe offer private label cards and co-branded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer our commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.\nInstallment Loans\nIn Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power product market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates.\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Growth in loan receivables and interest income. We believe continuing improvement in the U.S. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. In addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. We anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. In the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. Our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. In addition, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term, and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on interest-earning assets will remain relatively stable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements. We have extended many of our largest Retail Card program agreements, and as a result, we expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis as indicated by the expiration schedule, which indicates for each period the number of programs scheduled to expire and the proportion of platform revenue that these programs comprised for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Business - Retail Card\u201d for additional information on the expiration of these programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A total of 17 of our 22 Retail Card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond. These 17 program agreements represented in the aggregate 89.7% of our Retail Card platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 91.6% of our Retail Card loan receivables at December 31, 2015.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increases in retailer share arrangement payments and other expense under extended program agreements. We believe that as a result of both the overall growth of our programs, as well as amendments we have made to the terms of certain program agreements that we extended during 2015, the payments we make to our partners under these extended retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, are likely to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our net earnings. Overall, we expect our payments to our partners under our retailer share arrangements to grow generally in line with the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition, under the terms of certain program agreements we have extended in recent years, we have agreed to dedicate increased marketing expense and other investments to promote these programs. We expect to benefit from these increased payments and other expenses, as they will create additional incentives for our partners to support their programs and, in the case of increased marketing expense and other investments, directly promote these programs, all of which we expect will have a positive impact on purchase volume and result in higher loan receivables and increased interest and fees on loans. We also expect to benefit from the extended duration of our amended program agreements.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Stable asset quality. Our credit performance continued to improve through 2015. Our net charge-off rates decreased to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our over-30 day delinquency rate decreased to 4.06% at December 31, 2015 from 4.14% at December 31, 2014, which are lower year-end levels than we experienced immediately prior to the financial crisis in 2007. In the near term, we expect the U.S. employment rate to continue to stabilize, and we do not anticipate making significant changes to our underwriting standards. Accordingly, we expect our charge-off rates to remain relatively stable in the near term. Provision for loan losses increased slightly by $35 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as the growth in loan receivables was partially offset by the benefit from improving asset quality trends. As the credit environment stabilizes, we do not believe this benefit will repeat in the near term and expect that our provision for loan losses will increase at a higher rate than we experienced in 2015, primarily driven by our receivables growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners' locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. Overall, we expect both our interchange revenues and loyalty program costs to grow in excess of the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables, and expect the increase in loyalty program costs to be higher than that expected for interchange revenues due to the additional loyalty programs for our private label credit cards. These increases have been contemplated in our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Impact of regulatory developments. Our business and the consumer financial services industry continues to be subject to regulation from various regulatory authorities, including the CFPB, which was established through the Dodd Frank Act. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $9 million, $26 million and $133 million, respectively, in expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters. The expenses incurred in 2013, primarily related to an increase to our reserve for the matters settled with the CFPB and the DOJ in late 2013 and 2014. See Item 1. Business-Regulation-Consumer Financial Services Regulation.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capital and liquidity levels. We expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. Following the Separation, we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by, among other things, retaining net earnings and not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until we have the non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to do so. Our board of directors intends to establish dividends and share repurchases programs, in each case consistent with maintaining capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Company had an estimated fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.9%. We also expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeasonality\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.\nThe seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.\nIn addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.\nResults of Operations\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nKey Earnings Metrics\nGrowth Metrics\nAsset Quality Metrics\nCapital and Liquidity\n______________________\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a) Represents Tier 1 common equity calculated under Basel I regulatory capital standards, see Item 7. -Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital-Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b) Calculated under Basel III regulatory capital standards, subject to transition provisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHighlights for Year Ended December 31, 2015\nBelow are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net earnings increased 5.0% to $2,214 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangements, provision for loan losses and other expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loan receivables increased 11.4% to $68,290 million at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth, and included growth associated with the BP portfolio acquired in the second quarter of 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net interest income increased 6.8% to $12,093 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher average loan receivables, partially offset by higher interest expense driven by increased liquidity, funding mix and growth.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Retailer share arrangements increased 6.3% to $2,738 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.06% at December 31, 2015 from 4.14% at December 31, 2014, primarily driven by improving asset quality trends and general improvement in the U.S. economy.

provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.\nWe analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets.

Our cost of funds increased to 1.82% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.69% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense increased by $180 million, or 24.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven primarily by increases in average interest-bearing liabilities of $7,104 million, or 14.9% and an increase of 13 basis points in cost of funds.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,148\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings of consolidated securitization entities\n</td> <td>13,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party debt\n</td> <td>10,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Related party debt\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total average interest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increases in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits and the issuance of third-party debt to replace our related party funding from GECC.\nThe increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven primarily by increases of $7,705 million in our average interest-bearing deposit accounts, as well as from the new third-party debt incurred in connection with the IPO, partially offset by a reduction in average borrowings under our securitization programs and our related party debt.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense. We expect net interest income as a percentage of interest-earning assets to be influenced by changes in the interest rate environment, changes in our mix of products, the level of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to our standard rates, credit performance of our loans and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-bearing liabilities.\nNet interest income increased by $773 million, or 6.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by higher average loan receivables, partially offset by increased interest expense driven by higher liquidity, funding mix and growth.\nNet interest income increased by $749 million, or 7.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by growth in loan receivables, partially offset by higher interest expense and a decrease in our yield on interest-earning assets due to a higher average interest-earning cash and equivalents balance.\nRetailer Share Arrangements\nMost of our Retail Card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. These arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although the share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have increased in recent years (both in absolute terms and as a proportion of interest income), partially as a result of the growth of our receivables related to programs with retailer share arrangements and improvements in the credit performance of these receivables. In addition, we have made changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years that have contributed to the increase in payments to partners pursuant to retailer share arrangements.\nWe believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners' interests with ours. We also believe that changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have contributed to the increase in our retailer share arrangement payments will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.\nRetailer share arrangements increased by $163 million, or 6.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven primarily by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs.\nRetailer share arrangements increased by $202 million, or 8.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by the growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, including the effect of a lower provision for loan losses. The increase was also driven by changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in the second half of 2013 and in 2014.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss (i.e., aged, fraud, deceased, settlement, other non-aged and bankruptcy) by partner. See Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology.\nProvision for loan losses increased by $35 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to portfolio growth, partially offset by improving asset quality trends. Our allowance coverage ratio decreased to 5.12% at December 31, 2015, as compared to 5.28% at December 31, 2014, reflecting the recent improvements in our asset quality trends.\nProvision for loan losses decreased by $155 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of $642 million recorded in 2013 relating to enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology, which was not repeated in the current period. This decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily related to portfolio growth. Our allowance coverage ratio increased to 5.28% at December 31, 2014, as compared to 5.05% at December 31, 2013, reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at December 31, 2014 from an improving outlook at December 31, 2013.\nOther Income\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt cancellation fees\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loyalty programs\n</td> <td>(419\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(281\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterchange revenue\nWe earn interchange fees on Dual Card transactions outside of our partners' sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount. We also process general purpose card transactions for some Payment Solutions and CareCredit partners as their acquiring bank, for which we obtain an interchange fee. Growth in interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card product.\nInterchange revenue increased by $116 million, or 29.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and by $65 million, or 20.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to increased purchase volume outside of our retail partners' sales channels.\nDebt cancellation fees\nDebt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer's credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers online and, on a limited basis, by direct mail. We no longer offer this product via phone calls to our customer service department, which has led to a decrease in new enrollments for this product and is expected to result in a lower level of income generated by this product in the future as the balances of existing accounts enrolled in this program decrease over time.\nDebt cancellation fees decreased by $26 million, or 9.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and by $49 million, or 15.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by fewer customers being enrolled in the product.\nLoyalty programs\nWe operate a number of loyalty programs in our Retail Card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card or Dual Card. Other programs provide cash back or rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards. Growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.\nLoyalty programs cost increased by $138 million, or 49.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and by $68 million, or 31.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, arising from the launch of new rewards programs with our partners and growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs.\nOther\nOther includes a variety of items including ancillary fees and investment gains/losses.\nOther decreased by $45 million, or 44.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased by $37 million, or 56.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. These changes were primarily due to a gain recorded in connection with portfolio sales in 2014.\nOther Expense\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee costs\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>698\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing and business development\n</td> <td>433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Information processing\n</td> <td>297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>875\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEmployee costs\nEmployee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.\nEmployee costs increased by $176 million, or 20.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, and by $168 million, or 24.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily related to additional compensation expenses for new employees related to the building of our stand-alone infrastructure and to support business growth and salary increases for existing employees.\nProfessional fees\nProfessional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.\nProfessional fees increased by $82 million, or 14.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2015. These expense increases were due to business growth, the Separation and higher third-party costs related to the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card accounts.\nProfessional fees increased by $121 million, or 24.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2014. These expense increases were due to higher professional and other consulting fees related to the IPO, the Separation, growth of the retail deposit platform and other business growth (e.g., increased active accounts and increased purchase volumes).\nMarketing and business development\nMarketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.\nMarketing and business development costs decreased by $27 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to lower portfolio marketing investments and lower brand advertising.\nMarketing and business development costs increased by $191 million, or 71.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to increased marketing expenses for our programs, investments in our brand, including the launch of our new advertising campaign, and increased amortization expense associated with program acquisitions and extensions.\nInformation processing\nInformation processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.\nInformation processing costs increased by $85 million, or 40.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to higher information technology investment and higher transaction volume.\nInformation processing costs increased by $19 million, or 9.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, due to higher transaction volume and increased software licensing and maintenance expense.\nOther\nOther primarily consists of postage, fraud expense, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities leases and maintenance, leased equipment and telephone charges. For periods prior to the IPO, we incurred certain corporate overhead costs that were allocated to us by GE. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. Fraud is driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card accounts.\nThe other\u201d component increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to investments in growth, infrastructure build in preparation for separation from GE, higher fraud expense, and also included expenses related to the completion of the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card accounts. These increases were largely offset by the impact of corporate overhead allocations no longer being billed to us by GE following our IPO.\nThe other\u201d component decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to lower corporate overhead allocations and assessments from GECC and a decrease in litigation and regulatory expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in expense driven by business growth. Following the IPO, we no longer receive corporate overhead allocations and assessments from GECC. All services provided by GECC to us following the IPO were directly billed to us in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement, and are included in the appropriate cost categories. See Note 15. Related Party Transactions to our consolidated and combined financial statements for additional information on our transactions with GE and GECC.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor periods up to and including the date of Separation, we are included in the consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns of GE, where applicable, but also file certain separate state and foreign income tax returns. For periods after the date of Separation we will file separate consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Our current obligations for taxes are settled with GE, or the relevant tax authority, as applicable, on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated and combined financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur. We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated and combined financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. See Critical Accounting Estimates-Income Taxes\u201d for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased slightly compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain non-deductible expenses and tax reserves for uncertain income tax positions, partially offset by increases in current state tax rates, and a non-recurring tax expense incurred in the prior year related to an internal corporate reorganization. In each period, the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0%, primarily due to state income taxes.\nPlatform Analysis\nAs discussed above under -Our Sales Platforms,\u201d we offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of the platform revenue for each of our platforms.\nNon-GAAP Measure\nIn order to assess and internally report the revenue performance of our three sales platforms, we use a measure we refer to as platform revenue.\u201d Platform revenue is the sum of three line items in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP: interest and fees on loans,\u201d plus other income,\u201d less retailer share arrangements.\u201d Platform revenue itself is not a measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We deduct retailer share arrangements but do not deduct other line item expenses, such as interest expense, provision for loan losses and other expense, because those items are managed for the business as a whole. We believe that platform revenue is a useful measure to investors because it represents management's view of the net revenue contribution of each of our platforms. This measure should not be considered a substitute for interest and fees on loans or other measures of performance we have reported in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of platform revenue to interest and fees on loans for each platform is set forth in the table included in the discussion of each of our three platforms below. The following table sets forth the reconciliation of total platform revenue to total interest and fees on loans for the periods indicated.\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fees on loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retailer share arrangements\n</td> <td>(2,738\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,575\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail Card\nThe following table sets forth supplemental information related to our Retail Card platform for the periods indicated.\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase volume\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period-end loan receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average loan receivables, including held for sale\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average active accounts (in thousands)\n</td> <td>50,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and fees on loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retailer share arrangements\n</td> <td>(2,688\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,530\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,917\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRetail Card platform revenue increased by $508 million, or 7.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 and by $512 million, or 8.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014.

The services provided included, among other things, employee benefits and benefit administration, information technology, telecommunication services and leases for vehicles, equipment and facilities. Under the TSA, all of the costs billed to us by GE subsequent to the IPO were at GE's cost in accordance with historic billing methodologies. The majority of the services provided by GE have been replaced, and we expect the remaining services will be replaced by mid-2016.\nFor periods prior to the IPO, we were an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of GE and GECC, and in addition to the services discussed above, we also received a corporate overhead allocation and assessment from GE and GECC for corporate activities that either directly or indirectly benefited our business.\nFunding provided by GECC\nGECC no longer provides funding to our business. During the first quarter of 2015, we prepaid all of the remaining outstanding indebtedness provided under the GECC Term Loan. Prior to the IPO, GECC was a key source of funding for our business.\nSee Note 15.

We use short-term (3 to 12 months) or long-term (12 to 60 months) modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve long-term collectability of the loans that are classified as TDRs. For our credit card customers, the short-term program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction, both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months. The long-term program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The long-term program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal, but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. We also make loan modifications for some customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as a consumer credit counseling agency program. The loans that are modified typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. The determination of whether these changes to the terms and conditions meet the TDR criteria includes our consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.\nLoans classified as TDRs are recorded at their present value with impairment measured as the difference between the loan balance and the discounted present value of cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. Our allowance for loan losses on TDRs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows.\nInterest income from loans accounted for as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. We accrue interest on credit card balances until the accounts are charged-off in the period the accounts become 180 days past due. The following table presents the amount of loan receivables that are not accruing interest, loans that are 90 days or more past-due and still accruing interest, and earning TDRs for the periods presented.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31 ($ in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual loan receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans contractually 90 days past-due and still accruing interest\n</td> <td>1,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earning TDRs(1)\n</td> <td>712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-accrual, past-due and restructured loan receivables\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, balances exclude $51 million, $54 million and $70 million, respectively, of TDRs which are included in loans contractually 90 days past-due and still accruing interest balance.

The 8 basis point decrease compared to the same period in prior year was primarily driven by general improvement in the U.S. economy.\nNet Charge-Offs\nNet charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated and Combined Statements of Earnings.\nThe table below sets forth the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, for the periods indicated.\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale\n</td> <td>4.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.51\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $3,497 million at December 31, 2015 compared with $3,236 million at December 31, 2014, representing our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio.

At December 31, 2015, we had $29.7 billion in direct deposits (which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions) and $13.7 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to significantly expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.\nOur direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts.\nBrokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 10 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at December 31, 2015, had a weighted average remaining life of 3.4 years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.\nOur ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding and interest rate risk if we fail, or are required to pay higher rates, to attract new deposits or retain existing deposits. To mitigate these risks, we pursue a funding strategy that seeks to match our assets and liabilities by interest rate and expected maturity characteristics, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.\nOver the next several years, we are seeking to increase our direct deposits through investing in our direct deposit programs and capabilities. The growth of direct deposits will be supported by a significant investment in marketing and brand awareness.\nThe following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated.

In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loans in our trusts are applied to repay principal of the asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business.

The negative covenants also restrict our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to undergo various fundamental changes (including mergers, liquidations, sale-leaseback transactions and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets).\nThe Bank Term Loan also contains financial covenants (to be tested on a quarterly basis) that require (i) Synchrony to maintain a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of not less than 10%, (ii) Synchrony to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than $4.0 billion and (iii) the Bank to maintain minimum liquidity of not less than $2.0 billion. The Bank Term Loan includes customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control (not including the Separation) and the occurrence of certain material adverse regulatory events.\nThe indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) Synchrony's ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.\nIf we do not satisfy any of the covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2015.\nOur real estate leases also include various covenants, but typically do not include financial covenants. If we do not satisfy the covenants in the real estate leases, the leases may be terminated and we may be liable for damage claims. At December 31, 2015, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities and had not received any notices of default under any of our real estate leases.\nCredit Ratings\nOur borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.\nOur senior unsecured debt issued in 2014 and 2015, was rated BBB- (stable outlook) by Fitch and BBB- (stable outlook) by S&P. In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody's. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.\nLiquidity\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.\nWe maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of our Enterprise Risk Management Committee. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.\nWe maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at December 31, 2015 had $14.8 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to a $12.9 billion liquidity portfolio at December 31, 2014. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to debt financings, and also the retention of excess cash flows from operations within our Company.\nAs additional sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of $6.1 billion of undrawn committed capacity, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under two of our existing securitization programs, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.\nAs a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.\nWe will rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Regulation-We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness.\u201d and Regulation-Savings Association Regulation-Dividends and Stock Repurchases\u201d.\nCapital\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our businesses and existing equity capital. The proceeds from the IPO in 2014 also increased our equity capital significantly. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.\nOur capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. We maintain a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet, and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels. However, for regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets (i) are limited to the amount of taxes previously paid that a company could recover through loss carrybacks; and (ii) 10% of the amount of our Tier 1 capital. At December 31, 2015, no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes.\nThe Bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis, and beginning on January 1, 2017, the Company will be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the OCC's and the Federal Reserve Board's stress test regulations. The Bank is, and the Company will be, required to use stress-testing methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions. In addition, while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital planning rule, we prepare and submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board.\nDividend and Share Repurchases\nThe declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, capital and liquidity requirements of us and the Bank, regulatory restrictions, corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the Bank's ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Regulation-We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness\u201d.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial\nAs a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see Regulation-Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation\u201d.\nFor Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of December 31, 2015, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.\nThe following table sets forth at December 31, 2015 and 2014, the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III and Basel I regulatory capital standards, respectively.\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Basel III Transition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Basel I\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 risk-based capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 common equity\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total leveraged assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Basel III Fully Phased-in (estimated)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ in millions)\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe capital ratios presented above include common equity Tier 1 capital (\"CET1\") as calculated under the U.S. Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis, which is not currently required by our regulators to be disclosed and, as such, is considered to be a non-GAAP measure. In addition, we also present certain capital ratios for the Company at December 31, 2014, as calculated under the U.S. Basel I capital rules, which are also considered to be non-GAAP measures. We believe that these capital ratios are useful measures to investors because they are widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although these ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities, among other effects. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated and combined financial statements, which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nLosses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the portfolio. The method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data, trends and market factors.\nWe evaluate each portfolio quarterly. For credit card receivables, our estimation process includes analysis of historical data and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. Our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate. More specifically, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. We use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on non-delinquent accounts. The considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses, which compares this allowance for losses to projected net charge-offs over the next 12 months, in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance. We do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis, but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis. Further, experience is not available for new portfolios; therefore, while we are developing that experience, we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio. The underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process, which can result in changes to our assumptions. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. It is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates.\nAsset Impairment\nInvestments\nWe regularly review investment securities for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. For debt securities, if we do not intend to sell the security, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost, we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists, such as the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer, including whether the issuer is in compliance with the terms and covenants of the security. Quantitative criteria include determining whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows. For equity securities, our criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe do not amortize goodwill but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined under GAAP as the operating segment, or one level below that operating segment (the component level) if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. Our operating segment consists of a single reporting unit, based on the level at which management regularly reviews and measures the business operating results.\nGoodwill impairment risk is first assessed under FASB Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment by performing a qualitative review of entity-specific, industry, market and general economic factors for our reporting unit. If potential goodwill impairment risk exists that indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we apply a two-step quantitative test. The first step compares the reporting unit's estimated fair value with its carrying value. If the carrying value of our reporting unit's net assets exceeds its fair value, the second step is applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the goodwill is considered impaired and reduced to its implied fair value. The qualitative assessment for each period presented in the consolidated and combined financial statements was performed without hindsight, assuming only factors and market conditions existing as of those dates, and resulted in no potential goodwill impairment risk for our reporting unit. Consequently, goodwill was not deemed to be impaired for any of the periods presented.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of customer-related assets, including contract acquisitions and purchased credit card relationships. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation compares the cash inflows expected to be generated from each intangible asset to its carrying value. If cash flows attributable to the intangible asset are less than the carrying value, the asset is considered impaired and written down to its estimated fair value. No impairments of definite-lived intangible assets have been recognized in the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States (federal, state and local) as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our provision for income tax expense is based on our income, the statutory tax rates and other provisions of the tax laws applicable to us in each of these various jurisdictions. These laws are complex and their application to our facts is at times open to interpretation. The process of determining our consolidated income tax expense includes significant judgments and estimates, including judgments regarding the interpretation of those laws. Our provision for income taxes and our deferred tax assets and liabilities incorporate those judgments and estimates and reflect management's best estimate of current and future income taxes to be paid. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities relate to temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of our assets and liabilities, as well as the impact of tax loss carryforwards or carrybacks, and are measured using the enacted income tax laws and rates that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are specific to the jurisdiction in which they arise and are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization of those assets is more likely than not. In making decisions regarding our ability to realize tax assets, we evaluate all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, taxable income in carryback periods, expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the implementation of available tax planning strategies. These decisions rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-range business forecasts to provide insight.\nASC 740, Income Taxes, establishes the framework by which we determine the appropriate level of tax reserves to be maintained for uncertain income tax positions. Applying this framework, we recognize the financial statement impact of uncertain income tax positions when we conclude that it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of a position, that the position will be sustained upon examination. In certain situations, we establish a liability that represents the difference between a tax position taken (or expected to be taken) on an income tax return and the amount of taxes recognized in our financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities. Assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period, but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances primarily include loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired.\nAssets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. A fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.\nNew Accounting Standards\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated and combined financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest. The ASU changes the financial statement presentation of debt issuance costs from being presented as an asset to a direct reduction to the carrying amount of the long-term debt. The amortization of debt issuance costs will continue to be included in interest expense. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We are currently evaluating the effect of the ASU on our consolidated and combined financial statements.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of a consumer financial services company in the United States.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction and Business Overview\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United States. We provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our partners\u201d. During 2015, we financed $113.6 billion of purchase volume, and at December 31, 2015, we had $68.3 billion of loan receivables and 68.3 million active accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net earnings of $2.2 billion, representing a return on assets of 2.9%.\nWe offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Synchrony Bank (the \"Bank\"). Through the Bank, we offer a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d). We are continuing to expand our direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. We had $43.4 billion in deposits at December 31, 2015.\nOur Separation from GE\nOn October 14, 2015, we received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board\u201d) to become a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, to retain control of the Bank and to retain control of our nonbank subsidiaries following the completion of GE's offer to exchange shares of GE common stock for all of our shares of our common stock owned by GE (the exchange offer\u201d). On November 17, 2015, we announced the completion of the exchange offer and our separation from GE (the \"Separation\"). Following the Separation, GE no longer owns any of our outstanding common stock.\nOur Sales Platforms\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our operations are within the United States. We offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit). Those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are measured on platform revenue, loan receivables, new accounts and other sales metrics. See Item 1. Business-Our Sales Platforms.\u201d\n______________________\n (1) For a definition of platform revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, and its reconciliation to interest and fees on loans, see Results of Operations-Platform Analysis-Non-GAAP Measure\u201d.  Retail Card\nRetail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. We offer one or more of these products primarily through 22 national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements. The average length of our relationship with these Retail Card partners is 17 years. Retail Card's platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, plus other income, less retailer share arrangements. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on Dual Card transactions (when the card is used outside of our partners' sales channels) and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms.\nPayment Solutions\nPayment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. At December 31, 2015, Payment Solutions offered these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. Payment Solutions' platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts,\u201d which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.\nCareCredit\nCareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. At December 31, 2015, we had a network of CareCredit providers that collectively have approximately 195,000 locations, the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers, through which we offer a CareCredit branded private label credit card. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. CareCredit's platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts.\nOur Credit Products\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nThrough our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. See Item 1. Business - Our Credit Products.\u201d\nCredit Cards\nWe offer two principal types of credit cards: private label credit cards and Dual Cards:\n \u2022 Private label credit cards. Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe's or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., CarCareONE or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In Retail Card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in Payment Solutions and CareCredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer. \n \u2022 Dual Cards. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. Credit extended under our Dual Cards typically is extended under standard terms only. Currently, only Retail Card offers Dual Cards. At December 31, 2015, we offered Dual Cards through 16 of our 22 active Retail Card programs.  Commercial Credit Products\nWe offer private label cards and co-branded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer our commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.\nInstallment Loans\nIn Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power product market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates.\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:\n \u2022 Growth in loan receivables and interest income. We believe continuing improvement in the U.S. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. In addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. We anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. In the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. Our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. In addition, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term, and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on interest-earning assets will remain relatively stable. \n \u2022 Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements. We have extended many of our largest Retail Card program agreements, and as a result, we expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis as indicated by the expiration schedule, which indicates for each period the number of programs scheduled to expire and the proportion of platform revenue that these programs comprised for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Business - Retail Card\u201d for additional information on the expiration of these programs.  A total of 17 of our 22 Retail Card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond. These 17 program agreements represented in the aggregate 89.7% of our Retail Card platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 91.6% of our Retail Card loan receivables at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Increases in retailer share arrangement payments and other expense under extended program agreements. We believe that as a result of both the overall growth of our programs, as well as amendments we have made to the terms of certain program agreements that we extended during 2015, the payments we make to our partners under these extended retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, are likely to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our net earnings. Overall, we expect our payments to our partners under our retailer share arrangements to grow generally in line with the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables.  In addition, under the terms of certain program agreements we have extended in recent years, we have agreed to dedicate increased marketing expense and other investments to promote these programs. We expect to benefit from these increased payments and other expenses, as they will create additional incentives for our partners to support their programs and, in the case of increased marketing expense and other investments, directly promote these programs, all of which we expect will have a positive impact on purchase volume and result in higher loan receivables and increased interest and fees on loans. We also expect to benefit from the extended duration of our amended program agreements.\n \u2022 Stable asset quality. Our credit performance continued to improve through 2015. Our net charge-off rates decreased to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our over-30 day delinquency rate decreased to 4.06% at December 31, 2015 from 4.14% at December 31, 2014, which are lower year-end levels than we experienced immediately prior to the financial crisis in 2007. In the near term, we expect the U.S. employment rate to continue to stabilize, and we do not anticipate making significant changes to our underwriting standards. Accordingly, we expect our charge-off rates to remain relatively stable in the near term. Provision for loan losses increased slightly by $35 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as the growth in loan receivables was partially offset by the benefit from improving asset quality trends. As the credit environment stabilizes, we do not believe this benefit will repeat in the near term and expect that our provision for loan losses will increase at a higher rate than we experienced in 2015, primarily driven by our receivables growth. \n \u2022 Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners' locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. Overall, we expect both our interchange revenues and loyalty program costs to grow in excess of the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables, and expect the increase in loyalty program costs to be higher than that expected for interchange revenues due to the additional loyalty programs for our private label credit cards. These increases have been contemplated in our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements. \n \u2022 Impact of regulatory developments. Our business and the consumer financial services industry continues to be subject to regulation from various regulatory authorities, including the CFPB, which was established through the Dodd Frank Act. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $9 million, $26 million and $133 million, respectively, in expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters. The expenses incurred in 2013, primarily related to an increase to our reserve for the matters settled with the CFPB and the DOJ in late 2013 and 2014. See Item 1. Business-Regulation-Consumer Financial Services Regulation.\u201d \n \u2022 Capital and liquidity levels. We expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. Following the Separation, we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by, among other things, retaining net earnings and not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until we have the non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to do so. Our board of directors intends to establish dividends and share repurchases programs, in each case consistent with maintaining capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Company had an estimated fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.9%. We also expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives. \nSeasonality\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.\nThe seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.\nIn addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.\nResults of Operations\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nKey Earnings Metrics\nGrowth Metrics\nAsset Quality Metrics\nCapital and Liquidity\n______________________\n (a) Represents Tier 1 common equity calculated under Basel I regulatory capital standards, see Item 7. -Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital-Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d (b) Calculated under Basel III regulatory capital standards, subject to transition provisions. \nHighlights for Year Ended December 31, 2015\nBelow are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.\n \u2022 Net earnings increased 5.0% to $2,214 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangements, provision for loan losses and other expenses. \n \u2022 Loan receivables increased 11.4% to $68,290 million at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth, and included growth associated with the BP portfolio acquired in the second quarter of 2015. \n \u2022 Net interest income increased 6.8% to $12,093 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher average loan receivables, partially offset by higher interest expense driven by increased liquidity, funding mix and growth. \n \u2022 Retailer share arrangements increased 6.3% to $2,738 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs. \n \u2022 Loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.06% at December 31, 2015 from 4.14% at December 31, 2014, primarily driven by improving asset quality trends and general improvement in the U.S. economy. Net charge-off rates decreased 18 basis points to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflecting these same trends. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses increased by $35 million, or 1.2%, to $2,952 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to portfolio growth, partially offset by improving asset quality trends. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percent of end of period loan receivables) decreased to 5.12% at December 31, 2015, as compared to 5.28% at December 31, 2014, reflecting the recent improvements in our asset quality trends. \n \u2022 Other expense increased by $337 million, or 11.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by investments in growth and infrastructure build in preparation for separation from GE and also included expenses for the completion of the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card accounts. \n \u2022 We continue to invest in our direct banking activities to grow our deposit base. Total deposits increased 24.3% to $43.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits of 50.8% to $29.7 billion, partially offset by a reduction in our brokered deposits.  New and Extended Partner Agreements\n \u2022 We extended our Retail Card program agreements with Amazon, Chevron, Dick's Sporting Goods and PayPal, launched our new program with BP, and announced our new partnerships with Citgo and Stash Hotel Rewards. \n \u2022 We entered into new program agreements in our Payment Solutions sales platform with Guitar Center, Mattress Firm, The Container Store and Newegg and extended our program agreements with Discount Tire, Sleepy's, P.C. Richard & Son, Conn's, Polaris Industries, Mohawk Flooring, Art Van Furniture and MEGA Group USA, a national home furnishings buying group of independent retailers. \n \u2022 In our CareCredit sales platform, we added Rite Aid to our network of providers, added a new endorsement with VSP, the nation's largest vision insurance provider, and renewed our endorsement with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2014\nBelow are highlights of our performance in 2014. These highlights generally are based on a comparison between our 2014 and 2013 results, except as otherwise noted.\n \u2022 Net earnings increased 6.6% to $2,109 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by higher net interest income and a reduction in our provision for loan losses, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangements and other expenses. \n \u2022 Loan receivables increased 7.0% to $61,286 million at December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth. \n \u2022 Net interest income increased 7.1% to $11,320 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to higher average loan receivables. \n \u2022 Retailer share arrangements increased 8.5% to $2,575 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of improved performance, and the growth of the programs in which we had retailer share arrangements, as well as from changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in late 2013 and in 2014. \n \u2022 Loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.14% at December 31, 2014 from 4.35% at December 31, 2013, driven by continued improvement in the U.S. economy and employment rates. Net charge-off rates decreased to 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 4.68% for the year ended December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses decreased by $155 million, or 5.0%, to $2,917 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of $642 million recorded during 2013 relating to the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology, which was not repeated in 2014. This decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily driven by portfolio growth. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percent of end of period loan receivables) increased to 5.28% at December 31, 2014, as compared to 5.05% at December 31, 2013, reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at December 31, 2014 from an improving outlook at December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 Other expense increased to $2,927 million from $2,484 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, driven by business growth, increased marketing investments and incremental costs associated with building our stand-alone infrastructure. \n \u2022 We completed our IPO, resulting in the issuance of a total of 128.5 million shares of our common stock, and entered into our new debt financings, which increased our indebtedness with third parties and reduced our funding from GECC. The net proceeds from these transactions increased our liquidity portfolio by $7.3 billion. Our liquidity portfolio, including undrawn credit facilities, was $19.0 billion at December 31, 2014. \n \u2022 We invested in our direct banking activities to grow our deposit base. Total deposits increased 35.9% to $35.0 billion at December 31, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013, driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits of 79.1% to $19.7 billion at December 31, 2014.  New and Extended Partner Agreements\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we extended five program agreements in Retail Card (American Eagle, Gap, Lowe's, QVC and Sam's Club), and in February 2015, we extended our program agreement with Amazon. These programs represented, in the aggregate $22.2 billion in loan receivables at December 31, 2014. Program agreements with three Retail Card partners representing $0.5 billion in loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, at December 31, 2014, were not renewed. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with BP, for a Retail Card program which commenced in May 2015, and which became one of our 20 largest program agreements. \n \u2022 In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we increased the number of participating partners in our network by over 2,000 partners, compared to the number of partners at December 31, 2013. In our CareCredit network, we increased the number of provider locations by over 9,000 locations, compared to the number of locations at December 31, 2013.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nIntroduction and Business Overview\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United States. We provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our partners\u201d. During 2015, we financed $113.6 billion of purchase volume, and at December 31, 2015, we had $68.3 billion of loan receivables and 68.3 million active accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had net earnings of $2.2 billion, representing a return on assets of 2.9%.\nWe offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Synchrony Bank (the \"Bank\"). Through the Bank, we offer a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC\u201d). We are continuing to expand our direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. We had $43.4 billion in deposits at December 31, 2015.\nOur Separation from GE\nOn October 14, 2015, we received approval from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board\u201d) to become a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, to retain control of the Bank and to retain control of our nonbank subsidiaries following the completion of GE's offer to exchange shares of GE common stock for all of our shares of our common stock owned by GE (the exchange offer\u201d). On November 17, 2015, we announced the completion of the exchange offer and our separation from GE (the \"Separation\"). Following the Separation, GE no longer owns any of our outstanding common stock.\nOur Sales Platforms\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our operations are within the United States. We offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit). Those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are measured on platform revenue, loan receivables, new accounts and other sales metrics. See Item 1. Business-Our Sales Platforms.\u201d\n______________________\n (1) For a definition of platform revenue, which is a non-GAAP measure, and its reconciliation to interest and fees on loans, see Results of Operations-Platform Analysis-Non-GAAP Measure\u201d.  Retail Card\nRetail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. We offer one or more of these products primarily through 22 national and regional retailers with which we have ongoing program agreements. The average length of our relationship with these Retail Card partners is 17 years. Retail Card's platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, plus other income, less retailer share arrangements. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on Dual Card transactions (when the card is used outside of our partners' sales channels) and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard terms.\nPayment Solutions\nPayment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. At December 31, 2015, Payment Solutions offered these products through participating partners consisting of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. Payment Solutions' platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts,\u201d which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.\nCareCredit\nCareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. At December 31, 2015, we had a network of CareCredit providers that collectively have approximately 195,000 locations, the vast majority of which are individual or small groups of independent healthcare providers, through which we offer a CareCredit branded private label credit card. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is promotional financing. CareCredit's platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including merchant discounts.\nOur Credit Products\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nThrough our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. See Item 1. Business - Our Credit Products.\u201d\nCredit Cards\nWe offer two principal types of credit cards: private label credit cards and Dual Cards:\n \u2022 Private label credit cards. Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe's or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., CarCareONE or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In Retail Card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in Payment Solutions and CareCredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer. \n \u2022 Dual Cards. Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners and as general purpose credit cards when used elsewhere. Credit extended under our Dual Cards typically is extended under standard terms only. Currently, only Retail Card offers Dual Cards. At December 31, 2015, we offered Dual Cards through 16 of our 22 active Retail Card programs.  Commercial Credit Products\nWe offer private label cards and co-branded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer our commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.\nInstallment Loans\nIn Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power product market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. Installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates.\nBusiness Trends and Conditions\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:\n \u2022 Growth in loan receivables and interest income. We believe continuing improvement in the U.S. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. In addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. We anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. In the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. Our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. In addition, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term, and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on interest-earning assets will remain relatively stable. \n \u2022 Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements. We have extended many of our largest Retail Card program agreements, and as a result, we expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis as indicated by the expiration schedule, which indicates for each period the number of programs scheduled to expire and the proportion of platform revenue that these programs comprised for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Business - Retail Card\u201d for additional information on the expiration of these programs.  A total of 17 of our 22 Retail Card program agreements now have an expiration date in 2019 or beyond. These 17 program agreements represented in the aggregate 89.7% of our Retail Card platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 91.6% of our Retail Card loan receivables at December 31, 2015.\n \u2022 Increases in retailer share arrangement payments and other expense under extended program agreements. We believe that as a result of both the overall growth of our programs, as well as amendments we have made to the terms of certain program agreements that we extended during 2015, the payments we make to our partners under these extended retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, are likely to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our net earnings. Overall, we expect our payments to our partners under our retailer share arrangements to grow generally in line with the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables.  In addition, under the terms of certain program agreements we have extended in recent years, we have agreed to dedicate increased marketing expense and other investments to promote these programs. We expect to benefit from these increased payments and other expenses, as they will create additional incentives for our partners to support their programs and, in the case of increased marketing expense and other investments, directly promote these programs, all of which we expect will have a positive impact on purchase volume and result in higher loan receivables and increased interest and fees on loans. We also expect to benefit from the extended duration of our amended program agreements.\n \u2022 Stable asset quality. Our credit performance continued to improve through 2015. Our net charge-off rates decreased to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014, and our over-30 day delinquency rate decreased to 4.06% at December 31, 2015 from 4.14% at December 31, 2014, which are lower year-end levels than we experienced immediately prior to the financial crisis in 2007. In the near term, we expect the U.S. employment rate to continue to stabilize, and we do not anticipate making significant changes to our underwriting standards. Accordingly, we expect our charge-off rates to remain relatively stable in the near term. Provision for loan losses increased slightly by $35 million, or 1.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as the growth in loan receivables was partially offset by the benefit from improving asset quality trends. As the credit environment stabilizes, we do not believe this benefit will repeat in the near term and expect that our provision for loan losses will increase at a higher rate than we experienced in 2015, primarily driven by our receivables growth. \n \u2022 Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners' locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. Overall, we expect both our interchange revenues and loyalty program costs to grow in excess of the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables, and expect the increase in loyalty program costs to be higher than that expected for interchange revenues due to the additional loyalty programs for our private label credit cards. These increases have been contemplated in our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements. \n \u2022 Impact of regulatory developments. Our business and the consumer financial services industry continues to be subject to regulation from various regulatory authorities, including the CFPB, which was established through the Dodd Frank Act. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $9 million, $26 million and $133 million, respectively, in expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters. The expenses incurred in 2013, primarily related to an increase to our reserve for the matters settled with the CFPB and the DOJ in late 2013 and 2014. See Item 1. Business-Regulation-Consumer Financial Services Regulation.\u201d \n \u2022 Capital and liquidity levels. We expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. Following the Separation, we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by, among other things, retaining net earnings and not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until we have the non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to do so. Our board of directors intends to establish dividends and share repurchases programs, in each case consistent with maintaining capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2015, the Company had an estimated fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.9%. We also expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives. \nSeasonality\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.\nThe seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.\nIn addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.\nResults of Operations\n____________________________________________________________________________________________\nKey Earnings Metrics\nGrowth Metrics\nAsset Quality Metrics\nCapital and Liquidity\n______________________\n (a) Represents Tier 1 common equity calculated under Basel I regulatory capital standards, see Item 7. -Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital-Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d (b) Calculated under Basel III regulatory capital standards, subject to transition provisions. \nHighlights for Year Ended December 31, 2015\nBelow are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.\n \u2022 Net earnings increased 5.0% to $2,214 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangements, provision for loan losses and other expenses. \n \u2022 Loan receivables increased 11.4% to $68,290 million at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth, and included growth associated with the BP portfolio acquired in the second quarter of 2015. \n \u2022 Net interest income increased 6.8% to $12,093 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher average loan receivables, partially offset by higher interest expense driven by increased liquidity, funding mix and growth. \n \u2022 Retailer share arrangements increased 6.3% to $2,738 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, partially offset with increased other expense and loyalty costs associated with these programs. \n \u2022 Loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.06% at December 31, 2015 from 4.14% at December 31, 2014, primarily driven by improving asset quality trends and general improvement in the U.S. economy. Net charge-off rates decreased 18 basis points to 4.33% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflecting these same trends. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses increased by $35 million, or 1.2%, to $2,952 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to portfolio growth, partially offset by improving asset quality trends. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percent of end of period loan receivables) decreased to 5.12% at December 31, 2015, as compared to 5.28% at December 31, 2014, reflecting the recent improvements in our asset quality trends. \n \u2022 Other expense increased by $337 million, or 11.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2015, driven by investments in growth and infrastructure build in preparation for separation from GE and also included expenses for the completion of the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card accounts. \n \u2022 We continue to invest in our direct banking activities to grow our deposit base. Total deposits increased 24.3% to $43.4 billion at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014, driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits of 50.8% to $29.7 billion, partially offset by a reduction in our brokered deposits.  New and Extended Partner Agreements\n \u2022 We extended our Retail Card program agreements with Amazon, Chevron, Dick's Sporting Goods and PayPal, launched our new program with BP, and announced our new partnerships with Citgo and Stash Hotel Rewards. \n \u2022 We entered into new program agreements in our Payment Solutions sales platform with Guitar Center, Mattress Firm, The Container Store and Newegg and extended our program agreements with Discount Tire, Sleepy's, P.C. Richard & Son, Conn's, Polaris Industries, Mohawk Flooring, Art Van Furniture and MEGA Group USA, a national home furnishings buying group of independent retailers. \n \u2022 In our CareCredit sales platform, we added Rite Aid to our network of providers, added a new endorsement with VSP, the nation's largest vision insurance provider, and renewed our endorsement with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2014\nBelow are highlights of our performance in 2014. These highlights generally are based on a comparison between our 2014 and 2013 results, except as otherwise noted.\n \u2022 Net earnings increased 6.6% to $2,109 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, driven by higher net interest income and a reduction in our provision for loan losses, partially offset by increases in retailer share arrangements and other expenses. \n \u2022 Loan receivables increased 7.0% to $61,286 million at December 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013, primarily driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth. \n \u2022 Net interest income increased 7.1% to $11,320 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to higher average loan receivables. \n \u2022 Retailer share arrangements increased 8.5% to $2,575 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of improved performance, and the growth of the programs in which we had retailer share arrangements, as well as from changes to the terms of the retailer share arrangements for those partners with whom we extended program agreements in late 2013 and in 2014. \n \u2022 Loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased with the over-30 day delinquency rate decreasing to 4.14% at December 31, 2014 from 4.35% at December 31, 2013, driven by continued improvement in the U.S. economy and employment rates. Net charge-off rates decreased to 4.51% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 4.68% for the year ended December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 Provision for loan losses decreased by $155 million, or 5.0%, to $2,917 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was driven primarily as a result of an incremental provision of $642 million recorded during 2013 relating to the enhancements to our allowance for loan loss methodology, which was not repeated in 2014. This decrease was partially offset by increased provisions in 2014 primarily driven by portfolio growth. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for loan losses as a percent of end of period loan receivables) increased to 5.28% at December 31, 2014, as compared to 5.05% at December 31, 2013, reflecting a transition to a stable credit outlook at December 31, 2014 from an improving outlook at December 31, 2013. \n \u2022 Other expense increased to $2,927 million from $2,484 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, driven by business growth, increased marketing investments and incremental costs associated with building our stand-alone infrastructure. \n \u2022 We completed our IPO, resulting in the issuance of a total of 128.5 million shares of our common stock, and entered into our new debt financings, which increased our indebtedness with third parties and reduced our funding from GECC. The net proceeds from these transactions increased our liquidity portfolio by $7.3 billion. Our liquidity portfolio, including undrawn credit facilities, was $19.0 billion at December 31, 2014. \n \u2022 We invested in our direct banking activities to grow our deposit base. Total deposits increased 35.9% to $35.0 billion at December 31, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013, driven primarily by growth in our direct deposits of 79.1% to $19.7 billion at December 31, 2014.  New and Extended Partner Agreements\n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we extended five program agreements in Retail Card (American Eagle, Gap, Lowe's, QVC and Sam's Club), and in February 2015, we extended our program agreement with Amazon. These programs represented, in the aggregate $22.2 billion in loan receivables at December 31, 2014. Program agreements with three Retail Card partners representing $0.5 billion in loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, at December 31, 2014, were not renewed. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with BP, for a Retail Card program which commenced in May 2015, and which became one of our 20 largest program agreements. \n \u2022 In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we increased the number of participating partners in our network by over 2,000 partners, compared to the number of partners at December 31, 2013. In our CareCredit network, we increased the number of provider locations by over 9,000 locations, compared to the number of locations at December 31, 2013.
