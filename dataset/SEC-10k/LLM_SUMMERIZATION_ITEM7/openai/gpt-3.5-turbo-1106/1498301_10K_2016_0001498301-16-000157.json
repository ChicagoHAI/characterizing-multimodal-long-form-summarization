(the \"ANN Acquisition\"), a retailer of women's apparel, shoes and accessories sold primarily under the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. The purchase price consisted of approximately $1.75 billion in cash and the issuance of 31.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $345 million, based on the Company's stock price on the date of the acquisition, as more fully described in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with borrowings under a $1.8 billion seven-year, variable-rate term loan described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The acquisition is intended to diversify our portfolio of brands that serve the needs of women of different ages, sizes and demographics. ANN's operating results for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016 are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for Fiscal 2016.\nEnterprise-wide Transformation Project\nIn the second half of Fiscal 2016, the Company engaged a leading global professional services company to assess the Company's operations and identify and review strategic initiatives to support our long-term growth. In August 2016, we completed the initial benchmarking phase of our engagement and are in the process of selecting and planning workstreams to address opportunities\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nwith efficiency as well as enterprise capabilities. The operational assessment is expected to continue during the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. As a result, the Company is unable to estimate the financial impact of the project at this time.\nObjectives and Initiatives\nOur core strengths include a portfolio of value-oriented, lifestyle brands serving the female customer at various levels of maturity and sizes. This portfolio of brands is well-complemented by a strong and experienced management team and a disciplined investment philosophy. Despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow.\nOver the past few years, we have identified a number of ongoing key initiatives aimed at positioning the Company for enhanced growth and value creation by increasing our profitability through comparable sales growth, gross margin rate improvement and expense rate leverage resulting from synergies achieved through integration of newly acquired businesses. We remain committed to our long-term growth initiatives and ongoing expense management discipline. While dilutive to our earnings in the short-term, we continue to expect that the investments we have completed will create long-term shareholder value.\nThese objectives and initiatives include, but are not limited to, the following:\nDistribution and Fulfillment\nAs previously disclosed, our Justice, Lane Bryant, maurices, dressbarn and Catherines (\"legacy\") brands' distribution and fulfillment was centralized during Fiscal 2015 into our brick-and-mortar store distribution facility in Etna, Ohio and our ecommerce fulfillment facility in Greencastle, Indiana which has resulted in a reduction of our per-unit processing cost. Additionally, the Company completed the integration of ANN's ecommerce fulfillment into our Greencastle facility in August 2016 and is in the process of consolidating ANN's brick-and-mortar distribution from Louisville into our Etna facility. The Etna consolidation is expected to be completed during Fiscal 2017.\nDuring Fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a ten-year lease for a 583,000 square foot distribution center in Riverside, California to serve as the receiving and west coast distribution hub for the Company's merchandise coming from Asia. The Riverside facility is expected to begin operations during Fiscal 2017.\nWe believe that the integration of ANN's distribution operations into Etna and Greencastle and the opening of the Riverside distribution center will result in a further reduction of our per-unit processing cost.\nTransportation\nDuring Fiscal 2017, with the addition of ANN, we expect to continue to realize savings associated with our shipping contracts. These savings will be enabled as a result of the centralization of our brands' distribution and fulfillment activity.\nSourcing\nThe Company's brands source their products through a variety of sourcing channels. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.\nWe have internal sourcing operations under the name Ascena Global Sourcing (\"AGS\"). During Fiscal 2016, we continued our investment in personnel at AGS, and within the merchandising and design function at certain of our brands. Additionally, the Company currently sources some of its merchandise through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia.\nNon-merchandise Procurement\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we continued our efforts to leverage our volume of non-merchandise related goods and services purchases to negotiate favorable pricing. As part of these efforts, we are consolidating suppliers of our brands across multiple areas, including information technology support contracts, facilities, marketing arrangements, and general services and suppliers, among others.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOmni-channel Expansion\nWe continue to invest in our technology platforms to support the growth of our omni-channel strategy, with different brands at different stages of implementation. ANN launched the first phase of their omni-channel initiative in calendar 2012 and has added various enhancements and functionalities since then. Justice and maurices launched their new ecommerce platforms in Fiscal 2016 and we expect other brands to roll onto these platforms in Fiscal 2017. Our ecommerce platforms allow the brands to (i) enhance the customer shopping experience inside and outside our stores, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to collect and analyze customer transaction data to support strategic decisions.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur individual segments are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back-to-school shopping periods. In particular, sales at Justice tend to be significantly higher during the fall season, which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, as this includes the back-to-school period and the December holiday season. Our Lane Bryant, dressbarn, and Catherines segments tend to experience higher sales during the spring season, which include the Easter and Mother's Day holidays. Our ANN and maurices segments have relatively balanced sales across the Fall and Spring seasons. As a result, our operational results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels and patterns of consumer spending. Some of the factors that could negatively impact discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, reductions in net worth, higher energy and other prices, increasing interest rates and low consumer confidence. These factors above could have a negative effect on our operations, which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe U.S. economy continued to show mixed signs of recovery during Fiscal 2016. Within the retail sector, consumer sentiment in certain industries such as automotive and home improvements was generally positive, while the apparel industry appeared to be more challenging and inconsistent from month-to-month and company-to-company. Uncertainty around the U.S. Presidential election and the mixed economic environment could cause inconsistent sales trends to continue through the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. Our brands will continue to monitor the respective spending patterns of their consumers and adjust their operating strategies as necessary to mitigate these challenges and maximize operating performance.\nOmni-channel Strategy\nAs our omni-channel strategy continues to mature, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between store sales and ecommerce sales due to the following:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Stores increase ecommerce sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Particular colors or sizes of merchandise not available in a store can be ordered online by our store associates and shipped from our ecommerce fulfillment center or another store directly to the customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our websites increase store sales as in-store customers have often pre-shopped online before shopping in the store, including verification of which stores have merchandise in stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ecommerce sales can be returned to our stores, creating mismatches between revenues and returns between the two channels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increased integration of brand specific merchandise planning, procurement and allocation functions serving stores and ecommerce channels together; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The Company's marketing and loyalty programs become increasingly integrated to maintain customer relationship and improve traffic and conversion rate both in-store and online.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nWe believe our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales, and as a result, we only report combined comparable sales. Effective with the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, we ceased reporting store comparable sales and ecommerce sales separately.\nOperating Results\nOur Fiscal 2016 operating results reflected (i) ANN's operating income of $13.3 million for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016, including approximately $165 million of purchase accounting adjustments; (ii) improved operating results at Justice; (iii) Acquisition and integration expenses and (iv) a challenging retail environment with inconsistent consumer spending patterns.\nIn order to mitigate the negative impacts on our operating performance, where possible, we continue to adjust our brands' operating strategies including implementing the omni-channel strategy, refining inventory assortment, developing our hybrid sourcing model, leveraging our economies of scale and improving supply chain efficiencies.\nOperating highlights for Fiscal 2016 are as follows:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net sales for Fiscal 2016 increased $2.193 billion, or 45.6%, primarily due to the effect of the ANN Acquisition.

Net sales increased by $2.193 billion, or 45.6%, to $6.995 billion in Fiscal 2016 from $4.803 billion in Fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the ANN Acquisition. For the legacy ascena brands, on a consolidated basis, for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015, comparable sales decreased by $214.0 million, or 5%, to $4.233 billion from $4.447 billion mainly as a result of anticipated sales declines at Justice principally related to its new, less promotional selling model. Non-comparable sales decreased by $0.2 million, or essentially flat, to $206.0 million from $206.2 million. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues decreased by $6.6 million, or 4%, to $143.4 million from $150.0 million. Net sales for the legacy ascena brands also included incremental revenues of approximately $82 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales and comparable store sales data for our six business segments is presented below.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ANN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,330.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,330.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Justice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,276.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Lane Bryant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,095.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> maurices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,101.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,060.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> dressbarn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>993.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,023.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Catherines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,995.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,802.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,192.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable sales (a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and ecommerce sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in only stores open in the current period and comparative period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Ecommerce sales generally refer to growth of sales from the Company's ecommerce channel. The Company believes our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales and we no longer feel that separate ecommerce and brick-and-mortar sales information is meaningful. Considering our customer cross channel behaviors, we believe that reporting one comparable sales metric is a more meaningful presentation.\n(b) Sales for the newly acquired ANN segment and incremental revenues of approximately $82 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016 are excluded from the calculation of comparable sales.\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nANN net sales of $2.331 billion represented ANN's net sales for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016.\nJustice net sales performance primarily reflects:\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of $150.8 million, or 13%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016 mainly as a result of an anticipated decrease in customer transactions, which was caused by the less promotional selling model;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incremental revenues of $24.9 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $28.8 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 41 net store closures during Fiscal 2016;

Gross margin was negatively impacted in Fiscal 2016 by approximately $130 million of non-cash expenses for purchase accounting adjustments, primarily related to the amortization of the purchase accounting write-up of ANN's inventory to fair market value. The gross margin rate for the legacy ascena brands increased by 290 basis points from 55.6% to 58.5% primarily due to the less promotional selling model at Justice.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.\nBuying, Distribution and Occupancy (\"BD&O\") Expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses increased by $429.6 million, or 50.1%, to $1,286.5 million in Fiscal 2016 from $856.9 million in Fiscal 2015. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 60 basis points to 18.4% in Fiscal 2016 from 17.8% in Fiscal 2015. The increase in BD&O expenses was primarily attributable to the addition of $423.4 million related to ANN. The increase of $6.2 million from the legacy ascena brands was primarily due to increases in buying-related costs resulting from the expansion of merchandising and design functions, offset in part by synergy savings resulting from the supply chain integration of our ecommerce distribution facilities into one distribution center in Greencastle, Indiana that was completed in the third quarter of Fiscal 2015.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses increased by $621.4 million, or 41.7%, to $2.112 billion in Fiscal 2016 from $1.491 billion in Fiscal 2015. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 80 basis points to 30.2% in Fiscal 2016 from 31.0% in Fiscal 2015. The increase in SG&A expenses was due to the addition of $634.1 million related to ANN. The decrease of $12.7 million from the legacy ascena brands was primarily due to the establishment of a legal reserve in Fiscal 2015 of approximately $51 million in connection with the Justice pricing lawsuits in Fiscal 2015 and lower store-related expenses mainly at Justice, offset in part by incremental marketing investments mainly at Lane Bryant and maurices as well as general administrative increases.\nImpairment of Goodwill represents the impairment loss recognized during Fiscal 2015 to write down the carrying value of Lane Bryant's goodwill to its implied fair value, as more fully described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nImpairment of Intangible Assets represents the impairment loss recognized to write down the carrying value of the Lane Bryant trade name to its implied fair value during Fiscal 2015, as more fully described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense increased by $140.5 million, or 64.4%, to $358.7 million in Fiscal 2016 from $218.2 million in Fiscal 2015, with $128.0 million due to the addition of ANN. The remaining increase of $12.5 million from the legacy ascena brands primarily resulted from higher depreciation of Company-owned information technology assets placed into service during Fiscal 2015 offset in part by accelerated depreciation of $5.9 million for the store assets related to Brothers, which was completed in Fiscal 2015.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating results increased by $328.7 million, to an operating income of $93.8 million in Fiscal 2016 from an operating loss of $234.9 million in Fiscal 2015 primarily due to $306.4 million of impairment losses recognized during Fiscal 2015 at Lane Bryant to write down its goodwill and trade name to their respective fair values and the establishment of a legal reserve of approximately $51 million in connection with the Justice pricing lawsuits recognized during Fiscal 2015, offset in part by a $45.7 million increase in Acquisition and integration expenses in Fiscal 2016.

The operating results for Fiscal 2016 were impacted by approximately $165 million of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments.\nJustice operating results improved by $91.8 million. The operating results reflect a significant reduction in promotional activity, supported by execution of the new Justice strategy, which is based on a hybrid of everyday low price merchandise, along with full ticket fashion merchandise, supported by focused, category-level promotions. The decrease in sales for Fiscal 2016 was more than offset by an increase of approximately 980 basis points in gross margin rate resulting from an increased mix of full-ticket selling and tighter inventory management. BD&O and SG&A expenses decreased as a result of store closures related to ongoing market optimization and lower variable expenses associated with the decrease in sales volume. SG&A expenses also decreased due to the establishment of a legal reserve in Fiscal 2015 of approximately $51 million in connection with the Justice pricing lawsuits. Depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocated depreciation of Company-owned information technology assets placed into service during Fiscal 2015.\nLane Bryant operating results improved by $328.6 million primarily as a result of the $306.4 million of impairment losses recognized during Fiscal 2015 to write down the carrying values of the brand's goodwill and trade name to their fair values, as more fully described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The gross margin rate benefited from an increased internally-sourced product mix resulting in a higher mark-on, offset in part by higher promotional markdowns. BD&O and SG&A expenses were higher due to general administrative increases and strategic investments expected to drive future growth, including new stores and incremental marketing investments. Depreciation expense increased mainly due to higher allocated depreciation of Company-owned information technology assets placed into service during Fiscal 2015.\ndressbarn operating results decreased by $24.3 million mainly as an increase in gross margin rate was more than offset by lower sales volume and an increase in SG&A expenses. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily due to a higher mark-on and lower promotional markdowns resulting from tighter inventory management and reduced promotional selling. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to general administrative increases and higher store asset impairment charges resulting from lower-than-expected operating performance of certain retail locations.\nCatherines operating income decreased by $14.7 million mainly due to a reduced flow-through of margin dollars on a lower sales volume. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in allocated depreciation of Company-owned information technology assets placed into service during Fiscal 2015.\nUnallocated Acquisition and Integration Expenses of $77.4 million for Fiscal 2016 primarily represents costs related to the ANN acquisition consisting of $20.8 million of legal, consulting and investment banking-related transaction costs, $17.3 million of integration costs to combine the operations and infrastructures of the ANN business into the Company's and $37.5 million of severance and retention-related expenses. The $31.7 million for Fiscal 2015 related primarily to the Company's supply chain and technology integration, which was substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2015.\nInterest Expense increased by $97.3 million to $103.3 million for Fiscal 2016 as a result of the $1.8 billion seven-year, variable-rate term loan obtained to finance the ANN Acquisition on August 21, 2015. Interest expense included the non-cash amortization of $11.3 million related to the original issue discount and debt issuance costs.\nGain on extinguishment of debt. During Fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased $72.0 million of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan at an aggregate cost of $68.4 million through open market transactions, resulting in a $0.8 million pre-tax gain, net of the proportional write-off of unamortized original discount and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million.\n(Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision (benefit) for income taxes increased by $7.4 million, or 194.7%, to a provision of $3.6 million in Fiscal 2016 from a benefit of $3.8 million in Fiscal 2015. In Fiscal 2016, we had a pretax loss of $8.3 million, compared to a pretax loss of $240.6 million for Fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate was negative 43.4% for Fiscal 2016. The Company recorded a tax provision in Fiscal 2016 despite the net loss for the period primarily due to state and local taxes and certain expenses which are non-deductible for income tax purposes. The 1.6% effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 is lower than the Company's Federal statutory rate as a result of the goodwill impairment loss for Lane Bryant which was treated as a permanent non-deductible item, offset in part by an approximate $13 million tax benefit related to the retirement agreement for the former President and CEO of Justice whereby previously non-deductible permanent items for income tax purposes in previous fiscal years, became fully deductible in Fiscal 2015.\nNet Loss decreased by $224.9 million, or 95.0%, to $11.9 million in Fiscal 2016 from $236.8 million in Fiscal 2015, primarily due to a higher level of operating results as previously discussed, offset in part by an increase in acquisition and integration expenses and interest expense for Fiscal 2016.\nNet Loss per Diluted Common Share decreased by $1.40, or 95.9%, to $0.06 per share in Fiscal 2016 from $1.46 per share in Fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of the decrease in net loss,

Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in only stores open in the current period and comparative period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Ecommerce sales generally refer to growth of sales from the Company's ecommerce channel. The Company believes our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales and we no longer feel that separate ecommerce and brick-and-mortar sales information is meaningful. Considering our customer cross channel behaviors, we believe that reporting one comparable sales metric is a more meaningful presentation.\nJustice net sales performance primarily reflects:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of $118.1 million, or 10%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2015 mainly as a result of decreased store performance which was negatively impacted by reduced promotional activity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $16.7 million increase in non-comparable stores sales, as the positive effect of 30 new store openings was offset in part by 49 store closings in Fiscal 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $6.1 million decrease in wholesale, licensing operations and other revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLane Bryant net sales performance primarily reflects:\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $19.7 million, or 2%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $2.7 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 6 net store closures during Fiscal 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $1.1 million decrease in other revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nmaurices net sales performance primarily reflects:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $49.5 million, or 5%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $40.4 million increase in non-comparable stores sales, primarily driven by an increase related to 29 net new store openings in Fiscal 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $0.7 million decrease in other revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ndressbarn net sales performance primarily reflects:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease of $12.8 million, or 1%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an $11.3 million increase in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 4 net store openings in Fiscal 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $2.6 million increase in other revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCatherines net sales performance primarily reflects:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an increase of $15.8 million, or 5%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2015;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $4.2 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, primarily driven by a decrease related to 9 store closings in Fiscal 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a $2.0 million increase in other revenues.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Margin, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, was essentially flat, as higher margin rates at Lane Bryant, maurices and Catherines were offset by a lower margin rate at Justice.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.\nBuying, Distribution and Occupancy (\"BD&O\") Expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses increased by $24.6 million, or 3.0%, to $856.9 million in Fiscal 2015 from $832.3 million in Fiscal 2014. BD&O expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 40 basis points to 17.8% in Fiscal 2015 from 17.4% in Fiscal 2014. The increase in BD&O expenses, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, was primarily due to increases in buying-related costs resulting from the expansion of the merchandising and design functions throughout Fiscal 2014, higher store-occupancy costs, and higher fulfillment expense supporting the double-digit increase in ecommerce sales volume. Store occupancy costs were higher due to new store growth at maurices during the past twelve months, lease renewals, property taxes and other store-related costs. These increases in BD&O expenses were offset in part by synergy savings related to the supply chain integration at Etna, Ohio and Greencastle, Indiana.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expenses consist of compensation and benefit-related costs for sales and store operations personnel, administrative personnel and other employees not associated with the functions described above under BD&O expenses. SG&A expenses also include advertising and marketing costs, information technology and communication costs, supplies for our stores and administrative facilities, insurance costs, legal costs, and costs related to other administrative services.\nSG&A expenses increased by $114.6 million, or 8.3%, to $1.491 billion in Fiscal 2015 from $1.376 billion in Fiscal 2014. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 230 basis points to 31.0% in Fiscal 2015 from 28.7% in Fiscal 2014 as the dollar increases described below had a deleveraging effect when combined with the essentially flat sales. The increase in SG&A expenses was partly due to the establishment of a legal reserve of approximately $51 million in connection with the Justice pricing lawsuits. The remainder of the increase in SG&A expenses in terms of dollars was primarily due to (i) increases in store-related payroll costs and other store expenses resulting from the new store growth, (ii) higher marketing costs related to discrete marketing campaigns, (iii) higher administrative payroll costs, (iv) higher store asset impairment charges resulting from the lower-than-expected operating performance of certain retail locations, primarily at Justice and (v) higher expenses related to the Company's information technology initiatives, including ongoing support for our new merchandising system, point of sale system and ecommerce platforms.\nImpairment of Goodwill represents the impairment loss recognized during Fiscal 2015 to write down the carrying value of Lane Bryant's goodwill to its implied fair value, as more fully described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets represents the impairment loss recognized to write down the carrying value of the Lane Bryant trade name to its implied fair value during Fiscal 2015 and the impairment loss recognized to write off the entire carrying value of maurices' Studio Y trade name during Fiscal 2014, as more fully described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense increased by $24.6 million, or 12.7%, to $218.2 million in Fiscal 2015 from $193.6 million in Fiscal 2014.

Operating profit decreased by $445.7 million, to an operating loss of $234.9 million in Fiscal 2015 from operating income of $210.8 million in Fiscal 2014, primarily due to the $306.4 million of impairment losses recognized during Fiscal 2015 to write down the carrying values of Lane Bryant's goodwill and trade name to their respective fair values, the establishment of a legal reserve of approximately $51 million in connection with the Justice pricing lawsuits and a decrease in revenues and profitability at our Justice brand. These results are discussed in more detail on a brand-by-brand basis below.\nOperating results for our five business segments is presented below.\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 26,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Justice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(62.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(162.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(163.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Lane Bryant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(308.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,062.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> maurices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> dressbarn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(28.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Catherines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated acquisition and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(234.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(445.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(211.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nJustice operating results decreased by $162.1 million as a result of a decrease in sales, a 280 basis point decline in gross margin rate and increases in BD&O, SG&A and depreciation expenses. The decrease in gross margin rate was mainly attributable to aggressive promotional activity resulting from the negative sales trend experienced during Fiscal 2015. BD&O expenses increased largely as a result of higher store occupancy costs and higher fulfillment expense related to the ecommerce sales growth. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to the establishment of a legal reserve of approximately $51 million in connection with the Justice pricing lawsuits (see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements) and higher store asset impairment charges resulting from the lower-than-expected operating performance of certain retail locations, offset in part by a decrease in administrative-payroll costs related to incentive compensation. Depreciation expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocated depreciation of Company-owned facilities placed into service during the third quarter of Fiscal 2014 and accelerated depreciation of $5.9 million during the second half of Fiscal 2015 related to the closure of Brothers. In the latter part of Fiscal 2015, Justice began execution of a plan to stabilize and turnaround its business. The plan focused on (i) improving inventory management, (ii) shifting its marketing strategy with the aim to reduce the number of promotional offers and (iii) refining its inventory assortment.\nLane Bryant operating loss increased by $303.7 million primarily as a result of the $306.4 million of impairment losses recognized during Fiscal 2015 to write down the carrying values of the brand's goodwill and trade name to their fair values, as more fully described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Before the impact of the impairment charges, the operating loss decreased by $2.7 million as increases in sales and gross margin rate and a decrease in BD&O expenses were offset in part by increases in SG&A and depreciation expenses.\nmaurices operating income increased by $39.9 million as increases in sales and gross margin rate were offset in part by increases in BD&O, SG&A and depreciation expenses. The gross margin rate benefited from lower product costs achieved through sourcing more product internally and a decrease in promotional activity resulting from the strong positive sales trend. The increase in BD&O expenses was mainly due to increases in buying-related costs resulting from the expansion of the merchandising and design functions throughout Fiscal 2014, increases in store occupancy expenses, which resulted largely from new store growth, and higher fulfillment expense supporting the increase in ecommerce sales growth. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to an increase in store-related payroll and other costs resulting from the new store growth, as well as higher marketing costs related to\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nincreased digital marketing efforts to support the ecommerce growth. These factors were offset in part by synergy savings resulting from the integration of its ecommerce operations into the Company's distribution center in Greencastle, Indiana during the second half of Fiscal 2015. The increase in depreciation expense resulted mainly from new store growth and higher allocated depreciation of Company-owned facilities, which were placed into service during Fiscal 2014.\ndressbarn operating income decreased by $28.7 million primarily as a result of increases in BD&O, SG&A and depreciation expenses. BD&O expenses increased due to the expansion of the merchandising and design functions and an increase in store occupancy costs which resulted from higher rent associated with lease renewals, new stores and higher property taxes. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher marketing costs associated with its DRESSBAR marketing campaign during the second half of Fiscal 2015. The increase in depreciation expense resulted from higher allocated depreciation of Company-owned facilities, which were placed into service during Fiscal 2014.\nCatherines operating income increased by $6.6 million as an increase in sales and gross margin rate and a decrease in BD&O expenses were offset in part by an increase in SG&A expenses. The gross margin rate increased as a result of sourcing more products internally. The decrease in BD&O expenses, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales, resulted mainly from synergy savings from the supply chain integration. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher marketing costs and higher expenses related to the Company's information technology initiatives.\nUnallocated Acquisition and Integration Expenses of $31.7 million in Fiscal 2015 and $34.0 million in Fiscal 2014 related mainly to the Company's supply chain and technology integration efforts. During Fiscal 2015 we (i) completed the centralization of all of the legacy brands brick-and-mortar store distribution into one location in Etna, Ohio, (ii) completed the centralization of all of the legacy brands ecommerce fulfillment into one location in Greencastle, Indiana and (iii) principally completed the migration to our common information technology platforms for our legacy brands. The expenses for Fiscal 2015 also included $7.0 million of transaction costs incurred prior to the closing of the ANN Acquisition and represented legal, consulting and investment banking-related costs that were direct, incremental costs of the acquisition.\nInterest Expense decreased by $0.5 million, or 7.7%, to $6.0 million for Fiscal 2015 from $6.5 million for Fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of lower average borrowings outstanding and a lower effective interest rate during Fiscal 2015.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes from continuing operations decreased by $69.1 million, or 105.8%, to a benefit of $3.8 million in Fiscal 2015 from a provision of $65.3 million in Fiscal 2014, primarily as a result of a pretax loss of $240.6 million for Fiscal 2015, compared to a pretax income of $203.5 million for Fiscal 2014. The 1.6% effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 is lower than the Company's Federal statutory rate as a result of the goodwill impairment loss for Lane Bryant which was treated as a permanent non-deductible item, offset in part by an approximate $13 million tax benefit related to the retirement agreement for the former President and CEO of Justice whereby previously non-deductible permanent items for income tax purposes in previous fiscal years became fully deductible in Fiscal 2015. The 32.1% effective tax rate for Fiscal 2014 is lower than the Company's Federal statutory rate as a result of the Company's indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings related to our Canadian store expansion.\nNet (Loss) Income decreased by $370.2 million, or 277.5%, to a net loss of $236.8 million in Fiscal 2015 from net income of $133.4 million in Fiscal 2014, primarily due to a lower level of operating results as previously discussed, offset in part by a decrease in the provision for income taxes for Fiscal 2015.\nNet (Loss) Income per Diluted Common Share decreased by $2.27, or 280.2%, to a net loss of $1.46 per share in Fiscal 2015 from net income of $0.81 per share in Fiscal 2014 primarily as a result of the decrease in net income, as previously discussed.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nFinancial Condition\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>371.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>240.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term investments (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,648.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,542.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Net (debt) cash and investments (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,274.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,422.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,863.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,518.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>345.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Short-term investments include restricted cash of $1.8 million as of July 30, 2016 and $13.4 million as of July 25, 2015 which are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td> Net debt\u201d is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company is in a net debt position as of July 30, 2016, as compared to a net cash and investments position as of July 25, 2015. In addition to the ANN Acquisition debt, the change from July 25, 2015 was due to our use of cash to support our capital expenditures (as discussed below under \"Capital Spending\u201d). These factors were offset in part by our cash provided by operations during Fiscal 2016. The increase in equity was primarily due to the common shares issued in connection with the ANN Acquisition.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years presented as follows:\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>445.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,835.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,521.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $445.4 million for Fiscal 2016, compared with $431.3 million during Fiscal 2015. Cash provided by operations increased during Fiscal 2016 as higher net income before non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization expense, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and the amortization of the acquisition-related inventory write-up was mostly offset by an approximately $44 million payment made to a former Justice executive, an approximately $51 million escrow payment for the proposed Justice pricing litigation settlement and the payment of approximately $95 million of employee-related obligations assumed in the ANN Acquisition.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2016 was $1.836 billion, compared with $298.1 million for Fiscal 2015. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2016 consisted primarily of $1.495 billion of cash paid in the ANN Acquisition, net of cash acquired, and $366.5 million of capital expenditures, offset in part by $25.4 million of net proceeds from the sale of investments. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2015 was $298.1 million, consisting primarily of cash used for capital expenditures of $312.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $8.9 million and net proceeds from the sale of investments of $5.5 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.522 billion during Fiscal 2016, consisting primarily of $1.8 billion of borrowing under our new term loan, offset in part by net repayments of debt under\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nour amended revolving credit agreement of $116.0 million, $77.4 million of redemptions and principal repayments of our term loan debt and $42.6 million of payments made for deferred financing costs related to the new borrowing arrangements entered into during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016. Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2015 was $49.5 million, consisting primarily of $56.0 million of repayments of debt (net of borrowings) and proceeds relating to our stock-based compensation plans.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years presented as follows:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 26,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>431.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>374.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(462.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $431.3 million for Fiscal 2015, compared with $374.7 million during Fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by lower inventory purchases in Fiscal 2015 resulting from lower planned inventory levels, lower cash payments for income taxes and cash outflows in Fiscal 2014 associated with the discontinued operations. These factors were offset in part by lower net income before non-cash expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2015 was $298.1 million, compared with $462.7 million for Fiscal 2014. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2015 consisted primarily of cash used for capital expenditures of $312.5 million, offset in part by $8.9 million of proceeds from the sale of assets and net proceeds from the sale of investments of $5.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities in Fiscal 2014 was $462.7 million, consisting almost entirely of cash used for capital expenditures of $477.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $42.2 million.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $49.5 million during Fiscal 2015, consisting primarily of $56.0 million of repayments of debt (net of borrowings) and proceeds relating to our stock-based compensation plans. Net cash provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2014 was $58.5 million, consisting primarily of $36.4 million in borrowings of debt (net of repayments) and proceeds relating to our stock-based compensation plans.\nCapital Spending\nIn Fiscal 2016, we had $366.5 million in capital expenditures, which included both routine spending in connection with ongoing investments in our retail store network, construction and renovation of our existing portfolio of retail stores as well as spending for non-routine capital investments in our technology and supply chain infrastructure and investments in corporate office facilities to support our growing operations. The most significant non-routine initiatives are described below.\nDuring Fiscal 2016, the Company launched Justice and maurices onto their new ecommerce platforms in connection with our omni-channel initiative. The Company believes that this omni-channel initiative will enhance our customer's shopping experience across all of the Company's various shopping channels. These initiatives will allow the brands to (i) improve website and mobile functionality, (ii) improve product availability online, (iii) offer flexible customer loyalty programs and (iv) offer an enhanced customer service experience inside and outside our stores. This phased transition of brands onto the platforms is expected to continue through Fiscal 2017.\nIn addition, during Fiscal 2016, the Company (i) continued integration activity related to the ANN Acquisition, such as integration of their distribution operations into our existing network, (ii) leased and began fit-out of our new Riverside distribution center, (iii) completed our new maurices headquarters in Duluth, MN and (iv) completed our migration to common information technology platforms for its Company-wide point-of-sales systems, merchandise systems, warehouse management systems and financial systems.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nThe Company currently expects to begin operations at its new Riverside facility early in calendar 2017. Further, the Company expects the remaining incremental capital requirements for all of the projects discussed above to be approximately $75 million, which will be principally incurred during Fiscal 2017. Lastly, the Company expects that total capital spending for Fiscal 2017, including both routine spending and the projects discussed above, will be approximately $300 million. Our routine and non-routine capital requirements are expected to be funded primarily with available cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows and, to the extent necessary, borrowings under the Company's Amended Revolving Credit Agreement which is discussed below.\nLiquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from our operations, remaining availability under our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement after taking into account outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and the collateral limitation, available cash and cash equivalents and other available financing options. These sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, retail store expansion, construction and renovation of stores, any future dividend requirements, investment in technology and supply chain infrastructure, acquisitions, debt servicing requirements, stock repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to support our operating needs, capital requirements and any debt service requirements for the foreseeable future.\nAs of July 30, 2016, approximately $199 million, or 53%, of our available cash and cash equivalents was held overseas by our foreign subsidiaries. For the Company to have access to those cash and cash equivalents in the U.S, we would incur a current U.S. tax liability of between 15% to 20% of the cash repatriated. A U.S. tax liability has been previously provided for in the provision for income taxes for the portion that is not permanently reinvested as discussed in Note 13, and is currently classified within Deferred income taxes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We continue to assess options for the use of our overseas cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of July 30, 2016, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement. After taking into account the $25.9 million in outstanding letters of credit, the Company had $441.6 million of its availability under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nDebt\nIn connection with the ANN Acquisition, in August 2015, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Agreement (the \"Amended Revolving Credit Agreement\") and entered into a $1.8 billion seven-year term loan (the \"Term Loan\"). For a detailed description of the terms and restrictions under the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement and the Term Loan, see Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nAmended Revolving Credit Agreement\nWe believe that our Amended Revolving Credit Agreement is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. As of July 30, 2016 there were seven financial institutions participating in the Amended Revolving Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of 25%. Management has no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement in the event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Amended Revolving Credit Agreement as of July 30, 2016.\nTerm Loan\nDuring Fiscal 2016, the Company repurchased $72.0 million of the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan at an aggregate cost of $68.4 million through open market transactions, resulting in a $0.8 million pre-tax gain, net of the proportional write-off of unamortized original discount and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million. Such net gain has been recorded as Gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations. We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nthrough open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt arrangements, among other factors.\nIn addition to the repurchases discussed above, the Company made all scheduled quarterly principal payments in Fiscal 2016 totaling $9 million. Further, in August 2016, the Company repaid $100 million, which was applied to the remaining scheduled quarterly payments due in the second half of calendar 2016 and all scheduled payments for calendar 2017, such that the Company is not required to make its next quarterly scheduled payment until February 2018.\nThe Company expects to incur cash interest expense of approximately $85 million on the Term Loan during Fiscal 2017 based on the interest rates in effect as of July 30, 2016 and the outstanding balance after consideration of the $100 million repayment in August 2016. Such interest and principal payments are expected to be funded with our cash flows from operations.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn December 2015, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a $200 million share repurchase program (the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program\u201d), which replaced and canceled any outstanding share repurchase programs. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2016, 2.1 million shares of common stock were repurchased by the Company at an aggregate cost of $18.6 million under the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program. The remaining availability under the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program was approximately $181.4 million at July 30, 2016. Under the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, purchases of shares of common stock may be made at the Company's discretion from time to time, subject to overall business and market conditions. Currently, share repurchases in excess of $100 million are subject to certain restrictions under the terms of the Company's borrowing agreements, as more fully described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe may from time to time continue to repurchase additional shares depending on prevailing market conditions and our liquidity requirements, subject to any restrictions under our debt agreements, among other factors.\nCONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS\nFirm Commitments\nThe following table summarizes certain of the Company's aggregate contractual obligations as of July 30, 2016, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Company's liquidity and cash flows in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under its Amended Revolving Credit Agreement.\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2020-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2022\nand\nThereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,305.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,719.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>146.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>471.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>613.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>979.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>712.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>745.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,051.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>932.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>932.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,738.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,354.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,061.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,121.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,275.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a description of the Company's material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of July 30, 2016:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-term debt represents mandatory repayments of outstanding borrowings under our borrowing agreements as of July 30, 2016.

See Notes 14 and 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the Company's contingent commitments not included in the above table, including obligations under employment agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company's off-balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit amounted to approximately $25.9 million as of July 30, 2016. The Company does not maintain any other off-balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on its operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nThe Company is exposed to a variety of market-based risks, representing our potential exposure to losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. These market risks include, but are not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our Canadian operations, changes in interest rates, and changes in both the value and liquidity of our cash and cash equivalents. Consequently, in the normal course of business, we employ a number of established policies and procedures to manage such risks, including considering, at times, the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks. However, as a matter of policy, we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. As of the end of Fiscal 2016, the Company did not have any outstanding derivative financial instruments.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nWe currently do not have any significant risks to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates. Purchases of inventory for resale in our retail stores and ecommerce operations normally are transacted in U.S. dollars. In addition, our 100% owned international retail operations represent approximately 1% of our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2016. In the future, if our international operations continue to expand, we may consider the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage any significant risks to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nAs of July 30, 2016, our Company had $1.719 billion in variable-rate debt outstanding under our borrowing agreements. Accordingly, we remain subject to changes in interest rates. For each 0.125% increase or decrease in interest rates, the Company's interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately $2.1 million, and net income would decrease or increase, respectively, by approximately $1.3 million. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of the terms and conditions of our borrowing agreements.\nInvestment Risk Management\nAs of July 30, 2016, our Company had cash and cash equivalents of $371.8 million. The Company's short-term investments of $1.8 million included restricted cash.\nWe maintain cash deposits and cash equivalents with well-known and stable financial institutions; however, there were significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents on deposit at overseas financial institutions as well as FDIC-insured financial institutions that were in excess of FDIC-insured limits at the end of Fiscal 2016. This represents a concentration of credit risk. While there have been no losses recorded on deposits of cash and cash equivalents to date, we cannot be assured we will not experience losses on our deposits in the future.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe SEC's Financial Reporting Release No. 60, \"Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies\" (\"FRR 60\"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Company's operational results and financial position and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The Company's estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the Company's significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInventories\nRetail Inventory Method\nWe hold inventory for sale through our retail stores and ecommerce sites. All of the Company's segments, other than ANN discussed below, use the retail method of accounting, under which inventory is stated at the lower of cost, on a First In, First Out ( FIFO\u201d) basis, or market. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margin are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. Inherent in the retail method are certain significant management judgments and estimates including, among others, initial merchandise markup, markdowns and shrinkage, which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins.\nThe Company continuously reviews its inventory levels to identify slow-moving merchandise and markdowns necessary to clear slow-moving merchandise, which reduces the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value. Consideration is given to a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including current pricing levels and the anticipated need for subsequent markdowns, aging of inventories, historical sales trends, and the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates of markdown\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nrequirements may differ from actual results due to changes in quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, as well as changes in consumer preferences, market and economic conditions. The Company's historical estimates of these costs and its markdown provisions have not differed materially from actual results.\nReserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.\nWeighted-average Cost Method\nThe ANN segment uses the weighted-average cost method to value inventory, under which inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market, at the individual item level. Inventory cost is adjusted when the current selling price or future estimated selling price is less than cost.\nReserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk of physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values.\nGoodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill as described in Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company reviews and considers appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables.\nThe impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined using the relief-from-royalty approach. Estimating the fair value is judgmental in nature, and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge.\nFiscal 2016 Annual Impairment Assessment\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2016, the Company performed its annual impairment assessment (the \"Fiscal 2016 Valuation\"). While the fair values of Justice, maurices and Catherines were all significantly in excess of their respective book values, the fair value of the Company's Lane Bryant and ANN reporting units exceeded their book value by less than 20% and are discussed in more detail below.\nLane Bryant\nFor Lane Bryant, the Fiscal 2016 Valuation indicated that its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included: a weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") rate of 12.0% which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks; operating income margin of mid-to-high single digits and a terminal growth rate of 2%. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $60 million. A hypothetical 1% change in the operating income percentages in all periods would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $75 million. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the terminal growth rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $40 million.\nAdditionally, if we experience sustained periods of unexpected changes in consumer spending, it could adversely impact the long-term revenue assumptions used in our Fiscal 2016 Valuation. Such trends may have a negative impact on some of the other key assumptions used in the Fiscal 2016 Valuation, including anticipated gross margin and operating income margin as well as the WACC rate. These assumptions are highly judgmental and subject to change. Such changes, if material, may require us to incur impairment charges for goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets in future periods.\nANN\nFor the newly acquired ANN business, the Fiscal 2016 Valuation indicated that its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 12%.\nSignificant assumptions underlying the discounted cash flows included: a WACC rate of 11.5% which was determined from relevant market comparisons and adjusted for specific risks; operating income margin of mid-to-high single digits and a terminal growth rate of 2%. Material changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the valuation model. As an example, the impact of a hypothetical change in each of the significant assumptions is described below. In quantifying the impact, we changed only the specific assumption and held all other assumptions constant. A hypothetical 1% change in WACC rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $160 million. A hypothetical 1% change in the operating income percentages in all periods would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $175 million. Finally, a hypothetical 1% change in the terminal growth rate would increase/decrease the fair value by approximately $100 million.\nAdditionally, if we experience sustained periods of unexpected changes in consumer spending or are unable to realize the significant amount of synergies expected from the acquisition, it could adversely impact the long-term assumptions used in our Fiscal 2016 Valuation. Such trends may have a negative impact on some of the other key assumptions used in the Fiscal 2016 Valuation, including anticipated gross margin and operating income margin as well as the WACC rate. These assumptions are highly judgmental and subject to change. Such changes, if material, may require us to incur impairment charges for goodwill and/or other indefinite-lived intangible assets in future periods.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment, along with other long-lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating long-lived assets, including finite-lived intangible assets, for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of, and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nDuring Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $13.3 million, $10.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived tangible assets to their estimated fair\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nvalue. There have been no impairment losses recorded on the Company's finite-lived intangible assets for any of the periods presented. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nInsurance Reserves\nFor a complete discussion of the Company's underlying assumptions and judgments for insurance reserves, see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nStock Options\nStock options are granted to certain of its employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the expected forfeiture rate, the expected dividend yield and risk-free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from the actuals. Determining the fair value of stock-based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management, including estimates of the above Black-Scholes assumptions. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, if management changes its assumptions for future stock-based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock-based compensation expense and the Company's operational results could be materially impacted.\nCash Long-Term Incentive Plans\nThe Company maintains a long-term cash incentive program (\"Cash LTIP\") which entitles the holder to a cash payment equal to a target amount earned at the end of a performance period and is subject to (a) the grantee's continuing employment and (b) the Company's achievement of certain performance goals over a one, two or three-year performance period. Compensation expense for the Cash LTIP is recognized over the related performance periods based on the expected achievement of the performance goals, which involves judgment on the part of management.\nIncome Taxes\nFor a complete discussion of the Company's underlying assumptions and judgments for income taxes, see Notes 3 and 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nContingencies\nThe Company is, from time to time, involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business, including litigation instituted by persons injured upon premises under our control; litigation regarding the merchandise that we sell, including our advertising and marketing practices and product and safety concerns; litigation with respect to various employment matters, including wage and hour litigation; litigation with present or former employees; and litigation regarding intellectual property rights. Although such litigation is routine and incidental to the conduct of our business, as with any business of our size which has a significant number of employees and sells a significant amount of merchandise, such litigation could result in large monetary awards. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could materially exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our operational results, financial condition and cash flows. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of certain recently issued or proposed accounting standards which may impact our financial statements in future reporting periods.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ending on July 30, 2016.

This section discusses the potential impact to our reported operational results and financial condition of accounting standards that have been recently issued. \nOVERVIEW\nAcquisition of ANN INC.\nOn August 21, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of ANN INC. (the \"ANN Acquisition\"), a retailer of women's apparel, shoes and accessories sold primarily under the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. The purchase price consisted of approximately $1.75 billion in cash and the issuance of 31.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $345 million, based on the Company's stock price on the date of the acquisition, as more fully described in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with borrowings under a $1.8 billion seven-year, variable-rate term loan described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The acquisition is intended to diversify our portfolio of brands that serve the needs of women of different ages, sizes and demographics. ANN's operating results for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016 are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for Fiscal 2016.\nEnterprise-wide Transformation Project\nIn the second half of Fiscal 2016, the Company engaged a leading global professional services company to assess the Company's operations and identify and review strategic initiatives to support our long-term growth. In August 2016, we completed the initial benchmarking phase of our engagement and are in the process of selecting and planning workstreams to address opportunities\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nwith efficiency as well as enterprise capabilities. The operational assessment is expected to continue during the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. As a result, the Company is unable to estimate the financial impact of the project at this time.\nObjectives and Initiatives\nOur core strengths include a portfolio of value-oriented, lifestyle brands serving the female customer at various levels of maturity and sizes. This portfolio of brands is well-complemented by a strong and experienced management team and a disciplined investment philosophy. Despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow.\nOver the past few years, we have identified a number of ongoing key initiatives aimed at positioning the Company for enhanced growth and value creation by increasing our profitability through comparable sales growth, gross margin rate improvement and expense rate leverage resulting from synergies achieved through integration of newly acquired businesses. We remain committed to our long-term growth initiatives and ongoing expense management discipline. While dilutive to our earnings in the short-term, we continue to expect that the investments we have completed will create long-term shareholder value.\nThese objectives and initiatives include, but are not limited to, the following:\nDistribution and Fulfillment\nAs previously disclosed, our Justice, Lane Bryant, maurices, dressbarn and Catherines (\"legacy\") brands' distribution and fulfillment was centralized during Fiscal 2015 into our brick-and-mortar store distribution facility in Etna, Ohio and our ecommerce fulfillment facility in Greencastle, Indiana which has resulted in a reduction of our per-unit processing cost. Additionally, the Company completed the integration of ANN's ecommerce fulfillment into our Greencastle facility in August 2016 and is in the process of consolidating ANN's brick-and-mortar distribution from Louisville into our Etna facility. The Etna consolidation is expected to be completed during Fiscal 2017.\nDuring Fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a ten-year lease for a 583,000 square foot distribution center in Riverside, California to serve as the receiving and west coast distribution hub for the Company's merchandise coming from Asia. The Riverside facility is expected to begin operations during Fiscal 2017.\nWe believe that the integration of ANN's distribution operations into Etna and Greencastle and the opening of the Riverside distribution center will result in a further reduction of our per-unit processing cost.\nTransportation\nDuring Fiscal 2017, with the addition of ANN, we expect to continue to realize savings associated with our shipping contracts. These savings will be enabled as a result of the centralization of our brands' distribution and fulfillment activity.\nSourcing\nThe Company's brands source their products through a variety of sourcing channels. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.\nWe have internal sourcing operations under the name Ascena Global Sourcing (\"AGS\"). During Fiscal 2016, we continued our investment in personnel at AGS, and within the merchandising and design function at certain of our brands. Additionally, the Company currently sources some of its merchandise through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia.\nNon-merchandise Procurement\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we continued our efforts to leverage our volume of non-merchandise related goods and services purchases to negotiate favorable pricing. As part of these efforts, we are consolidating suppliers of our brands across multiple areas, including information technology support contracts, facilities, marketing arrangements, and general services and suppliers, among others.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOmni-channel Expansion\nWe continue to invest in our technology platforms to support the growth of our omni-channel strategy, with different brands at different stages of implementation. ANN launched the first phase of their omni-channel initiative in calendar 2012 and has added various enhancements and functionalities since then. Justice and maurices launched their new ecommerce platforms in Fiscal 2016 and we expect other brands to roll onto these platforms in Fiscal 2017. Our ecommerce platforms allow the brands to (i) enhance the customer shopping experience inside and outside our stores, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to collect and analyze customer transaction data to support strategic decisions.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur individual segments are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back-to-school shopping periods. In particular, sales at Justice tend to be significantly higher during the fall season, which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, as this includes the back-to-school period and the December holiday season. Our Lane Bryant, dressbarn, and Catherines segments tend to experience higher sales during the spring season, which include the Easter and Mother's Day holidays. Our ANN and maurices segments have relatively balanced sales across the Fall and Spring seasons. As a result, our operational results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels and patterns of consumer spending. Some of the factors that could negatively impact discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, reductions in net worth, higher energy and other prices, increasing interest rates and low consumer confidence. These factors above could have a negative effect on our operations, which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe U.S. economy continued to show mixed signs of recovery during Fiscal 2016. Within the retail sector, consumer sentiment in certain industries such as automotive and home improvements was generally positive, while the apparel industry appeared to be more challenging and inconsistent from month-to-month and company-to-company. Uncertainty around the U.S. Presidential election and the mixed economic environment could cause inconsistent sales trends to continue through the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. Our brands will continue to monitor the respective spending patterns of their consumers and adjust their operating strategies as necessary to mitigate these challenges and maximize operating performance.\nOmni-channel Strategy\nAs our omni-channel strategy continues to mature, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between store sales and ecommerce sales due to the following:\n \u2022 Stores increase ecommerce sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online; \n \u2022 Particular colors or sizes of merchandise not available in a store can be ordered online by our store associates and shipped from our ecommerce fulfillment center or another store directly to the customer; \n \u2022 Our websites increase store sales as in-store customers have often pre-shopped online before shopping in the store, including verification of which stores have merchandise in stock; \n \u2022 Ecommerce sales can be returned to our stores, creating mismatches between revenues and returns between the two channels; \n \u2022 Increased integration of brand specific merchandise planning, procurement and allocation functions serving stores and ecommerce channels together; and \n \u2022 The Company's marketing and loyalty programs become increasingly integrated to maintain customer relationship and improve traffic and conversion rate both in-store and online. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nWe believe our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales, and as a result, we only report combined comparable sales. Effective with the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, we ceased reporting store comparable sales and ecommerce sales separately.\nOperating Results\nOur Fiscal 2016 operating results reflected (i) ANN's operating income of $13.3 million for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016, including approximately $165 million of purchase accounting adjustments; (ii) improved operating results at Justice; (iii) Acquisition and integration expenses and (iv) a challenging retail environment with inconsistent consumer spending patterns.\nIn order to mitigate the negative impacts on our operating performance, where possible, we continue to adjust our brands' operating strategies including implementing the omni-channel strategy, refining inventory assortment, developing our hybrid sourcing model, leveraging our economies of scale and improving supply chain efficiencies.\nOperating highlights for Fiscal 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 Net sales for Fiscal 2016 increased $2.193 billion, or 45.6%, primarily due to the effect of the ANN Acquisition. For the legacy ascena brands, net sales were down 2.9%; \n \u2022 Comparable sales for the legacy ascena brands decreased by 5%, mainly caused by the anticipated decrease at Justice related principally to its new selling strategy. Comparable sales were down at all of our segments, with the exception of Lane Bryant which had a 1% increase in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 Gross margin rate increased by 60 basis points to 56.2% primarily due to higher margin rates at Justice. Gross Margin was negatively impacted in Fiscal 2016 by approximately $130 million of non-cash expenses for purchase accounting adjustments; \n \u2022 BD&O, SG&A and Depreciation and amortization expense were negatively impacted by $35 million of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, bringing the total non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, when combined with the $130 million discussed above, to $165 million; \n \u2022 $77.4 million of Acquisition and integration expenses for Fiscal 2016, compared to $31.7 million for Fiscal 2015; and \n \u2022 Net loss per diluted share of $0.06 in Fiscal 2016, compared to net loss per diluted share of $1.46 for Fiscal 2015. \nLiquidity highlights are as follows:\n \u2022 We were in a net debt position (total debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $1.275 billion as of the end of Fiscal 2016, compared to a net cash and investments position of $147.5 million as of the end of Fiscal 2015 primarily due to the term loan debt from the ANN Acquisition and our use of cash to support our capital expenditures; \n \u2022 Cash from operations was $445.4 million for Fiscal 2016, compared to $431.3 million for Fiscal 2015; \n \u2022 We used $1.495 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, for the ANN Acquisition and $366.5 million for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2016, compared to $312.5 million for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2015; \n \u2022 We used $18.6 million of available cash to purchase shares of our common stock for Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 We borrowed $1.8 billion during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 to fund the ANN Acquisition. We repurchased $72.0 million of the term loan for $68.4 million, made scheduled principal payments of $9.0 million and ended the year with an outstanding term loan principal balance of $1.719 billion; and \n \u2022 Net repayments under our revolving credit agreement totaled $116.0 million for Fiscal 2016, compared to net repayments of $56.0 million for Fiscal 2015. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nTransactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparability of the Company's operational results for the periods presented herein has been affected by certain transactions. A summary of the effect of these items on pretax income for each applicable period presented is noted below:\n\n(a) The remaining unamortized purchase accounting adjustments arising from the ANN Acquisition which will impact ANN's operating results in future periods are approximately $104 million with approximately $45 million to be recognized during Fiscal 2017.\n(b) Fiscal 2016 primarily represented costs related to the acquisition and integration of ANN. Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2014 primarily represented costs related to the integration of the Company's supply chain and information technology platforms.\n(c) Brothers was a separate boys apparel brand operating within the Justice segment and represented an immaterial portion of the Justice segment. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2015, the Company announced it was exiting the brand, which was completed by the end of Fiscal 2015.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nThe following table summarizes our operational results and expresses the percentage relationship to net sales of certain financial statement captions:\n\n_________\n(a) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the (provision) benefit for income taxes by the loss before the (provision) benefit for income taxes.\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2.193 billion, or 45.6%, to $6.995 billion in Fiscal 2016 from $4.803 billion in Fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the ANN Acquisition. For the legacy ascena brands, on a consolidated basis, for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015, comparable sales decreased by $214.0 million, or 5%, to $4.233 billion from $4.447 billion mainly as a result of anticipated sales declines at Justice principally related to its new, less promotional selling model. Non-comparable sales decreased by $0.2 million, or essentially flat, to $206.0 million from $206.2 million. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues decreased by $6.6 million, or 4%, to $143.4 million from $150.0 million. Net sales for the legacy ascena brands also included incremental revenues of approximately $82 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales and comparable store sales data for our six business segments is presented below.\n\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and ecommerce sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in only stores open in the current period and comparative period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Ecommerce sales generally refer to growth of sales from the Company's ecommerce channel. The Company believes our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales and we no longer feel that separate ecommerce and brick-and-mortar sales information is meaningful. Considering our customer cross channel behaviors, we believe that reporting one comparable sales metric is a more meaningful presentation.\n(b) Sales for the newly acquired ANN segment and incremental revenues of approximately $82 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016 are excluded from the calculation of comparable sales.\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nANN net sales of $2.331 billion represented ANN's net sales for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016.\nJustice net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 a decrease of $150.8 million, or 13%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016 mainly as a result of an anticipated decrease in customer transactions, which was caused by the less promotional selling model; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $24.9 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $28.8 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 41 net store closures during Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $15.8 million decrease in wholesale, licensing operations and other revenues. \nLane Bryant net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 an increase of $12.7 million, or 1%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $18.2 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $2.7 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, as the positive effect of 30 new store openings was more than offset by 23 store closings in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $6.2 million increase in other revenues. \nmaurices net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 a decrease of $16.2 million, or 2%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $18.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $36.0 million increase in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 42 net store openings during Fiscal 2016; and \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n \u2022 a $2.9 million increase in other revenues. \ndressbarn net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 a decrease of $45.5 million, or 5%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $16.5 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $0.9 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, as the positive effect of 15 new store openings was more than offset by 30 store closings in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $0.4 million decrease in other revenues. \nCatherines net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 an decrease of $14.2 million, or 4%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $4.8 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $3.8 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 4 net store closures during Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $0.5 million increase in other revenues. \nGross Margin, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased by 60 basis points to 56.2% in Fiscal 2016 from 55.6% in Fiscal 2015. Gross margin was negatively impacted in Fiscal 2016 by approximately $130 million of non-cash expenses for purchase accounting adjustments, primarily related to the amortization of the purchase accounting write-up of ANN's inventory to fair market value. The gross margin rate for the legacy ascena brands increased by 290 basis points from 55.6% to 58.5% primarily due to the less promotional selling model at Justice.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs.

This section discusses the potential impact to our reported operational results and financial condition of accounting standards that have been recently issued. \nOVERVIEW\nAcquisition of ANN INC.\nOn August 21, 2015, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of ANN INC. (the \"ANN Acquisition\"), a retailer of women's apparel, shoes and accessories sold primarily under the Ann Taylor and LOFT brands, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion. The purchase price consisted of approximately $1.75 billion in cash and the issuance of 31.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $345 million, based on the Company's stock price on the date of the acquisition, as more fully described in Note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The cash portion of the purchase price was funded with borrowings under a $1.8 billion seven-year, variable-rate term loan described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The acquisition is intended to diversify our portfolio of brands that serve the needs of women of different ages, sizes and demographics. ANN's operating results for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016 are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for Fiscal 2016.\nEnterprise-wide Transformation Project\nIn the second half of Fiscal 2016, the Company engaged a leading global professional services company to assess the Company's operations and identify and review strategic initiatives to support our long-term growth. In August 2016, we completed the initial benchmarking phase of our engagement and are in the process of selecting and planning workstreams to address opportunities\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nwith efficiency as well as enterprise capabilities. The operational assessment is expected to continue during the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. As a result, the Company is unable to estimate the financial impact of the project at this time.\nObjectives and Initiatives\nOur core strengths include a portfolio of value-oriented, lifestyle brands serving the female customer at various levels of maturity and sizes. This portfolio of brands is well-complemented by a strong and experienced management team and a disciplined investment philosophy. Despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long-term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow.\nOver the past few years, we have identified a number of ongoing key initiatives aimed at positioning the Company for enhanced growth and value creation by increasing our profitability through comparable sales growth, gross margin rate improvement and expense rate leverage resulting from synergies achieved through integration of newly acquired businesses. We remain committed to our long-term growth initiatives and ongoing expense management discipline. While dilutive to our earnings in the short-term, we continue to expect that the investments we have completed will create long-term shareholder value.\nThese objectives and initiatives include, but are not limited to, the following:\nDistribution and Fulfillment\nAs previously disclosed, our Justice, Lane Bryant, maurices, dressbarn and Catherines (\"legacy\") brands' distribution and fulfillment was centralized during Fiscal 2015 into our brick-and-mortar store distribution facility in Etna, Ohio and our ecommerce fulfillment facility in Greencastle, Indiana which has resulted in a reduction of our per-unit processing cost. Additionally, the Company completed the integration of ANN's ecommerce fulfillment into our Greencastle facility in August 2016 and is in the process of consolidating ANN's brick-and-mortar distribution from Louisville into our Etna facility. The Etna consolidation is expected to be completed during Fiscal 2017.\nDuring Fiscal 2016, the Company entered into a ten-year lease for a 583,000 square foot distribution center in Riverside, California to serve as the receiving and west coast distribution hub for the Company's merchandise coming from Asia. The Riverside facility is expected to begin operations during Fiscal 2017.\nWe believe that the integration of ANN's distribution operations into Etna and Greencastle and the opening of the Riverside distribution center will result in a further reduction of our per-unit processing cost.\nTransportation\nDuring Fiscal 2017, with the addition of ANN, we expect to continue to realize savings associated with our shipping contracts. These savings will be enabled as a result of the centralization of our brands' distribution and fulfillment activity.\nSourcing\nThe Company's brands source their products through a variety of sourcing channels. Factors affecting the selection of sourcing channels include cost, speed-to-market, merchandise selection, vendor capacity and fashion trends.\nWe have internal sourcing operations under the name Ascena Global Sourcing (\"AGS\"). During Fiscal 2016, we continued our investment in personnel at AGS, and within the merchandising and design function at certain of our brands. Additionally, the Company currently sources some of its merchandise through third-party buying agents based mainly in Asia.\nNon-merchandise Procurement\nDuring Fiscal 2016, we continued our efforts to leverage our volume of non-merchandise related goods and services purchases to negotiate favorable pricing. As part of these efforts, we are consolidating suppliers of our brands across multiple areas, including information technology support contracts, facilities, marketing arrangements, and general services and suppliers, among others.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nOmni-channel Expansion\nWe continue to invest in our technology platforms to support the growth of our omni-channel strategy, with different brands at different stages of implementation. ANN launched the first phase of their omni-channel initiative in calendar 2012 and has added various enhancements and functionalities since then. Justice and maurices launched their new ecommerce platforms in Fiscal 2016 and we expect other brands to roll onto these platforms in Fiscal 2017. Our ecommerce platforms allow the brands to (i) enhance the customer shopping experience inside and outside our stores, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency and (iv) enhance our capability to collect and analyze customer transaction data to support strategic decisions.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur individual segments are typically affected by seasonal sales trends primarily resulting from the timing of holiday and back-to-school shopping periods. In particular, sales at Justice tend to be significantly higher during the fall season, which occurs during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, as this includes the back-to-school period and the December holiday season. Our Lane Bryant, dressbarn, and Catherines segments tend to experience higher sales during the spring season, which include the Easter and Mother's Day holidays. Our ANN and maurices segments have relatively balanced sales across the Fall and Spring seasons. As a result, our operational results and cash flows may fluctuate materially in any quarterly period depending on, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable store sales, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and changes in merchandise mix.\nSummary of Financial Performance\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nOur performance is subject to macroeconomic conditions and their impact on levels and patterns of consumer spending. Some of the factors that could negatively impact discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, high unemployment, lower wage levels, reductions in net worth, higher energy and other prices, increasing interest rates and low consumer confidence. These factors above could have a negative effect on our operations, which in turn could have a material effect on our business, operational results, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe U.S. economy continued to show mixed signs of recovery during Fiscal 2016. Within the retail sector, consumer sentiment in certain industries such as automotive and home improvements was generally positive, while the apparel industry appeared to be more challenging and inconsistent from month-to-month and company-to-company. Uncertainty around the U.S. Presidential election and the mixed economic environment could cause inconsistent sales trends to continue through the first quarter of Fiscal 2017. Our brands will continue to monitor the respective spending patterns of their consumers and adjust their operating strategies as necessary to mitigate these challenges and maximize operating performance.\nOmni-channel Strategy\nAs our omni-channel strategy continues to mature, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between store sales and ecommerce sales due to the following:\n \u2022 Stores increase ecommerce sales by providing customers opportunities to view, touch and/or try on physical merchandise before ordering online; \n \u2022 Particular colors or sizes of merchandise not available in a store can be ordered online by our store associates and shipped from our ecommerce fulfillment center or another store directly to the customer; \n \u2022 Our websites increase store sales as in-store customers have often pre-shopped online before shopping in the store, including verification of which stores have merchandise in stock; \n \u2022 Ecommerce sales can be returned to our stores, creating mismatches between revenues and returns between the two channels; \n \u2022 Increased integration of brand specific merchandise planning, procurement and allocation functions serving stores and ecommerce channels together; and \n \u2022 The Company's marketing and loyalty programs become increasingly integrated to maintain customer relationship and improve traffic and conversion rate both in-store and online. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nWe believe our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales, and as a result, we only report combined comparable sales. Effective with the first quarter of Fiscal 2016, we ceased reporting store comparable sales and ecommerce sales separately.\nOperating Results\nOur Fiscal 2016 operating results reflected (i) ANN's operating income of $13.3 million for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016, including approximately $165 million of purchase accounting adjustments; (ii) improved operating results at Justice; (iii) Acquisition and integration expenses and (iv) a challenging retail environment with inconsistent consumer spending patterns.\nIn order to mitigate the negative impacts on our operating performance, where possible, we continue to adjust our brands' operating strategies including implementing the omni-channel strategy, refining inventory assortment, developing our hybrid sourcing model, leveraging our economies of scale and improving supply chain efficiencies.\nOperating highlights for Fiscal 2016 are as follows:\n \u2022 Net sales for Fiscal 2016 increased $2.193 billion, or 45.6%, primarily due to the effect of the ANN Acquisition. For the legacy ascena brands, net sales were down 2.9%; \n \u2022 Comparable sales for the legacy ascena brands decreased by 5%, mainly caused by the anticipated decrease at Justice related principally to its new selling strategy. Comparable sales were down at all of our segments, with the exception of Lane Bryant which had a 1% increase in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 Gross margin rate increased by 60 basis points to 56.2% primarily due to higher margin rates at Justice. Gross Margin was negatively impacted in Fiscal 2016 by approximately $130 million of non-cash expenses for purchase accounting adjustments; \n \u2022 BD&O, SG&A and Depreciation and amortization expense were negatively impacted by $35 million of non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, bringing the total non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, when combined with the $130 million discussed above, to $165 million; \n \u2022 $77.4 million of Acquisition and integration expenses for Fiscal 2016, compared to $31.7 million for Fiscal 2015; and \n \u2022 Net loss per diluted share of $0.06 in Fiscal 2016, compared to net loss per diluted share of $1.46 for Fiscal 2015. \nLiquidity highlights are as follows:\n \u2022 We were in a net debt position (total debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) of $1.275 billion as of the end of Fiscal 2016, compared to a net cash and investments position of $147.5 million as of the end of Fiscal 2015 primarily due to the term loan debt from the ANN Acquisition and our use of cash to support our capital expenditures; \n \u2022 Cash from operations was $445.4 million for Fiscal 2016, compared to $431.3 million for Fiscal 2015; \n \u2022 We used $1.495 billion of cash, net of cash acquired, for the ANN Acquisition and $366.5 million for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2016, compared to $312.5 million for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2015; \n \u2022 We used $18.6 million of available cash to purchase shares of our common stock for Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 We borrowed $1.8 billion during the first quarter of Fiscal 2016 to fund the ANN Acquisition. We repurchased $72.0 million of the term loan for $68.4 million, made scheduled principal payments of $9.0 million and ended the year with an outstanding term loan principal balance of $1.719 billion; and \n \u2022 Net repayments under our revolving credit agreement totaled $116.0 million for Fiscal 2016, compared to net repayments of $56.0 million for Fiscal 2015. \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nTransactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nThe comparability of the Company's operational results for the periods presented herein has been affected by certain transactions.

Not meaningful.\nNet Sales. Net sales increased by $2.193 billion, or 45.6%, to $6.995 billion in Fiscal 2016 from $4.803 billion in Fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to the effect of the ANN Acquisition. For the legacy ascena brands, on a consolidated basis, for Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015, comparable sales decreased by $214.0 million, or 5%, to $4.233 billion from $4.447 billion mainly as a result of anticipated sales declines at Justice principally related to its new, less promotional selling model. Non-comparable sales decreased by $0.2 million, or essentially flat, to $206.0 million from $206.2 million. Wholesale, licensing and other revenues decreased by $6.6 million, or 4%, to $143.4 million from $150.0 million. Net sales for the legacy ascena brands also included incremental revenues of approximately $82 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016.\nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\nNet sales and comparable store sales data for our six business segments is presented below.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 25,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ANN\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,330.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,330.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Justice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,106.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,276.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Lane Bryant\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,130.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,095.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> maurices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,101.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,060.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> dressbarn\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>993.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,023.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Catherines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>346.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,995.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,802.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,192.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable sales (a)(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______\n(a) Comparable sales represent combined store comparable sales and ecommerce sales. Store comparable sales generally refers to the growth of sales in only stores open in the current period and comparative period in the prior year (including stores relocated within the same shopping center and stores with minor square footage additions). Stores that close during the fiscal year are excluded from store comparable sales beginning with the fiscal month the store actually closes. Ecommerce sales generally refer to growth of sales from the Company's ecommerce channel. The Company believes our ecommerce operations are interdependent with our brick-and-mortar store sales and we no longer feel that separate ecommerce and brick-and-mortar sales information is meaningful. Considering our customer cross channel behaviors, we believe that reporting one comparable sales metric is a more meaningful presentation.\n(b) Sales for the newly acquired ANN segment and incremental revenues of approximately $82 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016 are excluded from the calculation of comparable sales.\n(NM) Not meaningful.\nANN net sales of $2.331 billion represented ANN's net sales for the post-acquisition period from August 22, 2015 to July 30, 2016.\nJustice net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 a decrease of $150.8 million, or 13%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016 mainly as a result of an anticipated decrease in customer transactions, which was caused by the less promotional selling model; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $24.9 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $28.8 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 41 net store closures during Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $15.8 million decrease in wholesale, licensing operations and other revenues. \nLane Bryant net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 an increase of $12.7 million, or 1%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $18.2 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $2.7 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, as the positive effect of 30 new store openings was more than offset by 23 store closings in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $6.2 million increase in other revenues. \nmaurices net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 a decrease of $16.2 million, or 2%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $18.0 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $36.0 million increase in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 42 net store openings during Fiscal 2016; and \nASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC.\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (Continued)\n \u2022 a $2.9 million increase in other revenues. \ndressbarn net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 a decrease of $45.5 million, or 5%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $16.5 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $0.9 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, as the positive effect of 15 new store openings was more than offset by 30 store closings in Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $0.4 million decrease in other revenues. \nCatherines net sales performance primarily reflects:\n \u2022 an decrease of $14.2 million, or 4%, in comparable sales during Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 incremental revenues of $4.8 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2016; \n \u2022 a $3.8 million decrease in non-comparable stores sales, caused by 4 net store closures during Fiscal 2016; and \n \u2022 a $0.5 million increase in other revenues. \nGross Margin, which represents the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales, increased by 60 basis points to 56.2% in Fiscal 2016 from 55.6% in Fiscal 2015. Gross margin was negatively impacted in Fiscal 2016 by approximately $130 million of non-cash expenses for purchase accounting adjustments, primarily related to the amortization of the purchase accounting write-up of ANN's inventory to fair market value. The gross margin rate for the legacy ascena brands increased by 290 basis points from 55.6% to 58.5% primarily due to the less promotional selling model at Justice.\nGross margin as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among brands, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year.\nBuying, Distribution and Occupancy (\"BD&O\") Expenses consist of store occupancy and utility costs (excluding depreciation) and all costs associated with the buying and distribution functions.\nBD&O expenses increased by $429.6 million, or 50.1%, to $1,286.5 million in Fiscal 2016 from $856.9 million in Fiscal 2015.
