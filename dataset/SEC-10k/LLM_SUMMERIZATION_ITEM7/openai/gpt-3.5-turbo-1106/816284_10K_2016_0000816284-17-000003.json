MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nCelgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d Celgene\u201d or the Company\u201d), is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Celgene Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986.\nOur primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae) and THALOMID\u00ae (sold as THALOMID\u00ae or Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae outside of the U.S.). In addition, we earn revenue from other product sales and licensing arrangements.\nWe continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. Our clinical trial activity includes trials across the disease areas of hematology, solid tumors, and inflammation and immunology. REVLIMID\u00ae is in several phase III trials covering a range of hematological malignancies that include multiple myeloma, lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In solid tumors, ABRAXANE\u00ae is currently in various stages of investigation for breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. In inflammation and immunology, OTEZLA\u00ae is being evaluated in phase III trials for Beh\u00e7et's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. We also have a growing number of potential products in phase III trials across multiple diseases. In the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area, we have phase III trials underway for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and for GED-0301 (mongersen) in Crohn's disease. In hematology, phase III trials are underway for CC-486 and luspatercept in MDS, for CC-486 and enasidenib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for luspatercept in beta-thalassemia. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted a new drug application (NDA) for enasidenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.\nBeyond our phase III programs, we have access to a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel potential therapies to address significant unmet medical needs that consists of new drug candidates and cell therapies developed in-house, licensed from other companies or able to be optioned from collaboration partners. We believe that continued use of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, potential regulatory approvals of new products and new indications for existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.\nThe following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\nversus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\nversus\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,229.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,256.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,670.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,999.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,999.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased by $1.973 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae. The $397.2 million increase in net income and $0.55 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2016 as compared to 2015 were primarily due to a higher level of net product sales and a $601.9 million reduction in collaboration-related expenses, partly offset by increases in other expenses, including $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab AG (EngMab), Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Acetylon), and Triphase Research and Development I Corporation (Triphase), $345.3 million of increased impairment charges related to strategic equity investments, which included $272.2 million related to our equity investment in Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno), an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $198.5 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense, and an $83.1 million impairment charge related to the technology platform obtained in our 2012 acquisition of Avila Therapeutics, Inc.

The increase in total revenue of $1.586 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 reflected increases of $1.121 billion, or 25.0%, in the United States, and $464.4 million, or 14.6%, in international markets.\nNet Product Sales: Total net product sales for 2016 increased by $2.024 billion, or 22.1%, to $11.185 billion compared to 2015. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.680 billion and net price increases of $415.2 million, offset in part by a $71.2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID\u00ae and ABRAXANE\u00ae. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.\nTotal net product sales for 2015 increased by $1.597 billion, or 21.1%, to $9.161 billion compared to 2014. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.467 billion and net price increases of $239.8 million, offset in part by a $109.4 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, and ABRAXANE\u00ae, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID\u00ae. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.\nREVLIMID\u00ae net sales increased by $1.173 billion, or 20.2%, to $6.974 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets and price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID\u00ae in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains. REVLIMID\u00ae launched in the U.S. and EU for the Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma following approval in February 2015.\nNet sales of REVLIMID\u00ae increased by $821.1 million, or 16.5%, to $5.801 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets in addition to price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID\u00ae in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains.\nPOMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae net sales increased by $327.4 million, or 33.3%, to $1.311 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $777.5 million in the United States and $533.2 million in international markets. Increases in treatment duration\ncontributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae. Achieving reimbursement in additional countries, notably in Japan, also continues to contribute to the growth of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae net sales in international markets.\nNet sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae increased by $303.6 million, or 44.7%, to $983.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $591.8 million in the United States and $391.5 million in international markets. Increases in market share and treatment duration contributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae.\nOTEZLA\u00ae net sales increased by $545.5 million to $1.017 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $904.4 million in the United States and $112.8 million in international markets. 2016 was the second full year on the market in the U.S. Growth in the U.S. reflects increased market share and expanding accessibility to patients. Sales in international markets continued to expand during 2016, with growing sales in early launch countries in Europe and additional international approvals.\nNet sales of OTEZLA\u00ae increased by $401.9 million to $471.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $440.0 million in the United States and $31.7 million in international markets. OTEZLA\u00ae net sales were $69.8 million for 2014, primarily from sales in the United States. OTEZLA\u00ae was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. OTEZLA\u00ae was approved for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the EU in January 2015. Launch activities for OTEZLA\u00ae commenced in March 2014 and we began recognizing revenue related to OTEZLA\u00ae during the second quarter of 2014.\nABRAXANE\u00ae net sales increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6% to $973.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. U.S. sales of $633.8 million and international sales of $339.6 million decreased 3.0 percent and increased 8.2 percent, respectively. The increase in international sales was primarily due to increased unit sales, which were partially offset by price decreases. The decrease in U.S. sales was due to volume decreases partly offset by price increases. The decrease in U.S. sales reflects the increased competition in breast cancer and lung cancer indications from new market entrants.\nNet sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae increased by $119.3 million, or 14.1%, to $967.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit volumes in both the U.S. and international markets reflecting increased acceptance of the product for the treatment of both metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ABRAXANE\u00ae was approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as first-line treatment in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy in the European Union in March 2015.\nVIDAZA\u00ae net sales increased by $17.3 million, or 2.9%, to $608.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $26.6 million increase in international markets resulting from increased unit sales which were partly offset by price decreases in international markets and both volume and price decreases in the U.S. market.\nNet sales of VIDAZA\u00ae decreased by $21.2 million, or 3.5%, to $590.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $21.6 million decrease in U.S. sales resulting from the September 2013 introduction of a generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae by a competitor, which was partly offset by volume increases in international markets.\nAzacitidine for injection net sales decreased by $17.9 million, or 21.3%, to $66.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to price decreases partially offset by an increase in unit volumes. Azacitidine for injection is a generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae supplied by us to Sandoz AG (Sandoz).\nAzacitidine for injection net sales increased by $5.7 million, or 7.3%, to $83.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales to Sandoz, which were partly offset by price decreases.\nTHALOMID\u00ae net sales decreased by $33.3 million, or 18.0%, to $152.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes in the U.S.\nNet sales of THALOMID\u00ae decreased by $35.8 million, or 16.2%, to $185.4 million for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes and price decreases in both U.S. and international markets.\nISTODAX\u00ae net sales increased by $10.2 million, or 14.8%, to $79.3 million for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in unit volume as well as price increases.\nNet sales of ISTODAX\u00ae increased by $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $69.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in unit sales.\nThe \"other\" net product sales category, which includes sales of FOCALIN\u00ae, decreased by $4.1 million, to $4.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The \"other\" net product sales category decreased by $0.8 million to $8.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Revenue: Other revenue decreased by $50.3 million to $44.6 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $36.0 million decrease in royalty revenue from Novartis AG (Novartis) based upon its sales of both RITALIN\u00ae and FOCALIN XR\u00ae, both of which have been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets and we expect that trend to continue in 2017. Generic competition entered the market in the United States for certain strengths of FOCALIN XR in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nOther revenue decreased by $11.7 million to $94.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $14.1 million decrease in royalty revenue. The decrease in royalty revenue was driven by lower royalties earned from Novartis based on its sales of FOCALIN XR\u00ae and RITALIN\u00ae, which have both been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets.\nGross to Net Sales Accruals: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, chargebacks and distributor service fees.\nREVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), POMALYST REMS\u00ae and THALOMID REMS\u00ae programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae. Internationally, REVLIMID\u00ae, THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae and IMNOVID\u00ae are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the product's safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, ISTODAX\u00ae and VIDAZA\u00ae are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae.\nWe base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.\nSales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.\nGovernment rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-sponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.\nRebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.\nChargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.\nGross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

for 2016 and 2015 follows:\n2016 compared to 2015: Provisions for sales returns decreased by $5.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the ABRAXANE\u00ae allowances for sales returns being $5.0 million higher in 2015 than in 2016 due to an increase in inventory levels held by certain distributors in 2015. Provisions for sales returns also decreased by $1.0 million each for both REVLIMID\u00ae and ISTODAX\u00ae. These reductions were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in the returns allowance for OTEZLA\u00ae in 2016 primarily related to returns of product that had reached their expiration dates.\nDiscount provisions increased by $41.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $41.8 million increase consisted of a $37.7 million increase in the United States and a $4.1 million increase related to international markets. The U.S. increases included increases of $21.0 million for cash discounts related to REVLIMID\u00ae, $12.8 million related to OTEZLA\u00ae and $4.3 million related to POMALYST\u00ae.\nGovernment rebate provisions increased by $269.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $120.8 million increase in international government rebates. The increase in international government rebates was primarily driven by higher sales volumes for our primary products in Europe and increased international rebate rates, as well as an adjustment of our accrual to reflect higher rebate rates for IMNOVID\u00ae in France. The increase in the allowance for sales of IMNOVID\u00ae in France related to prior periods was $15.1 million and the increase for sales of IMNOVID\u00ae in the current year due to higher rebate rates in France was $23.2 million. The $148.5 million increase in the U.S. market was primarily due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, with $107.7 million due to an increase in Medicaid rebates (primarily in the managed care channel) and $40.8 million due to an increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.\nChargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $211.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Chargebacks increased by approximately $140.4 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $71.4 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes, including an $11.4 million increase related to the TRICARE program driven by higher sales volume and increased rebate rates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA\u00ae, which accounted for $64.1 million of the increase in distributor service fees.\n2015 compared to 2014: Provisions for sales returns increased by $13.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in ABRAXANE\u00ae returns reserve allowance related to inventory levels held by certain distributors at the end of 2015. Higher net product sales volumes and elevated returns activity in the U.S. market also resulted in $6.0 million of increases in 2015. In addition, $4.8 million of reductions in returns reserves were recorded in 2014 for the migration of THALOMID\u00ae to specialty pharmacies and for VIDAZA\u00ae inventory levels held at distributors following competition from generic versions of VIDAZA\u00ae. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to POMALYST\u00ae in 2015 due to lower returns activity.\nDiscount provisions increased by $23.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $23.8 million increase consisted of a $24.3 million increase in the United States, which included increases of $13.4 million of cash discounts related to REVLIMID\u00ae, $8.9 million related to OTEZLA\u00ae and $3.0 million related to POMALYST\u00ae. The U.S. increases were partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease related to international cash discounts.\nGovernment rebate provisions increased by $132.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $97.9 million increase in international government rebates, due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, and a $26.4 million increase related to Medicaid rebates due to increased sales and Medicaid expansion and a $8.1 million increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.\nChargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $164.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Chargebacks increased by approximately $102.1 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $62.0 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes and a greater portion of sales qualifying for chargeback rebates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA\u00ae, which launched in April 2014, resulting in an increase of $49.3 million in service fees for 2015.\nCost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets): Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of net product sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $17.9 million to $438.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 3.9% for 2016 compared to 4.6% for 2015, primarily due to OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae and azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.\nCost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $34.2 million to $420.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. The changing mix of product sales toward lower cost products that was seen in 2016 compared to 2015 also occurred in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 4.6% for 2015 compared to 5.1% for 2014, primarily due to OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae and azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.\nResearch and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and milestone payments resulting from collaboration arrangements and expenses for research and development asset acquisitions.\nResearch and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,470.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,697.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,430.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>772.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,266.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased by $772.8 million to $4.470 billion in 2016, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab, Acetylon, and Triphase as well as increases in activity in support of our early- to mid-stage product pipeline, partially offset by decreases in expenses related to collaboration arrangements. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to our purchases of EngMab, Acetylon, and Triphase.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $1.267 billion to $3.697 billion in 2015 compared to 2014.

The increase was primarily due to increases in expenses associated with our growing organization to support inflammation and immunology products and product candidates, such as OTEZLA\u00ae as well as increases in selling and marketing activities related to recently approved indications for REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets: Amortization of intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Avila\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>139.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Abraxis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gloucester\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pharmion\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quanticel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>459.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>180.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets increased by $180.0 million to $459.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in amortization expense primarily related to an $83.1 million impairment charge as well as $18.4 million of accelerated amortization expense, both related to the technology platform obtained in the Avila acquisition, amortization of the technology platform acquired in the October 2015 acquisition of Quanticel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Quanticel), and a reduction in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets obtained in the acquisition of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Gloucester) following the grant to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC of a non-exclusive, royalty-free sublicense to manufacture and market a generic version of romidepsin for injection as of February 1, 2018.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets increased by $20.7 million to $279.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to the amortization of the technology platform asset recorded in the acquisition of Quanticel and an acceleration of amortization expense related to certain Gloucester related intangible assets, partly offset by certain Abraxis related intangibles becoming fully amortized during the first half of 2014.\nAcquisition Related Charges and Restructuring, net: Acquisition related charges and restructuring, net is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>289.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>299.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(261.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>250.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(122.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisition related charges and restructuring, net decreased by $261.8 million to $37.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in the net expense for the current year period compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a $296.7 million reduction in costs related to the acquisition of Receptos which occurred in August 2015 and a $61.3 million increase in the benefit recorded for adjustments to contingent consideration issued as part of the acquisition of Avila related to adjustments made to estimates of probability and timing of future potential milestone payments payable to the former shareholders of Avila. These benefits were partly offset by a $77.1 million reduction in benefit recorded for fair value adjustments to our liability related to publicly traded contingent value rights (CVRs) that were issued as part of the acquisition of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (Abraxis), an $8.1 million increase in expense related to our contingent liabilities for the Quanticel acquisition, and a $6.5 million increase in restructuring charges in the current year period related to our relocation of certain operations into our two Summit, NJ locations as well as costs associated with certain headcount reductions.\nAcquisition related charges and restructuring, net increased by $250.9 million to $299.6 million in 2015 compared to $48.7 million in 2014. The increase was due to $296.8 million in costs related to the acquisition of Receptos in August 2015, a $28.3 million increase in expense in the current year period related to our contingent liabilities for the Nogra Pharma Limited (Nogra) acquisition, which was acquired in the second quarter of 2014, a $18.7 million reduction in the benefit recorded in the current year period for our contingent liabilities related to the Avila acquisition compared to the prior year period, and $9.9 million of restructuring charges related to our relocation of certain operations into our two Summit, NJ locations as well as costs associated with certain headcount reductions. These increases in expense were partly offset by a $102.6 million reduction in expense in the current year period related to reductions in the fair value of our liability related to publicly traded CVRs that were issued as part of the acquisition of Abraxis in 2010.\nInterest and Investment Income, Net: Interest and investment income, net is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and investment income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage increase (decrease) from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest and investment income, net which includes the net income associated with our investments in available-for-sale marketable securities, decreased by $0.8 million to $30.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015.\nInterest and investment income, net increased by $2.9 million to $31.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to lower losses on the sale of marketable securities in 2015 compared to the prior year.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense is summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>189.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>134.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased by $189.5 million to $500.1 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to interest expense associated with the issuance of $8.000 billion of senior notes in August 2015.

The effective tax rate for 2016 is 15.7%. Our effective tax rate is a function of the distribution of our pre-tax income among the many jurisdictions in which we operate. Our pre-tax income is earned and taxed in either the U.S. at a statutory tax rate of 35%, or outside the U.S. at significantly lower statutory tax rates. The differences in tax rates between jurisdictions can significantly impact our effective tax rate as our business changes and pre-tax earnings shift from year to year. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.8%. The 5.1 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily the result of tax benefits related to a loss on our investment in Avila, offset by a non-deductible pre-tax charge related to our acquisition of Acetylon and non-recurring charges to tax expense recorded in 2015 related to both the global mix of funding sources for payments to collaboration partners, primarily the initiation of our collaborations with AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) and Juno, and an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets obtained in our acquisition of Receptos, Inc. (Receptos).\nThe income tax provision increased by $94.0 million to $421.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in the effective tax rate, partially offset by a decrease in income before taxes. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 20.8%. The effective tax rate for 2014 was 14.1%. The 6.7 percentage point increase in our effective tax rate in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily the result of an increase in tax expense related to the global mix of funding sources for payments to collaboration partners, primarily the initiation of our collaborations with AstraZeneca and Juno, and an increase in the valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets obtained in our acquisition of Receptos, partially offset by a non-recurring tax expense recorded in 2014 related to the launch of new products.\nAccounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation\" (ASU 2016-09) changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions including requiring all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized in the income tax provision. The new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2017. We anticipate that the new standard will have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate in 2017. The amount of the reduction to our effective tax rate will depend upon future movements in our share price as well as the magnitude of stock award exercises, which are both difficult to estimate. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to this accounting standard update.\nIn addition to our future adoption of ASU 2016-09, our future effective tax rate can be materially impacted by shifts in the distribution of our pre-tax income among the jurisdictions where we operate, as well as payments to collaboration partners, acquisitions, divestitures, changes in tax laws, audit settlements, and many other factors which are difficult to forecast.\nNet Income: Net income and per common share amounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,999.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,999.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Per common share amounts:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>777.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>792.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>802.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>803.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>824.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>836.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $397.2 million increase in net income to $1.999 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a higher level of net product sales and a $601.9 million reduction in collaboration-related expenses, partly offset by increases in other expenses, including $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab, Acetylon and Triphase, $345.3 million of increased impairment charges related to strategic equity investments, which included $272.2 million related to our equity investment in Juno, an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $198.5 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense, and an $83.1 million impairment charge related to the technology platform obtained in our 2012 acquisition of Avila.\nThe $397.9 million decrease in net income to $1.602 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher research and development collaboration related expenses, which included upfront expenses of $575.1 million, $450.0 million, and $149.8 million for our collaborations with Juno, AstraZeneca and Nurix, respectively, as well as $400.4 million of expenses associated with the acquisition and operations of Receptos. The increased collaboration and acquisition related expenses in 2015 were partly offset by higher net product sales as well as an $85.9 million realized gain on the sale of our equity investment in Flexus Biosciences, Inc. in April 2015. The $0.45 decrease in diluted earnings per share in 2015 compared to 2014 was favorably impacted by the repurchase of 28.1 million common shares under our common share repurchase program, reducing our outstanding share base.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the components of our financial condition for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\nversus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\nversus\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,169.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,880.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,121.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,289.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>758.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,799.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,671.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,425.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,753.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total financial assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,969.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,551.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,546.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,417.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(994.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>605.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(605.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, net of discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,788.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,161.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,216.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(372.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,944.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,289.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,161.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,822.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,338.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Working capital1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,963.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,492.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,617.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(124.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>Includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available-for-sale, accounts receivable, net of allowances, inventory and other current assets, less short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and income taxes payable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe rely primarily on positive cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from sales of available-for-sale marketable securities and borrowings in the form of long-term notes payable and short-term commercial paper to provide for our liquidity requirements.

However, we anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalent balances, marketable securities available-for-sale, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to fund our operating needs, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and our plans to purchase our stock and pursue strategic business initiatives for the foreseeable future.\nMany of our operations are conducted outside the United States and significant portions of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are held internationally. As of December 31, 2016, we held approximately $6.113 billion of these short-term funds in foreign tax jurisdictions. The amount of funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business, including intercompany transactions, as well as for other reasons, such as repurchases of our common stock, internal reorganizations, business-development activities and debt issuances. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). Repatriation of overseas funds can result in additional U.S. federal, state and local income tax payments. We record U.S. deferred tax liabilities for certain unremitted earnings, but when amounts earned overseas are expected to be permanently reinvested outside of the United States, no accrual for U.S. taxes is provided. Approximately $900.0 million of our foreign earnings, included in the $6.113 billion of short-term funds in foreign tax jurisdictions, may not be required for use in offshore operations and may be available for use in the United States. These earnings are not treated as permanently reinvested and accordingly, our deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included $316.5 million for the estimated U.S. federal and state income taxes that may be incurred should these earnings be repatriated. The remaining foreign earnings are unremitted and expected to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. We do not rely on these earnings as a source of funds for our domestic business as we expect to have sufficient current cash resources combined with future cash flows in the United States to fund our U.S. operational and strategic needs.\nShare Repurchase Program: In June 2016, our Board of Directors approved an increase of $3.000 billion to our authorized share repurchase program, bringing the total amount authorized since April 2009 to an aggregate of up to $20.500 billion of our common stock of which we have approximately $4.731 billion remaining for future share repurchases. During 2016, we used $2.160 billion for repurchases of our common stock, measured on a settlement date basis.\nComponents of Working Capital\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities Available for Sale: We invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds, repurchase agreements, time deposits, U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government-sponsored agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), global corporate debt securities and asset backed securities. All liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents and all investments with maturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities available-for-sale. The $1.418 billion increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale at December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to $3.976 billion of net cash from operating activities, partially offset by $2.160 billion of payments under our share repurchase program and $562.5 million of net unrealized holding losses on marketable securities available-for-sale.\nMarketable securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, held for an unspecified period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, which are deemed to be temporary, are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of tax. The cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. The amortization, along with realized gains and losses and other than temporary impairment charges, is included in interest and investment income, net. For more information related to the fair value and valuation of our marketable securities, see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAccounts Receivable, Net: Accounts receivable, net increased by $199.7 million to $1.621 billion at December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Sales made outside the United States typically have payment terms that are greater than 60 days, thereby extending collection periods beyond those in the United States. We expect our accounts receivable balance to grow as our international sales continue to expand.\nWe continue to monitor economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international economies, the sovereign debt situation in certain European countries and associated impacts on the financial markets and our business. Our current business model in these markets is typically to sell our products directly to principally government owned or controlled hospitals, which in turn directly deliver critical care to patients. Our products are used to treat life-threatening diseases and we believe this business model enables timely delivery and adequate supply of products. Many of the outstanding receivable balances are related to government-funded hospitals and we believe the receivable balances are ultimately collectible. Similarly, we believe that future sales to these customers will continue to be collectible.\nInventory: Inventory balances increased by $54.5 million to $497.9 million at the end of 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in ABRAXANE\u00ae raw materials.\nOther Current Assets: Other current assets decreased by $205.4 million to $779.3 million at the end of 2016 compared to 2015 due to a $47.7 million decrease in the fair value of derivative instruments recorded as Other current assets, a $115.5 million decrease in prepaid taxes and a $42.2 million net decrease in other accounts.\nCommercial Paper: We have a commercial paper program (Program) under which we issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper) on a private placement basis, the proceeds of which are used for general corporate purposes. In April 2016 our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the maximum amount of commercial paper issuable to $2.000 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had available capacity to issue up to $2.000 billion of Commercial Paper and there were no borrowings under the Program. The maturities of the Commercial Paper may vary, but may not exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The Commercial Paper is sold under customary terms to a dealer or in the commercial paper market and is issued at a discount from par or, alternatively, is sold at par and bears varying interest rates on a fixed or floating basis. Borrowings under the Program, if any, are accounted for as short-term borrowings.\nSenior Unsecured Credit Facility: We maintain a senior unsecured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility) that provides revolving credit in the aggregate amount of $2.000 billion which was increased from $1.750 billion in April 2016 and extended from April 17, 2020 to April 17, 2021. Amounts may be borrowed in U.S. Dollars for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility currently serves as backup liquidity for our Commercial Paper borrowings. At December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding borrowing against the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including certain customary financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nAccounts Payable, Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities: Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by $473.6 million to $2.362 billion at the end of 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases of $194.5 million for sales adjustment accruals, $198.5 million for a litigation-related loss contingency accrual, $86.7 million for clinical trial and research and development expense accruals and $60.4 million for compensation-related accruals and $99.5 million of net other increases. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $103.5 million related to collaboration agreement accruals and $62.5 million of contingent consideration related accruals.\nIncome Taxes Payable (Current and Non-Current): Income taxes payable increased by $117.6 million to $461.6 million at the end of 2016 compared to 2015, primarily from the current provision for income taxes of $717.3 million and net deferred intercompany credits of $21.9 million, offset by income tax payments of $373.0 million, tax benefits of share-based compensation of $186.2 million and a decrease in refundable income taxes of $65.6 million.\nSenior Notes: We have an aggregate of $14.250 billion principal amount of senior notes outstanding with varying maturity dates from 2017 through 2045, with $500.0 million maturing in August 2017.\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\nversus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\nversus\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,976.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,483.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,806.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,492.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(322.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,002.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,259.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,438.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,256.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,821.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,645.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,584.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(417.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6,230.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,001.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.492 billion to $3.976 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of $397.2 million in 2016 compared to 2015, which included a $493.5 million net increase in adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities for items such as impairment charges, derivative activities, changes in deferred income taxes and amortization expenses compared to 2015. Derivative activities during 2016 included cash receipts of $195.6 million related to the settlement of interest rate swap contracts that had been designated as fair value hedges of certain of our fixed rate notes. Increases in net cash provided by operating activities were also driven by a $420.4 million increase in change in other operating assets primarily attributable to a $297.6 million decrease in prepaid taxes and a $91.9 million increase in change in accounts payable and other operating liabilities primarily attributable to an increase of $198.5 million of accrued expenses related to a litigation-related loss contingency accrual as well as other balance sheet fluctuations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased by $322.4 million to $2.484 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily attributable to a decrease in net income of $397.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014 driven by increased research and development collaboration related expenses.\nInvesting Activities: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $5.257 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the purchases of Receptos and Quanticel in 2015 without a corresponding purchase in 2016, resulting in a cash usage of $7.695 billion during 2015, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net purchases and sales of marketable securities available for sale. Net purchases of marketable securities available for sale during 2016 amounted to a net cash usage of $647.7 million during 2016 compared to net cash proceeds of $1.910 billion from net sales of marketable securities available for sale during 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $4.821 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to $7.695 billion of payments for the acquisitions of Receptos and Quanticel, net of cash acquired. This was partially offset by net proceeds of $1.910 billion from net sales of marketable securities available-for-sale during 2015 compared with $485.5 million of net purchases of marketable securities available-for-sale during 2014. In addition, $710.0 million was used for the acquisition of Nogra in 2014.\nFinancing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $1.646 billion in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $4.585 billion in 2015. The decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the 2015 issuance of long-term debt which provided $7.913 billion.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased by $5.002 billion in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the $5.443 billion increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt partially offset by the $513.9 million re-payment of long-term debt.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in millions):\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior notes1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,024.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,900.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,884.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,666.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,475.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>213.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contract commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>172.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,253.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,039.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,932.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,701.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,927.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1\n</td> <td>The senior note obligation amounts include future principal and interest payments for both current and non-current obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSenior Notes: In August 2015, we issued an additional $8.000 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Senior Notes due 2018, $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.875% Senior Notes due 2020, $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.550% Senior Notes due 2022, $2.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.875% Senior Notes due 2025 and $2.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2045.\nIn May 2014, we issued a total of $2.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.250% Senior Notes due 2019, $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2024 and $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2044.\nIn August 2013, we issued a total of $1.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.300% Senior Notes due 2018, $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% Senior Notes due 2023 and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% Senior Notes due 2043.\nIn August 2012, we issued a total of $1.500 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.90% Senior Notes due 2017, and $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Senior Notes due 2022.\nIn October 2010, we issued a total of $1.250 billion principal amount of senior notes consisting of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.45% Senior Notes which matured and were repaid in 2015, $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.95% Senior Notes due 2020 and $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.7% Senior Notes due 2040.\nOperating Leases: We lease office and research facilities under various operating lease agreements in the United States and various international markets. The non-cancelable lease terms for operating leases expire at various dates between 2017 and 2025 and include renewal options. In general, we are also required to reimburse the lessors for real estate taxes, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other operating costs associated with the leases. For more information on the major facilities that we occupy under lease arrangements refer to Part I, Item 2. \"Properties\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Contract Commitments: Other contract commitments of $238.2 million as of December 31, 2016 primarily included $172.2 million in contractual obligations related to product supply contracts. In addition, we have committed to invest an aggregate $66.0 million in investment funds, which are callable at any time.\nCollaboration Arrangements and Acquired Research and Development Assets: We have entered into certain research and development collaboration agreements with third parties and have acquired research and development assets from third parties with the potential for future milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of pre-established developmental, regulatory and/or commercial targets. Our obligation to fund these efforts is contingent upon continued involvement in the programs and/or the lack of any adverse events which could cause the discontinuance of the programs. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the future potential payments related to the attainment of specified development, regulatory approval and sales-based milestones\nover a period of several years are inherently uncertain, and accordingly, no amounts have been recorded for these future potential payments in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2016 and 2015 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Potential milestone payments (not including potential royalty payments) total approximately $8.568 billion, including approximately $4.006 billion contingent on the achievement of various research, development and regulatory approval milestones and approximately $4.562 billion in sales-based milestones. For additional information about our collaboration arrangements and acquisitions of research and development assets, see Note 17 and Note 2, respectively, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of new accounting standards please see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting estimates and policies to be critical:\nRevenue Recognition: Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when title and risk of loss of the product is transferred to the customer and the sales price is fixed and determinable. Provisions for discounts, early payments, rebates, sales returns and distributor chargebacks under terms customary in the industry are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. We record estimated reductions to revenue for volume-based discounts and rebates at the time of the initial sale. The estimated reductions to revenue for such volume-based discounts and rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience and trend analysis.\nWe recognize revenue from royalties based on licensees' sales of our products or products using our technologies. Royalties are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. If royalties cannot be reasonably estimated or collectability of a royalty amount is not reasonably assured, royalties are recognized as revenue when the cash is received.\nGross to Net Sales Accruals: We base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.\nSales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.\nGovernment rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. We will continue to adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience.\nManufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-\nsponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.\nRebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.\nChargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts: We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts primarily based on the credit worthiness of our customers, historical payment patterns, aging of receivable balances and general economic conditions, including publicly available information on the credit worthiness of countries themselves and provinces or areas within such countries where they are the ultimate customers.\nIncome Taxes: We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. We provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe account for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for income taxes. These unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among multinational corporations in our industry. We apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include studies performed by independent economists, advice from industry and subject experts, evaluation of public actions taken by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities, as well as our own industry experience. We provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits. If our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes, our results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets, and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, various income tax strategies and other relevant factors. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent future expectations change, we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time. At December 31, 2016, it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances.\nShare-Based Compensation: We utilize share based compensation in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance-based restricted stock units, or PSUs. Compensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income based on the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date. Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period required to obtain full vesting. Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to determine whether PSU grants are expected to vest. If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized to date associated with grants that are not expected to vest will be reversed.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments of Available-For-Sale Marketable Securities: A decline in the market value of any available-for-sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to operations and a new cost basis for the security established. The determination of whether an available-for-sale marketable security is other-than-temporarily impaired requires significant judgment and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment. Factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired include: significant deterioration in the issuer's earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the issuer, adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates, length of time that the fair value has been below our cost, our expected future cash flows from the\nsecurity, our intent not to sell, an evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell before recovery of our cost basis, and issues that raise concerns about the issuer's ability to continue as a going concern. Assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions, which could differ from our assessment.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities: All derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedging transaction and, if it is, the type of hedging transaction. For a derivative to qualify as a hedge at inception and throughout the hedged period, we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged item. We assess, both at inception and on an on-going basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items. We assess hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion of derivative instruments, if any, to current earnings. If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting and any related unrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in current earnings. We use derivative instruments, including those not designated as part of a hedging transaction, to manage our exposure to movements in foreign exchange, our stock price and interest rates. The use of these derivative instruments modifies the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost.\nInvestments in Other Entities: We hold a portfolio of investments in equity securities and certain investment funds that are accounted for under either the equity method or cost method. Investments in companies or certain investment funds over which we have significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method, with our share of earnings or losses reported in other income (expense), net. Investments in equity securities of companies that become publicly traded are accounted for as available-for-sale marketable securities prospectively from the date of such companies' initial public offering.\nOur cost method and equity method investments are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAll investments are reviewed on a regular basis for possible impairment. If an investment's fair value is determined to be less than its net carrying value and the decline is determined to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its fair value. Such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on specific facts and circumstances. Factors considered in determining whether an other-than-temporary decline in value has occurred include: market value or exit price of the investment based on either market-quoted prices or future rounds of financing by the investee; length of time that the market value was below its cost basis; financial condition and business prospects of the investee; our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in market value of the investment; issues that raise concerns about the investee's ability to continue as a going concern; any other information that we may be aware of related to the investment.\nAccounting for Long-Term Incentive Plans: We have established a Long-Term Incentive Plan, or LTIP, designed to provide key officers and executives with performance-based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives covering a three-year period. At December 31, 2016, we had recorded liabilities for three separate three-year performance cycles running concurrently and ending December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Performance measures for each of the performance cycles are based on the following components: 37.5% on non-GAAP earnings per share (as defined in the LTIP); 37.5% on total non-GAAP revenue (as defined in the LTIP); and 25% on relative total shareholder return, which is a measurement of our stock price performance during the applicable three-year period compared with a group of other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.\nThreshold, target and maximum cash payout levels are calculated as a percentage between 0% to 200% of each participant's base salary at the time the LTIP was approved by the Compensation Committee. Such awards are payable in cash or common stock or a mixture of cash and common stock, which will be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of award delivery. Share-based payout levels are calculated using the cash-based threshold, target and maximum levels, divided by the average closing price of Celgene stock for the 30 trading days prior to the commencement of each performance cycle. Therefore, final share-based award values are reflective of the stock price at the end of the measurement period. The Compensation Committee may determine that payments made in common stock are restricted from trading for a period of time. We accrue the long-term incentive liability over each three-year cycle. Prior to the end of a three-year cycle, the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle. Upon a change in control, participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award or, if higher, an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control.\nAccruals recorded for the LTIP entail making certain assumptions concerning future non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP revenues and relative total shareholder return, as defined; the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used. Accruals for the LTIP are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts. In estimating the accruals, management considers actual results to date for the\nperformance period, expected results for the remainder of the performance period, operating trends, product development, pricing and competition.\nValuation of Goodwill, Acquired Intangible Assets, Other Assets and In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): We have recorded goodwill, acquired intangible assets and IPR&D through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations. When identifiable intangible assets, including in-process research and development and technology platforms are acquired, we determine the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations if quoted market prices are not available, and the models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>projecting regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects or estimating future cash flows expected to be collected; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting and is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of net assets are below their carrying amounts.\nIntangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment if certain events occur. Intangible assets related to IPR&D product rights are treated as indefinite-lived intangible assets and not amortized until the product is approved for sale by regulatory authorities in specified markets. At that time, we will determine the useful life of the asset, reclassify the asset out of IPR&D and begin amortization. Impairment testing is also performed at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. Such test entails completing an updated discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the IPR&D asset. If required, the impairment test for intangible assets with definite useful lives is completed by comparing an updated non-discounted cash flow model to the book value of the intangible asset.\nValuation of Contingent Consideration Resulting from a Business Combination: We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date, and for each subsequent reporting period revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating earnings in the consolidated statements of income. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from movements in publicly traded share prices of CVRs, adjustments to discount rates and periods, updates in the assumed achievement or timing of any development milestones or changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probability associated with regulatory approval. The assumptions related to determining the value of a contingent consideration include a significant amount of judgment and any changes in the assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period. Our contingent consideration liabilities were recorded in the acquisitions of Gloucester, Abraxis, Avila, Nogra, and Quanticel. The fair values of the Gloucester, Avila, Nogra, and Quanticel contingent consideration liabilities are based on the discount rate, probability and estimated timing of cash milestone payments to the former shareholders of each business. The fair value of the Abraxis contingent consideration liability is based on the quoted market price of the publicly traded CVRs.", "summary": "Celgene Corporation is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for cancer and inflammatory diseases. The company's revenue and earnings saw significant increases in 2016, driven by growth in product sales and reductions in collaboration-related expenses. The primary commercial stage products, REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, and THALOMID\u00ae, contributed to the revenue growth. Celgene continues to invest in research and development, with a focus on clinical development programs for multiple disease areas.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nCelgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d Celgene\u201d or the Company\u201d), is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Celgene Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986.\nOur primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae) and THALOMID\u00ae (sold as THALOMID\u00ae or Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae outside of the U.S.). In addition, we earn revenue from other product sales and licensing arrangements.\nWe continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. Our clinical trial activity includes trials across the disease areas of hematology, solid tumors, and inflammation and immunology. REVLIMID\u00ae is in several phase III trials covering a range of hematological malignancies that include multiple myeloma, lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In solid tumors, ABRAXANE\u00ae is currently in various stages of investigation for breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. In inflammation and immunology, OTEZLA\u00ae is being evaluated in phase III trials for Beh\u00e7et's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. We also have a growing number of potential products in phase III trials across multiple diseases. In the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area, we have phase III trials underway for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and for GED-0301 (mongersen) in Crohn's disease. In hematology, phase III trials are underway for CC-486 and luspatercept in MDS, for CC-486 and enasidenib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for luspatercept in beta-thalassemia. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted a new drug application (NDA) for enasidenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.\nBeyond our phase III programs, we have access to a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel potential therapies to address significant unmet medical needs that consists of new drug candidates and cell therapies developed in-house, licensed from other companies or able to be optioned from collaboration partners. We believe that continued use of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, potential regulatory approvals of new products and new indications for existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.\nThe following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):\n\nRevenue increased by $1.973 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae. The $397.2 million increase in net income and $0.55 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2016 as compared to 2015 were primarily due to a higher level of net product sales and a $601.9 million reduction in collaboration-related expenses, partly offset by increases in other expenses, including $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab AG (EngMab), Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Acetylon), and Triphase Research and Development I Corporation (Triphase), $345.3 million of increased impairment charges related to strategic equity investments, which included $272.2 million related to our equity investment in Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (Juno), an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily due to a $198.5 million litigation-related loss contingency accrual expense, and an $83.1 million impairment charge related to the technology platform obtained in our 2012 acquisition of Avila Therapeutics, Inc. (Avila).\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Years Ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nTotal Revenue: Total revenue and related percentages by product for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n\nN/M - Not meaningful\nThe increase in total revenue of $1.973 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 reflected increases of $1.406 billion, or 25.1%, in the United States, and $567.7 million, or 15.5%, in international markets. The increase in total revenue of $1.586 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 reflected increases of $1.121 billion, or 25.0%, in the United States, and $464.4 million, or 14.6%, in international markets.\nNet Product Sales: Total net product sales for 2016 increased by $2.024 billion, or 22.1%, to $11.185 billion compared to 2015. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.680 billion and net price increases of $415.2 million, offset in part by a $71.2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID\u00ae and ABRAXANE\u00ae. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.\nTotal net product sales for 2015 increased by $1.597 billion, or 21.1%, to $9.161 billion compared to 2014. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.467 billion and net price increases of $239.8 million, offset in part by a $109.4 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, and ABRAXANE\u00ae, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID\u00ae. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.\nREVLIMID\u00ae net sales increased by $1.173 billion, or 20.2%, to $6.974 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets and price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID\u00ae in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains. REVLIMID\u00ae launched in the U.S. and EU for the Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma following approval in February 2015.\nNet sales of REVLIMID\u00ae increased by $821.1 million, or 16.5%, to $5.801 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets in addition to price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID\u00ae in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains.\nPOMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae net sales increased by $327.4 million, or 33.3%, to $1.311 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $777.5 million in the United States and $533.2 million in international markets. Increases in treatment duration\ncontributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae. Achieving reimbursement in additional countries, notably in Japan, also continues to contribute to the growth of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae net sales in international markets.\nNet sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae increased by $303.6 million, or 44.7%, to $983.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $591.8 million in the United States and $391.5 million in international markets. Increases in market share and treatment duration contributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae.\nOTEZLA\u00ae net sales increased by $545.5 million to $1.017 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $904.4 million in the United States and $112.8 million in international markets. 2016 was the second full year on the market in the U.S. Growth in the U.S. reflects increased market share and expanding accessibility to patients. Sales in international markets continued to expand during 2016, with growing sales in early launch countries in Europe and additional international approvals.\nNet sales of OTEZLA\u00ae increased by $401.9 million to $471.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $440.0 million in the United States and $31.7 million in international markets. OTEZLA\u00ae net sales were $69.8 million for 2014, primarily from sales in the United States. OTEZLA\u00ae was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. OTEZLA\u00ae was approved for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the EU in January 2015. Launch activities for OTEZLA\u00ae commenced in March 2014 and we began recognizing revenue related to OTEZLA\u00ae during the second quarter of 2014.\nABRAXANE\u00ae net sales increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6% to $973.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. U.S. sales of $633.8 million and international sales of $339.6 million decreased 3.0 percent and increased 8.2 percent, respectively. The increase in international sales was primarily due to increased unit sales, which were partially offset by price decreases. The decrease in U.S. sales was due to volume decreases partly offset by price increases. The decrease in U.S. sales reflects the increased competition in breast cancer and lung cancer indications from new market entrants.\nNet sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae increased by $119.3 million, or 14.1%, to $967.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit volumes in both the U.S. and international markets reflecting increased acceptance of the product for the treatment of both metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ABRAXANE\u00ae was approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as first-line treatment in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy in the European Union in March 2015.\nVIDAZA\u00ae net sales increased by $17.3 million, or 2.9%, to $608.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $26.6 million increase in international markets resulting from increased unit sales which were partly offset by price decreases in international markets and both volume and price decreases in the U.S. market.\nNet sales of VIDAZA\u00ae decreased by $21.2 million, or 3.5%, to $590.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $21.6 million decrease in U.S. sales resulting from the September 2013 introduction of a generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae by a competitor, which was partly offset by volume increases in international markets.\nAzacitidine for injection net sales decreased by $17.9 million, or 21.3%, to $66.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to price decreases partially offset by an increase in unit volumes. Azacitidine for injection is a generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae supplied by us to Sandoz AG (Sandoz).\nAzacitidine for injection net sales increased by $5.7 million, or 7.3%, to $83.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales to Sandoz, which were partly offset by price decreases.\nTHALOMID\u00ae net sales decreased by $33.3 million, or 18.0%, to $152.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes in the U.S.\nNet sales of THALOMID\u00ae decreased by $35.8 million, or 16.2%, to $185.4 million for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes and price decreases in both U.S. and international markets.\nISTODAX\u00ae net sales increased by $10.2 million, or 14.8%, to $79.3 million for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in unit volume as well as price increases.\nNet sales of ISTODAX\u00ae increased by $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $69.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in unit sales.\nThe \"other\" net product sales category, which includes sales of FOCALIN\u00ae, decreased by $4.1 million, to $4.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The \"other\" net product sales category decreased by $0.8 million to $8.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Revenue: Other revenue decreased by $50.3 million to $44.6 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $36.0 million decrease in royalty revenue from Novartis AG (Novartis) based upon its sales of both RITALIN\u00ae and FOCALIN XR\u00ae, both of which have been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets and we expect that trend to continue in 2017. Generic competition entered the market in the United States for certain strengths of FOCALIN XR in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nOther revenue decreased by $11.7 million to $94.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $14.1 million decrease in royalty revenue. The decrease in royalty revenue was driven by lower royalties earned from Novartis based on its sales of FOCALIN XR\u00ae and RITALIN\u00ae, which have both been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets.\nGross to Net Sales Accruals: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, chargebacks and distributor service fees.\nREVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), POMALYST REMS\u00ae and THALOMID REMS\u00ae programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae. Internationally, REVLIMID\u00ae, THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae and IMNOVID\u00ae are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the product's safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, ISTODAX\u00ae and VIDAZA\u00ae are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae.\nWe base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.\nSales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.\nGovernment rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-sponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.\nRebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.\nChargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.\nGross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions):\n\nA comparison of provisions for allowances for sales within each of the four categories noted above for 2016 and 2015 follows:\n2016 compared to 2015: Provisions for sales returns decreased by $5.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the ABRAXANE\u00ae allowances for sales returns being $5.0 million higher in 2015 than in 2016 due to an increase in inventory levels held by certain distributors in 2015. Provisions for sales returns also decreased by $1.0 million each for both REVLIMID\u00ae and ISTODAX\u00ae. These reductions were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in the returns allowance for OTEZLA\u00ae in 2016 primarily related to returns of product that had reached their expiration dates.\nDiscount provisions increased by $41.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $41.8 million increase consisted of a $37.7 million increase in the United States and a $4.1 million increase related to international markets. The U.S. increases included increases of $21.0 million for cash discounts related to REVLIMID\u00ae, $12.8 million related to OTEZLA\u00ae and $4.3 million related to POMALYST\u00ae.\nGovernment rebate provisions increased by $269.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $120.8 million increase in international government rebates. The increase in international government rebates was primarily driven by higher sales volumes for our primary products in Europe and increased international rebate rates, as well as an adjustment of our accrual to reflect higher rebate rates for IMNOVID\u00ae in France. The increase in the allowance for sales of IMNOVID\u00ae in France related to prior periods was $15.1 million and the increase for sales of IMNOVID\u00ae in the current year due to higher rebate rates in France was $23.2 million. The $148.5 million increase in the U.S. market was primarily due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, with $107.7 million due to an increase in Medicaid rebates (primarily in the managed care channel) and $40.8 million due to an increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.\nChargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $211.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Chargebacks increased by approximately $140.4 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $71.4 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes, including an $11.4 million increase related to the TRICARE program driven by higher sales volume and increased rebate rates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA\u00ae, which accounted for $64.1 million of the increase in distributor service fees.\n2015 compared to 2014: Provisions for sales returns increased by $13.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in ABRAXANE\u00ae returns reserve allowance related to inventory levels held by certain distributors at the end of 2015. Higher net product sales volumes and elevated returns activity in the U.S. market also resulted in $6.0 million of increases in 2015. In addition, $4.8 million of reductions in returns reserves were recorded in 2014 for the migration of THALOMID\u00ae to specialty pharmacies and for VIDAZA\u00ae inventory levels held at distributors following competition from generic versions of VIDAZA\u00ae. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to POMALYST\u00ae in 2015 due to lower returns activity.\nDiscount provisions increased by $23.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $23.8 million increase consisted of a $24.3 million increase in the United States, which included increases of $13.4 million of cash discounts related to REVLIMID\u00ae, $8.9 million related to OTEZLA\u00ae and $3.0 million related to POMALYST\u00ae. The U.S. increases were partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease related to international cash discounts.\nGovernment rebate provisions increased by $132.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $97.9 million increase in international government rebates, due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, and a $26.4 million increase related to Medicaid rebates due to increased sales and Medicaid expansion and a $8.1 million increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.\nChargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $164.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Chargebacks increased by approximately $102.1 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $62.0 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes and a greater portion of sales qualifying for chargeback rebates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA\u00ae, which launched in April 2014, resulting in an increase of $49.3 million in service fees for 2015.\nCost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets): Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n\nCost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $17.9 million to $438.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 3.9% for 2016 compared to 4.6% for 2015, primarily due to OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae and azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.\nCost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $34.2 million to $420.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. The changing mix of product sales toward lower cost products that was seen in 2016 compared to 2015 also occurred in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 4.6% for 2015 compared to 5.1% for 2014, primarily due to OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae and azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.\nResearch and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and milestone payments resulting from collaboration arrangements and expenses for research and development asset acquisitions.\nResearch and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\n\nResearch and development expenses increased by $772.8 million to $4.470 billion in 2016, compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExecutive Summary\nCelgene Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d Celgene\u201d or the Company\u201d), is an integrated global biopharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases through next-generation solutions in protein homeostasis, immuno-oncology, epigenetics, immunology and neuro-inflammation. Celgene Corporation was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1986.\nOur primary commercial stage products include REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, azacitidine for injection (generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae) and THALOMID\u00ae (sold as THALOMID\u00ae or Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae outside of the U.S.). In addition, we earn revenue from other product sales and licensing arrangements.\nWe continue to invest substantially in research and development in support of multiple ongoing proprietary clinical development programs which support our existing products and pipeline of new drug candidates. Our clinical trial activity includes trials across the disease areas of hematology, solid tumors, and inflammation and immunology. REVLIMID\u00ae is in several phase III trials covering a range of hematological malignancies that include multiple myeloma, lymphomas and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In solid tumors, ABRAXANE\u00ae is currently in various stages of investigation for breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers. In inflammation and immunology, OTEZLA\u00ae is being evaluated in phase III trials for Beh\u00e7et's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. We also have a growing number of potential products in phase III trials across multiple diseases. In the inflammation and immunology therapeutic area, we have phase III trials underway for ozanimod in relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and for GED-0301 (mongersen) in Crohn's disease. In hematology, phase III trials are underway for CC-486 and luspatercept in MDS, for CC-486 and enasidenib in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for luspatercept in beta-thalassemia. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we submitted a new drug application (NDA) for enasidenib for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation.\nBeyond our phase III programs, we have access to a growing early-to-mid-stage pipeline of novel potential therapies to address significant unmet medical needs that consists of new drug candidates and cell therapies developed in-house, licensed from other companies or able to be optioned from collaboration partners. We believe that continued use of our primary commercial stage products, participation in research and development collaboration arrangements, depth of our product pipeline, potential regulatory approvals of new products and new indications for existing products will provide the catalysts for future growth.\nThe following table summarizes total revenue and earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (dollar amounts in millions, except per share data):\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2016\nversus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\nversus\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,229.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,256.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,670.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,999.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,602.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,999.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue increased by $1.973 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the continued growth in sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae. The $397.2 million increase in net income and $0.55 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2016 as compared to 2015 were primarily due to a higher level of net product sales and a $601.9 million reduction in collaboration-related expenses, partly offset by increases in other expenses, including $892.9 million of research and development asset acquisition expense associated with the purchases of EngMab AG (EngMab), Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Acetylon), and Triphase Research and Development I Corporation (Triphase), $345.3 million of increased impairment charges related to strategic equity investments, which included $272.2 million related to our equity investment in Juno Therapeutics, Inc.

The increase in total revenue of $1.586 billion in 2015 compared to 2014 reflected increases of $1.121 billion, or 25.0%, in the United States, and $464.4 million, or 14.6%, in international markets.\nNet Product Sales: Total net product sales for 2016 increased by $2.024 billion, or 22.1%, to $11.185 billion compared to 2015. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.680 billion and net price increases of $415.2 million, offset in part by a $71.2 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID\u00ae and ABRAXANE\u00ae. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.\nTotal net product sales for 2015 increased by $1.597 billion, or 21.1%, to $9.161 billion compared to 2014. The increase was comprised of net volume increases of $1.467 billion and net price increases of $239.8 million, offset in part by a $109.4 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact, including the impact of foreign exchange hedging activity. The increase in volume was driven by increased unit sales of REVLIMID\u00ae, OTEZLA\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, and ABRAXANE\u00ae, partly offset by a decrease in unit sales of THALOMID\u00ae. The price impact was primarily attributable to price increases in the U.S. market.\nREVLIMID\u00ae net sales increased by $1.173 billion, or 20.2%, to $6.974 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets and price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID\u00ae in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains. REVLIMID\u00ae launched in the U.S. and EU for the Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma following approval in February 2015.\nNet sales of REVLIMID\u00ae increased by $821.1 million, or 16.5%, to $5.801 billion in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales in both U.S. and international markets in addition to price increases in the U.S. market. Increases in market penetration and treatment duration of patients using REVLIMID\u00ae in multiple myeloma contributed to the increase in U.S. unit sales. The growth in international markets resulted from volume increases, primarily driven by increased duration of use and market share gains.\nPOMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae net sales increased by $327.4 million, or 33.3%, to $1.311 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $777.5 million in the United States and $533.2 million in international markets. Increases in treatment duration\ncontributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae. Achieving reimbursement in additional countries, notably in Japan, also continues to contribute to the growth of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae net sales in international markets.\nNet sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae increased by $303.6 million, or 44.7%, to $983.3 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $591.8 million in the United States and $391.5 million in international markets. Increases in market share and treatment duration contributed to the increase in U.S. and international net sales of POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae.\nOTEZLA\u00ae net sales increased by $545.5 million to $1.017 billion in 2016 compared to 2015, reflecting net sales of $904.4 million in the United States and $112.8 million in international markets. 2016 was the second full year on the market in the U.S. Growth in the U.S. reflects increased market share and expanding accessibility to patients. Sales in international markets continued to expand during 2016, with growing sales in early launch countries in Europe and additional international approvals.\nNet sales of OTEZLA\u00ae increased by $401.9 million to $471.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, reflecting net sales of $440.0 million in the United States and $31.7 million in international markets. OTEZLA\u00ae net sales were $69.8 million for 2014, primarily from sales in the United States. OTEZLA\u00ae was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2014 for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis and in September 2014 for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. OTEZLA\u00ae was approved for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the EU in January 2015. Launch activities for OTEZLA\u00ae commenced in March 2014 and we began recognizing revenue related to OTEZLA\u00ae during the second quarter of 2014.\nABRAXANE\u00ae net sales increased by $5.9 million, or 0.6% to $973.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. U.S. sales of $633.8 million and international sales of $339.6 million decreased 3.0 percent and increased 8.2 percent, respectively. The increase in international sales was primarily due to increased unit sales, which were partially offset by price decreases. The decrease in U.S. sales was due to volume decreases partly offset by price increases. The decrease in U.S. sales reflects the increased competition in breast cancer and lung cancer indications from new market entrants.\nNet sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae increased by $119.3 million, or 14.1%, to $967.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit volumes in both the U.S. and international markets reflecting increased acceptance of the product for the treatment of both metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). ABRAXANE\u00ae was approved for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, as first-line treatment in combination with carboplatin, in patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation therapy in the European Union in March 2015.\nVIDAZA\u00ae net sales increased by $17.3 million, or 2.9%, to $608.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $26.6 million increase in international markets resulting from increased unit sales which were partly offset by price decreases in international markets and both volume and price decreases in the U.S. market.\nNet sales of VIDAZA\u00ae decreased by $21.2 million, or 3.5%, to $590.7 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $21.6 million decrease in U.S. sales resulting from the September 2013 introduction of a generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae by a competitor, which was partly offset by volume increases in international markets.\nAzacitidine for injection net sales decreased by $17.9 million, or 21.3%, to $66.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to price decreases partially offset by an increase in unit volumes. Azacitidine for injection is a generic version of VIDAZA\u00ae supplied by us to Sandoz AG (Sandoz).\nAzacitidine for injection net sales increased by $5.7 million, or 7.3%, to $83.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased unit sales to Sandoz, which were partly offset by price decreases.\nTHALOMID\u00ae net sales decreased by $33.3 million, or 18.0%, to $152.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes in the U.S.\nNet sales of THALOMID\u00ae decreased by $35.8 million, or 16.2%, to $185.4 million for 2015 compared to 2014, primarily resulting from lower unit volumes and price decreases in both U.S. and international markets.\nISTODAX\u00ae net sales increased by $10.2 million, or 14.8%, to $79.3 million for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to an increase in unit volume as well as price increases.\nNet sales of ISTODAX\u00ae increased by $3.5 million, or 5.3%, to $69.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in unit sales.\nThe \"other\" net product sales category, which includes sales of FOCALIN\u00ae, decreased by $4.1 million, to $4.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The \"other\" net product sales category decreased by $0.8 million to $8.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\nOther Revenue: Other revenue decreased by $50.3 million to $44.6 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a $36.0 million decrease in royalty revenue from Novartis AG (Novartis) based upon its sales of both RITALIN\u00ae and FOCALIN XR\u00ae, both of which have been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets and we expect that trend to continue in 2017. Generic competition entered the market in the United States for certain strengths of FOCALIN XR in the fourth quarter of 2013.\nOther revenue decreased by $11.7 million to $94.9 million for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to a $14.1 million decrease in royalty revenue. The decrease in royalty revenue was driven by lower royalties earned from Novartis based on its sales of FOCALIN XR\u00ae and RITALIN\u00ae, which have both been negatively impacted by generic competition in certain markets.\nGross to Net Sales Accruals: We record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and allowances, sales discounts, government rebates, chargebacks and distributor service fees.\nREVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae are distributed in the United States primarily through contracted pharmacies under the REVLIMID Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), POMALYST REMS\u00ae and THALOMID REMS\u00ae programs, respectively. These are proprietary risk-management distribution programs tailored specifically to provide for the safe and appropriate distribution and use of REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae. Internationally, REVLIMID\u00ae, THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae and IMNOVID\u00ae are distributed under mandatory risk-management distribution programs tailored to meet local authorities' specifications to provide for the product's safe and appropriate distribution and use. These programs may vary by country and, depending upon the country and the design of the risk-management program, the product may be sold through hospitals or retail pharmacies. OTEZLA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, ISTODAX\u00ae and VIDAZA\u00ae are distributed through the more traditional pharmaceutical industry supply chain and are not subject to the same risk-management distribution programs as REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae.\nWe base our sales returns allowance on estimated on-hand retail/hospital inventories, measured end-customer demand as reported by third-party sources, actual returns history and other factors, such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned or inventory centralization and rationalization initiatives conducted by major pharmacy chains, as applicable. If the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns, then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected. Under this methodology, we track actual returns by individual production lots. Returns on closed lots, that is, lots no longer eligible for return credits, are analyzed to determine historical returns experience. Returns on open lots, that is, lots still eligible for return credits, are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates. Any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance. As noted above, REVLIMID\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and THALOMID\u00ae/Thalidomide Celgene\u00ae are distributed primarily through hospitals and contracted pharmacies, which are typically subject to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and, thus, resulting in lower returns activity.\nSales discount accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers.\nGovernment rebate accruals are based on estimated payments due to governmental agencies for purchases made by third parties under various governmental programs. U.S. Medicaid rebate accruals are generally based on historical payment data and estimates of future Medicaid beneficiary utilization applied to the Medicaid unit rebate formula established by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services. The Medicaid rebate percentage was increased and extended to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations in March 2010. The accrual of the rebates associated with Medicaid Managed Care Organizations is calculated based on estimated historical patient data related to Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. We also analyze actual billings received from the states to further support the accrual rates. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are responsible for 50% of the patient's cost of branded prescription drugs related to the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap. In order to estimate the cost to us of this coverage gap responsibility, we analyze data for eligible Medicare Part D patients against data for eligible Medicare Part D patients treated with our products as well as the historical invoices. This expense is recognized throughout the year as costs are incurred. In certain international markets government-sponsored programs require rebates to be paid based on program specific rules and, accordingly, the rebate accruals are determined primarily on estimated eligible sales.\nRebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers, group purchasing organizations and end-user customers, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practices. Settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to 15 months from the date of sale. We record a provision for rebates at the time of sale based on contracted rates and historical redemption rates. Assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories, contract sales volumes and average contract pricing. We regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust the provision accordingly.\nChargeback accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs. Distributor service fee accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided. TRICARE is a health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense Military Health System that provides civilian health benefits for military personnel, military retirees and their dependents. TRICARE rebate accruals are included in chargeback accruals and are based on estimated Department of Defense eligible sales multiplied by the TRICARE rebate formula.\nSee Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies below for further discussion of gross to net sales accruals.\nGross to net sales accruals and the balance in the related allowance accounts for the years ended

for 2016 and 2015 follows:\n2016 compared to 2015: Provisions for sales returns decreased by $5.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the ABRAXANE\u00ae allowances for sales returns being $5.0 million higher in 2015 than in 2016 due to an increase in inventory levels held by certain distributors in 2015. Provisions for sales returns also decreased by $1.0 million each for both REVLIMID\u00ae and ISTODAX\u00ae. These reductions were partially offset by a $1.5 million increase in the returns allowance for OTEZLA\u00ae in 2016 primarily related to returns of product that had reached their expiration dates.\nDiscount provisions increased by $41.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $41.8 million increase consisted of a $37.7 million increase in the United States and a $4.1 million increase related to international markets. The U.S. increases included increases of $21.0 million for cash discounts related to REVLIMID\u00ae, $12.8 million related to OTEZLA\u00ae and $4.3 million related to POMALYST\u00ae.\nGovernment rebate provisions increased by $269.3 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to a $120.8 million increase in international government rebates. The increase in international government rebates was primarily driven by higher sales volumes for our primary products in Europe and increased international rebate rates, as well as an adjustment of our accrual to reflect higher rebate rates for IMNOVID\u00ae in France. The increase in the allowance for sales of IMNOVID\u00ae in France related to prior periods was $15.1 million and the increase for sales of IMNOVID\u00ae in the current year due to higher rebate rates in France was $23.2 million. The $148.5 million increase in the U.S. market was primarily due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, with $107.7 million due to an increase in Medicaid rebates (primarily in the managed care channel) and $40.8 million due to an increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.\nChargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $211.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Chargebacks increased by approximately $140.4 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $71.4 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes, including an $11.4 million increase related to the TRICARE program driven by higher sales volume and increased rebate rates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA\u00ae, which accounted for $64.1 million of the increase in distributor service fees.\n2015 compared to 2014: Provisions for sales returns increased by $13.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in ABRAXANE\u00ae returns reserve allowance related to inventory levels held by certain distributors at the end of 2015. Higher net product sales volumes and elevated returns activity in the U.S. market also resulted in $6.0 million of increases in 2015. In addition, $4.8 million of reductions in returns reserves were recorded in 2014 for the migration of THALOMID\u00ae to specialty pharmacies and for VIDAZA\u00ae inventory levels held at distributors following competition from generic versions of VIDAZA\u00ae. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease related to POMALYST\u00ae in 2015 due to lower returns activity.\nDiscount provisions increased by $23.8 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to increased sales volumes. The $23.8 million increase consisted of a $24.3 million increase in the United States, which included increases of $13.4 million of cash discounts related to REVLIMID\u00ae, $8.9 million related to OTEZLA\u00ae and $3.0 million related to POMALYST\u00ae. The U.S. increases were partly offset by a $0.5 million decrease related to international cash discounts.\nGovernment rebate provisions increased by $132.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to a $97.9 million increase in international government rebates, due to higher sales volumes and increased rebate rates, and a $26.4 million increase related to Medicaid rebates due to increased sales and Medicaid expansion and a $8.1 million increase in expense related to Medicare Part D Coverage Gap.\nChargebacks and distributor service fees provisions increased by $164.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. Chargebacks increased by approximately $102.1 million and distributor service fees increased by approximately $62.0 million. The chargeback increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes and a greater portion of sales qualifying for chargeback rebates. The distributor service fee increase was primarily attributable to OTEZLA\u00ae, which launched in April 2014, resulting in an increase of $49.3 million in service fees for 2015.\nCost of Goods Sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets): Cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>438.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>420.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>385.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of net product sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $17.9 million to $438.0 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 3.9% for 2016 compared to 4.6% for 2015, primarily due to OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae and azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.\nCost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) increased by $34.2 million to $420.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to the higher level of net product sales. The changing mix of product sales toward lower cost products that was seen in 2016 compared to 2015 also occurred in 2015 compared to 2014. As a percent of net product sales, cost of goods sold (excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets) decreased to 4.6% for 2015 compared to 5.1% for 2014, primarily due to OTEZLA\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae, which have lower cost, making up a higher percentage of net product sales, while sales of ABRAXANE\u00ae and azacitidine for injection, which have higher cost, made up a lower percentage of net product sales.\nResearch and Development: Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salary and benefit costs, third-party grants and fees paid to clinical research organizations, supplies, upfront and milestone payments resulting from collaboration arrangements and expenses for research and development asset acquisitions.\nResearch and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (dollar amounts in millions):\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,470.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,697.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,430.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>772.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,266.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>204.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent increase from prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased by $772.8 million to $4.470 billion in 2016, compared to 2015.
