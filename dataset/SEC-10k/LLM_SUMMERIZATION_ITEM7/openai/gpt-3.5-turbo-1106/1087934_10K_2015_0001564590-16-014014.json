We help contact centers around the world create effective customer experiences through our powerful cloud contact center contact routing, self-service and agent optimization software solutions. Our software solutions and services enable contact centers to operate more efficiently, optimize the cost and quality of every customer interaction, create new pathways to profit and ensure ongoing customer-centric business improvement and growth.\nWe began offering cloud software solutions to the contact center market in 2005. Our dynamic technology platform provides our customers a pay-as-you-go solution without the costs and complexities of premise-based systems. Our proven cloud delivery model provides compelling total cost of ownership savings over premise-based technology by reducing upfront capital expenditures, eliminating the expense of system management and maintenance fees, while providing agility that enables businesses to scale their technology as they grow.\nWe provide software which includes the following:\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Automatic call distributing\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Computer telephony integration\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Interactive voice response with speech recognition\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Outbound dialer\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> PBX and CRM integration\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> ECHO\u00ae agent service surveys and reports\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Workforce optimization\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Quality management\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Screen recording\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Interactive reporting tool\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTaken together, the inContact cloud software creates an integrated solution for contact centers, including those with distributed workforces-either at-home or multi-site.\nBusiness Developments\nIn March 2015, we issued $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) due April 1, 2022, unless earlier converted pursuant to their terms by the holders. Net proceeds from the Convertible Notes were approximately $111.2 million, net of transaction fees. The Convertible Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 2.50% per annum.\nOn January 13, 2016, we acquired AC2 Solutions, Inc. AC2, a Delaware corporation, which provides call center workforce optimization products and services. On February 9, 2016, we acquired certain technology, customers and equipment from Attensity, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which provides call center analytics products and services. The combined purchase consideration was approximately $18.5 million cash and 40,456 restricted shares of the Company's common stock valued at $370,000 that will vest over two years. An additional 505,700 restricted shares of our common stock were issued, but not included in the purchase consideration as the shares will vest as services are provided over a two-year period.\nWe expect the majority of the purchase price of these acquisitions to be allocated to goodwill and acquired intangible assets as the valuation of certain assets and liabilities is ongoing as of the date of this Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business\nWe continue to experience increases in Software segment revenue principally due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing through our initiatives in direct sales and through referral and reseller sales channel relationships. The Network connectivity segment net growth increase is attributable to the increase in Network connectivity revenue from our inContact customers, exceeding lost revenue from attrition of our Network connectivity only customers. We expect the Network connectivity revenue from our inContact cloud software solutions customers to continue to exceed the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers in 2016. We expect Software and Network connectivity segment revenue to continue to increase during 2016.\nThere has been an increase in costs of revenue during 2015 due to increased direct costs attributable to fees we pay to network connectivity service providers, for third party licensed technology, greater professional service and customer service personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) as we employ more personnel, including higher-paid employees with more developed skill sets to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network infrastructure costs to build out and maintain our platform, amortization of acquired technology and an increase in amortization of previously capitalized internal use software costs. However, the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales has decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to the increase in Software segment revenue in general and an increase in Software segment revenue from our reseller sales channel relationships. We expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase as we incur additional costs for network connectivity service providers and licensed technology, continue investing in our network infrastructure and operation and support activities to maintain high availability and quality of service, but we expect the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales to remain the same or to continue to decrease as we anticipate increases in revenue related to realized economies of scale in network infrastructure, personnel and customer support.\nSources of Revenue\nOur revenue is reported and recognized based on the type of services provided to the customer as follows:\nSoftware Revenue. Software revenue includes two main sources of revenue:\n(1) Software delivery and support of our inContact cloud software solutions that are provided on a monthly subscription basis and associated professional services. Because our customers purchasing software and support services on a monthly recurring basis do not have the right to take possession of the software, we consider these arrangements to be service contracts and are not within the scope of Industry Topic 985, Software. We generally bill monthly recurring subscription charges in arrears and recognize these charges in the period in which they are earned. In addition to the monthly recurring revenue, revenue is also received on a non-recurring basis for professional services or on a recurring basis related to improving a customer's contact center efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to utilization of the inContact cloud software solutions.\nFor subscription service contracts with multiple elements (hosted software, training, installation and long distance services), we follow the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25, Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements. In addition to the monthly recurring subscription revenue, we also derive revenue on a non-recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer's inContact cloud software solutions experience. Because our professional services, such as training and implementation, are not considered to have standalone value, we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services in multiple element arrangements and recognize such fees as revenue over the estimated life of the customer. Fees for network connectivity services in multiple element arrangements within the inContact cloud software solutions are based on usage and we recognize revenue in the same manner as fees for telecommunication services discussed in the Network Connectivity Services Revenue\u201d below.\n(2) Perpetual product and services revenues are primarily derived from the sale of licenses to our WFO on-premise software products and services. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, revenue is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nMany of our customers purchase a combination of software, service, hardware, post contract customer support ( PCS\u201d) and hosting. PCS provided to our customers includes technical software support services and unspecified software upgrades to customers on a when-and-if available basis.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to customers who purchase our products for resale and is generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a sell-in\u201d basis). We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. If a reseller develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally accepted, we defer the revenue until the receipt of cash. Our arrangements with resellers are periodically reviewed as our business and products change.\nThrough the year ended December 31, 2014, software revenue also includes the quarterly minimum purchase commitments from a related party reseller referred to in Part VI, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d During 2015 no revenue was earned under this agreement, as it ended in 2014 and was not renewed.\nNetwork Connectivity Service Revenue. Network Connectivity Services revenue is derived from network connectivity, such as dedicated transport, switched long distance and data services. These services are provided over our network or through third party network connectivity providers. Our network is the backbone of our subscription software and allows us to provide the all-in-one inContact cloud contact center software solutions. Revenue for the network connectivity usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer's call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated. Customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period. If the billing period spans more than one month, earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date.\nFurther information about our revenue recognition policies are disclosed at Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 1 - Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCosts of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCosts of Revenue\nCosts of revenue consist primarily of payments to third party network connectivity service providers for resold network connectivity services to our customers and for third party technology licenses. Costs of revenue also include personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for professional services, customer support and network operations organizations and equipment depreciation and expenses relating to our network infrastructure, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs, and allocated overhead, such as rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment. As a result, overhead expenses are included in costs of revenue and each operating expense category. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers and for third party technology licenses, which vary depending on our customers' usage of our inContact cloud software solutions, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase as we incur additional costs for network connectivity service providers and for third party technology licenses, continue investing in our network infrastructure and operation and support activities to maintain high availability and quality of service. As our business grows, we expect to realize economies of scale in network infrastructure and personnel costs related to professional services, customer support and network operations organizations.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing, including commissions and bonuses, advertising, marketing events, corporate communications, expenses, travel costs and allocated overhead. Since our Software segment revenue is delivered and, therefore, recognized over time, we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. We believe it is important to continue investing in selling and marketing to create brand awareness and lead generation opportunities, to increase market share and to support our reseller channels. Accordingly, we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support growth initiatives, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of the non-capitalized portion of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products, enhancement of existing products, quality assurance, market research, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality on a frequent basis, expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses, professional service fees and other corporate expenses related to the growth of our business and operations in the future. As such, we expect general and administrative expenses fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nResults of Operations\nResults of 2015 versus 2014\nThe following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 221,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,272\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,384\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,022\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,621\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (529\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,600\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,784\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,221\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue: Total revenues increased $50.2 million or 29% to $222.0 million during 2015 compared to revenues of $171.8 million during 2014. The increase relates to an increase of $42.9 million in Software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing efforts of our inContact cloud contact center software solutions through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the addition of revenue generated from the sale of Uptivity products and services since the acquisition in May 2014. Network connectivity segment revenue increased $7.3 million as the increase of Network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeded the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments. We did not recognize any revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments during 2015, as the minimum purchase commitment expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions. The growth in Software revenue during the period more than offset the decrease in Unify minimum purchase commitment revenue.\nCosts of revenue and gross margin: Costs of revenue increased $19.8 million or 22% to $107.9 million during 2015 compared to $88.1 million during 2014. Our gross margin increased 2 percentage points to 51% during 2015 from 49% during 2014. The increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offset increased costs attributable to third party licensed technology, greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network operations personnel costs and expenses relating our continued investment in network infrastructure and operation and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. In addition, lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing related to a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs contributed to the increase of gross margin.\nSelling and marketing: Selling and marketing expense increased $15.2 million or 30% to $66.4 million during 2015 from $51.2 million during 2014. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions for direct and channel sales employees, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nResearch and development: Research and development expense increased $6.9 million or 31% to $29.3 million during 2015 compared to $22.4 million during 2014. The increase relates to our efforts to expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our product and service offerings and develop new technologies primarily through headcount additions, including the Uptivity acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense increased $5.9 million or 20% to $35.2 million during 2015 compared to $29.4 million during 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs and costs incurred to support our domestic and international business expansion. These increases were offset in part by decreases in acquisition costs and fees accrued for state sales taxes as we commenced collecting state sales taxes from our customers for applicable states in July 2015.\nOther expense: Other expense increased $5.0 million to $5.4 million during 2015 from $362,000 for 2014. The increase is primarily due to $5.2 million of interest related to the $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Notes we issued on March 30, 2015. See Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 7 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.\u201d\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes for 2015 was $529,000 compared to $9.1 million benefit for the same period in 2014. The income tax benefit in 2014 was due to recording a deferred tax liability upon acquisition of Uptivity related to a reduction of carrying value of deferred revenue and acquisition of intangibles for which no tax benefit will be derived. The reduction of carrying value and acquired intangibles resulted in a partial reversal of the valuation allowance upon consolidation.\nResults of 2014 versus 2013\nThe following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,272\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,479\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,793\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (351\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,804\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (373\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,203\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (360\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue: Total revenues increased $41.7 million or 32% to $171.8 million during 2014 compared to revenues of $130.0 million during 2013. The increase relates to an increase of $31.9 million in Software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing efforts of our inContact cloud contact center software solutions through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the $12.6 million of revenue generated from the sale of Uptivity software products and service since the acquisition in May 2014. Network connectivity segment revenue increased $9.8 million as the increase of Network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeded the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 and $6.8 million software revenue during 2013 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's 2014 and 2013 quarterly minimum purchase commitments. Under the arrangement, revenue from resold software services reduces Unify's obligation up to the amount of the quarterly minimum purchase commitments. These minimum purchase commitments were negotiated, in part to mitigate the risks associated with the investment in infrastructure to support our expanded reseller sales and marketing efforts and expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nCosts of revenue and gross margin: Costs of revenue increased $20.8 million or 31% to $88.1 million during 2014 compared to $67.4 million during 2013. Our gross margin increased one percentage point to 49% during 2014 from 48% during 2013. The increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offset increased costs attributable to greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. In addition, lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing related to a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs contributed to the increase of gross margin.\nSelling and marketing: Selling and marketing expense increased $14.0 million or 37% to $51.2 million during 2014 from $37.2 million during 2013. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions, including from the Uptivity acquisition, for direct and channel sales employees, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues and headcount and to a lesser extent, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nResearch and development: Research and development expense increased $9.8 million or 78% to $22.4 million during 2014 compared to $12.6 million during 2013. The increase relates to our efforts to expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our product and service offerings and develop new technologies primarily through headcount additions, including the Uptivity acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense increased $7.0 million or 32% to $29.4 million during 2014 compared to $22.3 million during 2013. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs and costs incurred to support our domestic and international business expansion, including Uptivity acquisition related costs.\nIncome taxes: Benefit (provision) for income taxes during 2014 was $9.1 million compared to ($373,000) for the same period in 2013. The income tax benefit during 2014 was due to recording a deferred tax liability upon acquisition of Uptivity related to a reduction of carrying value of deferred revenue and acquisition of intangibles for which no tax benefit will be derived. The reduction of carrying value and acquired intangibles resulted in a partial reversal of the valuation allowance upon consolidation.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate under two business segments: Software and Network connectivity. The Software segment includes all monthly recurring subscription revenue related to the delivery of our software solutions, revenue related to Uptivity products, associated professional services and setup fees, and revenue related to minimum purchase commitments from Unify through July 2014. The Network connectivity segment includes all voice and data long distance services provided to customers.\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on operating data (revenue, costs of revenue, and other operating expenses). Management does not evaluate and manage segment performance based on assets.\nFor segment reporting, we classify operating expenses as either direct\u201d or indirect.\u201d Direct expense refers to costs attributable solely to either selling and marketing efforts or research and development efforts. Indirect expense refers to costs that management considers to be overhead in running the business. Management evaluates expenditures for both selling and marketing and research and development efforts at the segment level without the allocation of overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment.\nSoftware Segment Results\nThe following is a tabular presentation and comparison of our Software segment condensed operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct selling and\nmarketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and\ndevelopment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Indirect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,682\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (37,533\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,710\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of 2015 versus 2014\nThe Software segment revenue increased $42.9 million or 43% to $143.7 million during 2015 from $100.8 million during 2014. The increase relates primarily to revenue generated from our inContact cloud contact center solutions and is due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the $20.4 million of revenue generated from the sales of Uptivity products in 2015, up from $12.6 million in 2014.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments. We did not recognize any revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments during 2015, as the minimum purchase commitment expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part 1V, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions\u201d. The growth in Software revenue during the period more than offset the decrease in Unify minimum purchase commitment revenue.\nSoftware segment revenue also includes revenue from professional and customer support services of $14.7 million for 2015 compared to $10.5 million for 2014.\nGross margin increased two percentage points to 59% in 2015 compared to 57% in 2014. The increase in gross margin is primarily a result of the increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offsetting increased costs attributable to third party licensed technology, greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network operations personnel costs and expenses relating our continued investment in network infrastructure and operation and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions.\nDirect selling and marketing expenses in the Software segment increased $14.6 million or 32% to $60.1 million in 2015 compared to $45.4 million during 2014. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions, including from the Uptivity acquisition, for direct and channel sales employees focused on managing and enhancing our partner relationships, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues and headcount and to a lesser extent, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nWe also continue to develop the software application and service provided in the Software segment by investing in research and development. During 2015 we incurred $27.6 million in direct research and development costs compared to $21.0 million during 2014 and have capitalized an additional $10.1 million of costs incurred during 2015 related to our internally developed software compared to $11.0 million during 2014.\nIndirect expenses, which consists of overhead, such as allocated general and administrative expenses, rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment, increased $6.6 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due to the general increase in indirect expenses and more indirect costs being allocated to the Software segment with the increasing investment in the Software segment.\nResults of 2014 versus 2013\nThe Software segment revenue increased $31.9 million or 46% to $100.8 million during 2014 from $68.9 million during 2013. The increase relates primarily to revenue generated from our inContact cloud contact center solutions and is due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the $12.6 million of revenue generated from the sales of Uptivity products and services since the acquisition in May 2014.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 and $6.8 million of software revenue during 2013 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's 2014 and 2013 quarterly minimum purchase commitments. Under the arrangement, revenue from resold software services reduced Unify's obligation up to the amount of the quarterly minimum purchase commitments. These minimum purchase commitments were negotiated, in part, to mitigate the risks associated with the investment in infrastructure to support our expanded reseller sales and marketing efforts and expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\nSoftware segment revenue also includes revenue from professional and customer support services of $10.5 million for 2014 compared to $5.7 million for 2013.\nGross margin decreased two percentage point to 57% in 2014 compared to 59% in 2013. The decrease in gross margin in primarily a result of increased costs incurred for professional service personnel brought on to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions.\nDirect selling and marketing expenses in the Software segment increased $13.7 million or 43% to $45.4 million in 2014 compared to $31.7 million during 2013. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions, including from the Uptivity acquisition, for direct and channel sales employees focused on managing and enhancing our partner relationships, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues and headcount and to a lesser extent, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nWe also continue to develop the software application and service provided in the Software segment by investing in research and development. During 2014 we incurred $21.0 million in direct research and development costs compared to $11.6 million during 2013 and have capitalized an additional $11.0 million of costs incurred during 2014 related to our internally developed software compared to $6.2 million during 2013.\nIndirect expenses, which consists of overhead, such as allocated general and administrative expenses, rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment, increased $7.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013 due to the general increase in indirect expenses and more indirect costs being allocated to the Software segment with the increasing investment in the Software segment.\nNetwork Connectivity Segment Results\nThe following is a tabular presentation and comparison of our Network connectivity

2014\nNetwork connectivity segment revenue increased $7.3 million or 10% to $78.3 million during 2015 from $71.0 million in 2014 due to the increase of network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeding the attrition of our network connectivity only customers. Our costs of revenue increased 8% due to the increase in revenue; however, Network connectivity gross margin increased two percentage points to 38% up from 36% in 2014 due to lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing from a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 1%. Indirect expenses, which consist of overhead, such as allocated general and administrative expenses, rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment, increased 5% during 2015 compared to 2014.\nResults of 2014 versus 2013\nNetwork connectivity segment revenue increased $9.8 million or 16% to $71.0 million during 2014 from $61.1 million in 2013 due to the increase of network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeding the attrition of our network connectivity only customers. Our costs of revenue increased 15% due to the increase in revenue, and Network connectivity gross margin remained constant at 36%. Selling and marketing expenses decreased 1%. Indirect expenses, which consist of overhead, such as allocated general and administrative expenses, rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment, increased 2% during 2014 compared to 2013.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCurrent Financial Condition\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash available from borrowings under a revolving credit loan agreement ( Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) with Zions First National Bank ( Zions\u201d), which expires in July 2016. At December 31, 2015, we had $29.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $75.1 million of short-term investments. In addition, we have access to additional available borrowings of $15.0 million under our Revolving Credit Agreement with Zions, subject to meeting our covenant requirements. The Revolving Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all our assets.\nOn March 30, 2015, we issued $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) due April 1, 2022, unless earlier converted by the holder pursuant to their terms. Net proceeds from the Convertible Notes were approximately $111.2 million, net of transaction fees. The Convertible Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 2.50% per annum. See Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 7 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.\u201d\nWe continue to take a proactive approach in managing our operating expenditures and cash flow from operations. We expect to rely on internally generated cash, our Revolving Credit Agreement and the proceeds from the Convertible Notes to finance operations and capital requirements.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, continuing market acceptance of our solution, customer retention, ability to gain new customers, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, and the introduction of new and enhanced offerings. We may also acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies and intellectual property rights.\nWe believe our existing cash, short-term investments and the amounts available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our needs during the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nIn summary, our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash from operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100,247\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (37,374\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,027\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash from financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe experienced a net loss of $22.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in operating activities is significantly influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business. During 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 million. Significant non-cash expenses affecting operations during 2015 included $22.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $8.8 million of stock-based compensation and $3.1 million of accreted interest related to the Convertible Notes. See Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 7 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.\u201d\nUses of working capital include a $9.1 million increase in accounts receivables primarily related to our revenue growth, a $2.9 million increase in other current assets principally related to increased software maintenance expenses that support our network infrastructure and operations. Sources of working capital include a $3.4 million increase in deferred revenue related primarily to our perpetual software products and services and a $1.2 million increase in accrued commissions primarily related to increases in our revenue.\nWe used $100.4 million for investing activities primarily for the purchases and maturities of available-for-sale short-term investments. Additionally we used $14.6 million for purchases of equipment primarily for use within our network infrastructure and $10.1 million of capitalization of internally developed software costs.\nFinancing activity provided $92.0 million related primarily to borrowings under the Convertible Notes and the exercise of stock options, partially offset by payments against the revolving line of credit and principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations, which were fully paid as of December 31, 2015.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn July 16, 2009, we entered into our Revolving Credit Agreement with Zions, which was subsequently amended in June 2013 and August 2014. Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement, Zions agreed to loan up to $15.0 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all the assets of inContact. The balance outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement cannot exceed the lesser of (a) $15.0 million or (b) the sum of 85% of eligible billed receivables, and 65% of eligible earned, but unbilled receivables as calculated on the 5th and 20th of each month. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Agreement with Zions is 4.0% per annum above the ninety day LIBOR. We drew $11.0 million on the Revolving Credit Agreement in 2014, which was repaid in March 2015. There was $15.0 million of unused commitment at December 31, 2015, based on the maximum available advance amount calculated on the December 20, 2015 borrowing base certificate. Interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement is paid monthly in arrears. In August 2014, we amended certain terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement with Zions ( Amendment\u201d). The Amendment extended the term from July 2015 to July 2016, added the Uptivity subsidiary as a guarantor of obligations arising under the loan agreement, pledged Uptivity's assets to Zions as additional security, increased the financial covenant of minimum quarterly EBITDA from $2.5 million to $2.9 million, which is only applicable if net cash is less than $2.5 million, increased the amount of permitted additional debt from $200,000 to $600,000 per borrowing for each of the calendar years ending December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and $200,000 for each calendar year thereafter, and increased the outstanding principal amount of our additional debt due at any time from $500,000 to $1.2 million for each of the calendar years ending December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and $500,000 for each calendar year thereafter. There was no outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Agreement at December 31, 2015.\nThe Zions Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, which were established by amendment to the Revolving Credit Agreement in August 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the most significant covenants require that the aggregate value of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities shall not be less than the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Agreement plus $2.5 million, and if at any time the aggregate value is less than the minimum liquidity position, a minimum quarterly EBITDA of $2.9 million, calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter, is required. We are in compliance with the Revolving Credit Agreement's covenants at December 31, 2015.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement imposes certain restrictions on inContact's ability, without the approval of Zions, to incur additional debt, make distributions to stockholders, or acquire other businesses or assets.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements. However, we have purchase commitments with national network connectivity providers, long term debt, operating leases, and hosting services. The following table discloses aggregate information about our material contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 2-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years 4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible Notes obligation, including\ninterest (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 132,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 118,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations - hosting services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The Convertible Note obligation reflected above includes projected interest payments over the term of the Convertible Note as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our critical estimates giving consideration to a combination of factors, including historical experience, current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below.\nRevenue Recognition: Revenue is recognized when all of the following four criteria are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) the fee is fixed or determinable, (3) collection is reasonably assured, and (4) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report.\nOur revenue is reported and recognized based on the type of services provided to the customer as follows:\nSoftware Revenue. Software revenue includes two main sources of revenue:\n(1) Software delivery and support of our inContact cloud software solutions that are provided on a monthly subscription basis and associated professional services. Because our customers purchasing software and support services on a monthly recurring basis do not have the right to take possession of the software, we consider these arrangements to be service contracts and are not within the scope of Industry Topic 985, Software. We generally bill monthly recurring subscription charges in arrears and recognize these charges in the period in which they are earned. In addition to the monthly recurring revenue, revenue is also received on a non-recurring basis for professional services or on a recurring basis related to improving a customer's contact center efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to utilization of the inContact cloud software solutions.\nFor subscription service contracts with multiple elements (hosted software, training, installation and long distance services), we follow the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25, Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements. In addition to the monthly recurring subscription revenue, we also derive revenue on a non-recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer's inContact cloud software solutions experience. Because our professional services, such as training and implementation, are not considered to have standalone value, we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services in multiple element arrangements and recognize such fees as revenue over the estimated life of the customer. Fees for network connectivity services in multiple element arrangements within the inContact cloud software solutions are based on usage and we recognize revenue in the same manner as fees for telecommunication services discussed in the Network Connectivity Services Revenue\u201d below.\n(2) Perpetual product and services revenues are primarily derived from the sale of licenses to our WFO on-premise software products and services. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, revenue is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nMany of our customers purchase a combination of software, service, hardware, post contract customer support ( PCS\u201d) and hosting. For software and software related multiple element arrangements that fall within the scope of the software revenue guidance in Topic 985, Software, we allocate revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual method, whereby revenue is allocated to the undelivered elements based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value ( VSOE\u201d) of the undelivered elements with the remaining arrangement fee allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. If we are unable to establish VSOE for the undelivered elements of the arrangement, including PCS, revenue recognition is deferred for the entire arrangement until all elements of the arrangement are delivered. PCS provided to our customers includes technical software support services and unspecified software upgrades to customers on a when-and-if available basis. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period, which is typically 15 months. When PCS is included within a multiple element arrangement, we utilize the bell-shaped curve approach to establish VSOE for the PCS. Under the bell-shaped curve approach of establishing VSOE, we perform a VSOE compliance test on a quarterly basis to ensure that a substantial majority of our actual PCS renewals are within a sufficiently narrow range.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to customers who purchase our products for resale and is generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a sell-in\u201d basis). We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. If a reseller develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally accepted, we defer the revenue until the receipt of cash. Our arrangements with resellers are periodically reviewed as our business and products change.\nThrough the quarter ended September 30, 2014, software revenue also includes the quarterly minimum purchase commitments from a related party reseller (Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions\u201d).\nNetwork Connectivity Service Revenue. Network Connectivity Services revenue is derived from network connectivity, such as dedicated transport, switched long distance and data services. These services are provided over our network or through third party network connectivity providers. Our network is the backbone of our subscription software and allows us to provide the all-in-one inContact cloud software solutions. Revenue for the network connectivity usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer's call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated. Customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period. If the billing period spans more than one month, earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date.\nGoodwill: We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment as of the end of the third quarter, and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two-step process. The first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. In performing the first step, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit by using a combination of discounted cash flow valuation approach and a market-based valuation approach utilizing a multiple of revenues. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including judgments about discount rates, cash flows attributable to the intangible assets, the terminal growth rates and relevant revenue multiples of comparable companies. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is required to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. In other words, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nUpon completion of the impairment tests as of September 30, 2015, no indication of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment existed. There were no events or circumstances from the date of assessment through December 31, 2015 that would impact this assessment.\nStock-based Compensation: We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC 718-10, Compensation-Stock Compensation. ASC 718-10 requires measurement of compensation cost for equity-based awards (i.e., stock options, warrants and restricted stock units) at fair value on date of grant and recognition of the fair value of compensation for awards expected to vest over the requisite service period.\nWe utilize the graded-vesting method, rather than a straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense as management believes this graded-vesting method more closely matches the expense to associated services. Prior to December 31, 2013, stock grants are generally subject to a three-year vesting period and subsequent to December 31, 2013 they are generally subject to a four-year vesting period. Under this method, nearly 60% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a three-year vesting term and 50% of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a four-year vesting term. The estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results differ from these estimates, such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised. Management considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types of awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results may differ substantially from these estimates.\nInternal Use Software: We capitalize certain costs incurred for the development of internal use software, which are included as internal use software in property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets. These costs include the costs associated with coding, software configuration, upgrades and enhancements that are incurred during the application development stage.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d-Note 1- Accounting Policies\u201d for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of inContact's financial condition and results of operations, organized into several sections including an overview, consolidated and segment results of operations, liquidity and capital resources, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements, and critical accounting estimates.

supplement to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to help provide an understanding of inContact's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. MD&A is organized as follows:\nOverview. This section provides a general description of our business, as well as developments we believe are important in understanding the results of operations and financial condition or in understanding anticipated future trends.\nConsolidated Results of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nSegment Results of Operations. This section provides an analysis of our segment results of operations for the three years ended December 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for the three years ended December 31, 2015, as well as a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments that existed as of December 31, 2015. Included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund our future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. This section provides a tabular presentation of our outstanding contractual obligations that existed as of December 31, 2015.\nCritical Accounting Estimates. This section discusses accounting estimates that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and require estimates on the part of management in application. Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d-Note 1- Accounting Policies.\u201d\nOverview\ninContact began in 1997 as a reseller of network connectivity services and has evolved to become a leading provider of cloud contact center software solutions. We help contact centers around the world create effective customer experiences through our powerful cloud contact center contact routing, self-service and agent optimization software solutions. Our software solutions and services enable contact centers to operate more efficiently, optimize the cost and quality of every customer interaction, create new pathways to profit and ensure ongoing customer-centric business improvement and growth.\nWe began offering cloud software solutions to the contact center market in 2005. Our dynamic technology platform provides our customers a pay-as-you-go solution without the costs and complexities of premise-based systems. Our proven cloud delivery model provides compelling total cost of ownership savings over premise-based technology by reducing upfront capital expenditures, eliminating the expense of system management and maintenance fees, while providing agility that enables businesses to scale their technology as they grow.\nWe provide software which includes the following:\n \u25cf Automatic call distributing \n \u25cf Computer telephony integration \n \u25cf Interactive voice response with speech recognition \n \u25cf Outbound dialer \n \u25cf PBX and CRM integration \n \u25cf ECHO\u00ae agent service surveys and reports \n \u25cf Workforce optimization \n \u25cf Quality management \n \u25cf Screen recording \n \u25cf Interactive reporting tool \nTaken together, the inContact cloud software creates an integrated solution for contact centers, including those with distributed workforces-either at-home or multi-site.\nBusiness Developments\nIn March 2015, we issued $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) due April 1, 2022, unless earlier converted pursuant to their terms by the holders. Net proceeds from the Convertible Notes were approximately $111.2 million, net of transaction fees. The Convertible Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 2.50% per annum.\nOn January 13, 2016, we acquired AC2 Solutions, Inc. AC2, a Delaware corporation, which provides call center workforce optimization products and services. On February 9, 2016, we acquired certain technology, customers and equipment from Attensity, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which provides call center analytics products and services. The combined purchase consideration was approximately $18.5 million cash and 40,456 restricted shares of the Company's common stock valued at $370,000 that will vest over two years. An additional 505,700 restricted shares of our common stock were issued, but not included in the purchase consideration as the shares will vest as services are provided over a two-year period.\nWe expect the majority of the purchase price of these acquisitions to be allocated to goodwill and acquired intangible assets as the valuation of certain assets and liabilities is ongoing as of the date of this Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business\nWe continue to experience increases in Software segment revenue principally due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing through our initiatives in direct sales and through referral and reseller sales channel relationships. The Network connectivity segment net growth increase is attributable to the increase in Network connectivity revenue from our inContact customers, exceeding lost revenue from attrition of our Network connectivity only customers. We expect the Network connectivity revenue from our inContact cloud software solutions customers to continue to exceed the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers in 2016. We expect Software and Network connectivity segment revenue to continue to increase during 2016.\nThere has been an increase in costs of revenue during 2015 due to increased direct costs attributable to fees we pay to network connectivity service providers, for third party licensed technology, greater professional service and customer service personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) as we employ more personnel, including higher-paid employees with more developed skill sets to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network infrastructure costs to build out and maintain our platform, amortization of acquired technology and an increase in amortization of previously capitalized internal use software costs. However, the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales has decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to the increase in Software segment revenue in general and an increase in Software segment revenue from our reseller sales channel relationships. We expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase as we incur additional costs for network connectivity service providers and licensed technology, continue investing in our network infrastructure and operation and support activities to maintain high availability and quality of service, but we expect the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales to remain the same or to continue to decrease as we anticipate increases in revenue related to realized economies of scale in network infrastructure, personnel and customer support.\nSources of Revenue\nOur revenue is reported and recognized based on the type of services provided to the customer as follows:\nSoftware Revenue. Software revenue includes two main sources of revenue:\n(1) Software delivery and support of our inContact cloud software solutions that are provided on a monthly subscription basis and associated professional services. Because our customers purchasing software and support services on a monthly recurring basis do not have the right to take possession of the software, we consider these arrangements to be service contracts and are not within the scope of Industry Topic 985, Software. We generally bill monthly recurring subscription charges in arrears and recognize these charges in the period in which they are earned. In addition to the monthly recurring revenue, revenue is also received on a non-recurring basis for professional services or on a recurring basis related to improving a customer's contact center efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to utilization of the inContact cloud software solutions.\nFor subscription service contracts with multiple elements (hosted software, training, installation and long distance services), we follow the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25, Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements. In addition to the monthly recurring subscription revenue, we also derive revenue on a non-recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer's inContact cloud software solutions experience. Because our professional services, such as training and implementation, are not considered to have standalone value, we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services in multiple element arrangements and recognize such fees as revenue over the estimated life of the customer. Fees for network connectivity services in multiple element arrangements within the inContact cloud software solutions are based on usage and we recognize revenue in the same manner as fees for telecommunication services discussed in the Network Connectivity Services Revenue\u201d below.\n(2) Perpetual product and services revenues are primarily derived from the sale of licenses to our WFO on-premise software products and services. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, revenue is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nMany of our customers purchase a combination of software, service, hardware, post contract customer support ( PCS\u201d) and hosting. PCS provided to our customers includes technical software support services and unspecified software upgrades to customers on a when-and-if available basis.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to customers who purchase our products for resale and is generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a sell-in\u201d basis). We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. If a reseller develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally accepted, we defer the revenue until the receipt of cash. Our arrangements with resellers are periodically reviewed as our business and products change.\nThrough the year ended December 31, 2014, software revenue also includes the quarterly minimum purchase commitments from a related party reseller referred to in Part VI, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d During 2015 no revenue was earned under this agreement, as it ended in 2014 and was not renewed.\nNetwork Connectivity Service Revenue. Network Connectivity Services revenue is derived from network connectivity, such as dedicated transport, switched long distance and data services. These services are provided over our network or through third party network connectivity providers. Our network is the backbone of our subscription software and allows us to provide the all-in-one inContact cloud contact center software solutions. Revenue for the network connectivity usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer's call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated. Customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period. If the billing period spans more than one month, earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date.\nFurther information about our revenue recognition policies are disclosed at Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 1 - Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCosts of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCosts of Revenue\nCosts of revenue consist primarily of payments to third party network connectivity service providers for resold network connectivity services to our customers and for third party technology licenses. Costs of revenue also include personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for professional services, customer support and network operations organizations and equipment depreciation and expenses relating to our network infrastructure, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs, and allocated overhead, such as rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment. As a result, overhead expenses are included in costs of revenue and each operating expense category. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers and for third party technology licenses, which vary depending on our customers' usage of our inContact cloud software solutions, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase as we incur additional costs for network connectivity service providers and for third party technology licenses, continue investing in our network infrastructure and operation and support activities to maintain high availability and quality of service. As our business grows, we expect to realize economies of scale in network infrastructure and personnel costs related to professional services, customer support and network operations organizations.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing, including commissions and bonuses, advertising, marketing events, corporate communications, expenses, travel costs and allocated overhead. Since our Software segment revenue is delivered and, therefore, recognized over time, we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. We believe it is important to continue investing in selling and marketing to create brand awareness and lead generation opportunities, to increase market share and to support our reseller channels. Accordingly, we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support growth initiatives, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of the non-capitalized portion of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products, enhancement of existing products, quality assurance, market research, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality on a frequent basis, expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses, professional service fees and other corporate expenses related to the growth of our business and operations in the future. As such, we expect general and administrative expenses fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nResults of Operations\nResults of 2015 versus 2014\nThe following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nRevenue: Total revenues increased $50.2 million or 29% to $222.0 million during 2015 compared to revenues of $171.8 million during 2014. The increase relates to an increase of $42.9 million in Software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing efforts of our inContact cloud contact center software solutions through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the addition of revenue generated from the sale of Uptivity products and services since the acquisition in May 2014. Network connectivity segment revenue increased $7.3 million as the increase of Network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeded the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments. We did not recognize any revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments during 2015, as the minimum purchase commitment expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions. The growth in Software revenue during the period more than offset the decrease in Unify minimum purchase commitment revenue.\nCosts of revenue and gross margin: Costs of revenue increased $19.8 million or 22% to $107.9 million during 2015 compared to $88.1 million during 2014. Our gross margin increased 2 percentage points to 51% during 2015 from 49% during 2014. The increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offset increased costs attributable to third party licensed technology, greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network operations personnel costs and expenses relating our continued investment in network infrastructure and operation and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. In addition, lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing related to a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs contributed to the increase of gross margin.\nSelling and marketing: Selling and marketing expense increased $15.2 million or 30% to $66.4 million during 2015 from $51.2 million during 2014. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions for direct and channel sales employees, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nResearch and development: Research and development expense increased $6.9 million or 31% to $29.3 million during 2015 compared to $22.4 million during 2014. The increase relates to our efforts to expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our product and service offerings and develop new technologies primarily through headcount additions, including the Uptivity acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense increased $5.9 million or 20% to $35.2 million during 2015 compared to $29.4 million during 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs and costs incurred to support our domestic and international business expansion. These increases were offset in part by decreases in acquisition costs and fees accrued for state sales taxes as we commenced collecting state sales taxes from our customers for applicable states in July 2015.\nOther expense: Other expense increased $5.0 million to $5.4 million during 2015 from $362,000 for 2014. The increase is primarily due to $5.2 million of interest related to the $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Notes we issued on March 30, 2015. See Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 7 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.\u201d\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes for 2015 was $529,000 compared to $9.1 million benefit for the same period in 2014. The income tax benefit in 2014 was due to recording a deferred tax liability upon acquisition of Uptivity related to a reduction of carrying value of deferred revenue and acquisition of intangibles for which no tax benefit will be derived. The reduction of carrying value and acquired intangibles resulted in a partial reversal of the valuation allowance upon consolidation.\nResults of 2014 versus 2013\nThe following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nRevenue: Total revenues increased $41.7 million or 32% to $171.8 million during 2014 compared to revenues of $130.0 million during 2013. The increase relates to an increase of $31.9 million in Software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing efforts of our inContact cloud contact center software solutions through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the $12.6 million of revenue generated from the sale of Uptivity software products and service since the acquisition in May 2014. Network connectivity segment revenue increased $9.8 million as the increase of Network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeded the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 and $6.8 million software revenue during 2013 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's 2014 and 2013 quarterly minimum purchase commitments. Under the arrangement, revenue from resold software services reduces Unify's obligation up to the amount of the quarterly minimum purchase commitments. These minimum purchase commitments were negotiated, in part to mitigate the risks associated with the investment in infrastructure to support our expanded reseller sales and marketing efforts and expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nCosts of revenue and gross margin: Costs of revenue increased $20.8 million or 31% to $88.1 million during 2014 compared to $67.4 million during 2013. Our gross margin increased one percentage point to 49% during 2014 from 48% during 2013. The increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offset increased costs attributable to greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. In addition, lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing related to a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs contributed to the increase of gross margin.\nSelling and marketing: Selling and marketing expense increased $14.0 million or 37% to $51.2 million during 2014 from $37.2 million during 2013. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions, including from the Uptivity acquisition, for direct and channel sales employees, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues and headcount and to a lesser extent, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nResearch and development: Research and development expense increased $9.8 million or 78% to $22.4 million during 2014 compared to $12.6 million during 2013. The increase relates to our efforts to expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our product and service offerings and develop new technologies primarily through headcount additions, including the Uptivity acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense increased $7.0 million or 32% to $29.4 million during 2014 compared to $22.3 million during 2013. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs and costs incurred to support our domestic and international business expansion, including Uptivity acquisition related costs.\nIncome taxes: Benefit (provision) for income taxes during 2014 was $9.1 million compared to ($373,000) for the same period in 2013. The income tax benefit during 2014 was due to recording a deferred tax liability upon acquisition of Uptivity related to a reduction of carrying value of deferred revenue and acquisition of intangibles for which no tax benefit will be derived. The reduction of carrying value and acquired intangibles resulted in a partial reversal of the valuation allowance upon consolidation.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate under two business segments: Software and Network connectivity. The Software segment includes all monthly recurring subscription revenue related to the delivery of our software solutions, revenue related to Uptivity products, associated professional services and setup fees, and revenue related to minimum purchase commitments from Unify through July 2014. The Network connectivity segment includes all voice and data long distance services provided to customers.\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on operating data (revenue, costs of revenue, and other operating expenses). Management does not evaluate and manage segment performance based on assets.\nFor segment reporting, we classify operating expenses as either direct\u201d or indirect.\u201d Direct expense refers to costs attributable solely to either selling and marketing efforts or research and development efforts. Indirect expense refers to costs that management considers to be overhead in running the business. Management evaluates expenditures for both selling and marketing and research and development efforts at the segment level without the allocation of overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment.\nSoftware Segment Results\nThe following is a tabular presentation and comparison of our Software segment condensed operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct selling and\nmarketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and\ndevelopment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Indirect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,682\n</td> <td> )\n</td>", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntroduction\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d) is provided as a supplement to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to help provide an understanding of inContact's financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.

We help contact centers around the world create effective customer experiences through our powerful cloud contact center contact routing, self-service and agent optimization software solutions. Our software solutions and services enable contact centers to operate more efficiently, optimize the cost and quality of every customer interaction, create new pathways to profit and ensure ongoing customer-centric business improvement and growth.\nWe began offering cloud software solutions to the contact center market in 2005. Our dynamic technology platform provides our customers a pay-as-you-go solution without the costs and complexities of premise-based systems. Our proven cloud delivery model provides compelling total cost of ownership savings over premise-based technology by reducing upfront capital expenditures, eliminating the expense of system management and maintenance fees, while providing agility that enables businesses to scale their technology as they grow.\nWe provide software which includes the following:\n \u25cf Automatic call distributing \n \u25cf Computer telephony integration \n \u25cf Interactive voice response with speech recognition \n \u25cf Outbound dialer \n \u25cf PBX and CRM integration \n \u25cf ECHO\u00ae agent service surveys and reports \n \u25cf Workforce optimization \n \u25cf Quality management \n \u25cf Screen recording \n \u25cf Interactive reporting tool \nTaken together, the inContact cloud software creates an integrated solution for contact centers, including those with distributed workforces-either at-home or multi-site.\nBusiness Developments\nIn March 2015, we issued $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) due April 1, 2022, unless earlier converted pursuant to their terms by the holders. Net proceeds from the Convertible Notes were approximately $111.2 million, net of transaction fees. The Convertible Notes pay interest in cash semiannually in arrears at a rate of 2.50% per annum.\nOn January 13, 2016, we acquired AC2 Solutions, Inc. AC2, a Delaware corporation, which provides call center workforce optimization products and services. On February 9, 2016, we acquired certain technology, customers and equipment from Attensity, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which provides call center analytics products and services. The combined purchase consideration was approximately $18.5 million cash and 40,456 restricted shares of the Company's common stock valued at $370,000 that will vest over two years. An additional 505,700 restricted shares of our common stock were issued, but not included in the purchase consideration as the shares will vest as services are provided over a two-year period.\nWe expect the majority of the purchase price of these acquisitions to be allocated to goodwill and acquired intangible assets as the valuation of certain assets and liabilities is ongoing as of the date of this Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business\nWe continue to experience increases in Software segment revenue principally due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing through our initiatives in direct sales and through referral and reseller sales channel relationships. The Network connectivity segment net growth increase is attributable to the increase in Network connectivity revenue from our inContact customers, exceeding lost revenue from attrition of our Network connectivity only customers. We expect the Network connectivity revenue from our inContact cloud software solutions customers to continue to exceed the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers in 2016. We expect Software and Network connectivity segment revenue to continue to increase during 2016.\nThere has been an increase in costs of revenue during 2015 due to increased direct costs attributable to fees we pay to network connectivity service providers, for third party licensed technology, greater professional service and customer service personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) as we employ more personnel, including higher-paid employees with more developed skill sets to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network infrastructure costs to build out and maintain our platform, amortization of acquired technology and an increase in amortization of previously capitalized internal use software costs. However, the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales has decreased in 2015 as compared to 2014 due to the increase in Software segment revenue in general and an increase in Software segment revenue from our reseller sales channel relationships. We expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase as we incur additional costs for network connectivity service providers and licensed technology, continue investing in our network infrastructure and operation and support activities to maintain high availability and quality of service, but we expect the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales to remain the same or to continue to decrease as we anticipate increases in revenue related to realized economies of scale in network infrastructure, personnel and customer support.\nSources of Revenue\nOur revenue is reported and recognized based on the type of services provided to the customer as follows:\nSoftware Revenue. Software revenue includes two main sources of revenue:\n(1) Software delivery and support of our inContact cloud software solutions that are provided on a monthly subscription basis and associated professional services. Because our customers purchasing software and support services on a monthly recurring basis do not have the right to take possession of the software, we consider these arrangements to be service contracts and are not within the scope of Industry Topic 985, Software. We generally bill monthly recurring subscription charges in arrears and recognize these charges in the period in which they are earned. In addition to the monthly recurring revenue, revenue is also received on a non-recurring basis for professional services or on a recurring basis related to improving a customer's contact center efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to utilization of the inContact cloud software solutions.\nFor subscription service contracts with multiple elements (hosted software, training, installation and long distance services), we follow the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 605-25, Revenue Recognition for Multiple Element Arrangements. In addition to the monthly recurring subscription revenue, we also derive revenue on a non-recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer's inContact cloud software solutions experience. Because our professional services, such as training and implementation, are not considered to have standalone value, we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services in multiple element arrangements and recognize such fees as revenue over the estimated life of the customer. Fees for network connectivity services in multiple element arrangements within the inContact cloud software solutions are based on usage and we recognize revenue in the same manner as fees for telecommunication services discussed in the Network Connectivity Services Revenue\u201d below.\n(2) Perpetual product and services revenues are primarily derived from the sale of licenses to our WFO on-premise software products and services. For software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software, revenue is recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met.\nMany of our customers purchase a combination of software, service, hardware, post contract customer support ( PCS\u201d) and hosting. PCS provided to our customers includes technical software support services and unspecified software upgrades to customers on a when-and-if available basis.\nProduct revenue derived from shipments to customers who purchase our products for resale and is generally recognized when such products are shipped (on a sell-in\u201d basis). We have historically experienced insignificant product returns from resellers, and our payment terms for these customers are similar to those granted to our end-users. If a reseller develops a pattern of payment delinquency, or seeks payment terms longer than generally accepted, we defer the revenue until the receipt of cash. Our arrangements with resellers are periodically reviewed as our business and products change.\nThrough the year ended December 31, 2014, software revenue also includes the quarterly minimum purchase commitments from a related party reseller referred to in Part VI, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d During 2015 no revenue was earned under this agreement, as it ended in 2014 and was not renewed.\nNetwork Connectivity Service Revenue. Network Connectivity Services revenue is derived from network connectivity, such as dedicated transport, switched long distance and data services. These services are provided over our network or through third party network connectivity providers. Our network is the backbone of our subscription software and allows us to provide the all-in-one inContact cloud contact center software solutions. Revenue for the network connectivity usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer's call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated. Customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period. If the billing period spans more than one month, earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date.\nFurther information about our revenue recognition policies are disclosed at Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 1 - Description of the Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCosts of Revenue and Operating Expenses\nCosts of Revenue\nCosts of revenue consist primarily of payments to third party network connectivity service providers for resold network connectivity services to our customers and for third party technology licenses. Costs of revenue also include personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for professional services, customer support and network operations organizations and equipment depreciation and expenses relating to our network infrastructure, amortization of acquired intangible assets, amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs, and allocated overhead, such as rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment. As a result, overhead expenses are included in costs of revenue and each operating expense category. Cost of revenue can fluctuate based on a number of factors, including the fees we pay to telecommunications providers and for third party technology licenses, which vary depending on our customers' usage of our inContact cloud software solutions, the timing of capital expenditures and related depreciation charges and changes in headcount. We expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase as we incur additional costs for network connectivity service providers and for third party technology licenses, continue investing in our network infrastructure and operation and support activities to maintain high availability and quality of service. As our business grows, we expect to realize economies of scale in network infrastructure and personnel costs related to professional services, customer support and network operations organizations.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing, including commissions and bonuses, advertising, marketing events, corporate communications, expenses, travel costs and allocated overhead. Since our Software segment revenue is delivered and, therefore, recognized over time, we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. We believe it is important to continue investing in selling and marketing to create brand awareness and lead generation opportunities, to increase market share and to support our reseller channels. Accordingly, we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support growth initiatives, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of the non-capitalized portion of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products, enhancement of existing products, quality assurance, market research, testing, product management and allocated overhead. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality on a frequent basis, expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including stock-based compensation) and related expenses for management, finance and accounting, legal, information systems and human resources personnel, professional fees, other corporate expenses and allocated overhead. We anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses, professional service fees and other corporate expenses related to the growth of our business and operations in the future. As such, we expect general and administrative expenses fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period, although these expenses as a percentage of our revenue are expected to decrease over time.\nResults of Operations\nResults of 2015 versus 2014\nThe following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 221,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,206\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,871\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,272\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,384\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,022\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,255\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,621\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (529\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,600\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,784\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,221\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue: Total revenues increased $50.2 million or 29% to $222.0 million during 2015 compared to revenues of $171.8 million during 2014. The increase relates to an increase of $42.9 million in Software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing efforts of our inContact cloud contact center software solutions through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the addition of revenue generated from the sale of Uptivity products and services since the acquisition in May 2014. Network connectivity segment revenue increased $7.3 million as the increase of Network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeded the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments. We did not recognize any revenue from Unify's minimum purchase commitments during 2015, as the minimum purchase commitment expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions. The growth in Software revenue during the period more than offset the decrease in Unify minimum purchase commitment revenue.\nCosts of revenue and gross margin: Costs of revenue increased $19.8 million or 22% to $107.9 million during 2015 compared to $88.1 million during 2014. Our gross margin increased 2 percentage points to 51% during 2015 from 49% during 2014. The increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offset increased costs attributable to third party licensed technology, greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers, increased network operations personnel costs and expenses relating our continued investment in network infrastructure and operation and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. In addition, lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing related to a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs contributed to the increase of gross margin.\nSelling and marketing: Selling and marketing expense increased $15.2 million or 30% to $66.4 million during 2015 from $51.2 million during 2014. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions for direct and channel sales employees, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nResearch and development: Research and development expense increased $6.9 million or 31% to $29.3 million during 2015 compared to $22.4 million during 2014. The increase relates to our efforts to expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our product and service offerings and develop new technologies primarily through headcount additions, including the Uptivity acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense increased $5.9 million or 20% to $35.2 million during 2015 compared to $29.4 million during 2014. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs and costs incurred to support our domestic and international business expansion. These increases were offset in part by decreases in acquisition costs and fees accrued for state sales taxes as we commenced collecting state sales taxes from our customers for applicable states in July 2015.\nOther expense: Other expense increased $5.0 million to $5.4 million during 2015 from $362,000 for 2014. The increase is primarily due to $5.2 million of interest related to the $115.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Notes we issued on March 30, 2015. See Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 7 - Long-Term Debt and Capital Lease Obligations.\u201d\nIncome taxes: The provision for income taxes for 2015 was $529,000 compared to $9.1 million benefit for the same period in 2014. The income tax benefit in 2014 was due to recording a deferred tax liability upon acquisition of Uptivity related to a reduction of carrying value of deferred revenue and acquisition of intangibles for which no tax benefit will be derived. The reduction of carrying value and acquired intangibles resulted in a partial reversal of the valuation allowance upon consolidation.\nResults of 2014 versus 2013\nThe following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 130,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,272\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,479\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,793\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (362\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (351\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,830\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,804\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (373\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,563\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10,203\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (360\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue: Total revenues increased $41.7 million or 32% to $171.8 million during 2014 compared to revenues of $130.0 million during 2013. The increase relates to an increase of $31.9 million in Software segment revenue due to our continued focus and investment in sales and marketing efforts of our inContact cloud contact center software solutions through our direct sales and referral and reseller partner arrangements. The increase is also the result of the $12.6 million of revenue generated from the sale of Uptivity software products and service since the acquisition in May 2014. Network connectivity segment revenue increased $9.8 million as the increase of Network connectivity revenue associated with our inContact cloud software solution customers exceeded the attrition of our Network connectivity only customers.\nWe recognized $3.6 million of software revenue during 2014 and $6.8 million software revenue during 2013 under our reseller agreement with Unify, which principally represents revenue from Unify's 2014 and 2013 quarterly minimum purchase commitments. Under the arrangement, revenue from resold software services reduces Unify's obligation up to the amount of the quarterly minimum purchase commitments. These minimum purchase commitments were negotiated, in part to mitigate the risks associated with the investment in infrastructure to support our expanded reseller sales and marketing efforts and expired in the third quarter of 2014. See additional information about the Unify relationship in Part IV, Item 15 Financial Statements\u201d - Note 13 - Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nCosts of revenue and gross margin: Costs of revenue increased $20.8 million or 31% to $88.1 million during 2014 compared to $67.4 million during 2013. Our gross margin increased one percentage point to 49% during 2014 from 48% during 2013. The increase in revenue from our inContact cloud contact center solutions offset increased costs attributable to greater professional service personnel costs incurred to service larger mid-market and enterprise customers and increased amortization of intangible assets from business acquisitions. In addition, lower network connectivity costs due to increased efficiencies in call routing related to a continued investment in technology and lower negotiated direct costs contributed to the increase of gross margin.\nSelling and marketing: Selling and marketing expense increased $14.0 million or 37% to $51.2 million during 2014 from $37.2 million during 2013. This increase is primarily a result of headcount additions, including from the Uptivity acquisition, for direct and channel sales employees, increased commissions as a result of increased revenues and headcount and to a lesser extent, higher levels of investment in marketing efforts to create increased awareness of our products and services as well as increased lead generation efforts for our Software segment.\nResearch and development: Research and development expense increased $9.8 million or 78% to $22.4 million during 2014 compared to $12.6 million during 2013. The increase relates to our efforts to expand our content offerings, upgrade and extend our product and service offerings and develop new technologies primarily through headcount additions, including the Uptivity acquisition.\nGeneral and administrative: General and administrative expense increased $7.0 million or 32% to $29.4 million during 2014 compared to $22.3 million during 2013. The increase is primarily due to increased personnel costs and costs incurred to support our domestic and international business expansion, including Uptivity acquisition related costs.\nIncome taxes: Benefit (provision) for income taxes during 2014 was $9.1 million compared to ($373,000) for the same period in 2013. The income tax benefit during 2014 was due to recording a deferred tax liability upon acquisition of Uptivity related to a reduction of carrying value of deferred revenue and acquisition of intangibles for which no tax benefit will be derived. The reduction of carrying value and acquired intangibles resulted in a partial reversal of the valuation allowance upon consolidation.\nSegment Reporting\nWe operate under two business segments: Software and Network connectivity. The Software segment includes all monthly recurring subscription revenue related to the delivery of our software solutions, revenue related to Uptivity products, associated professional services and setup fees, and revenue related to minimum purchase commitments from Unify through July 2014. The Network connectivity segment includes all voice and data long distance services provided to customers.\nManagement evaluates segment performance based on operating data (revenue, costs of revenue, and other operating expenses). Management does not evaluate and manage segment performance based on assets.\nFor segment reporting, we classify operating expenses as either direct\u201d or indirect.\u201d Direct expense refers to costs attributable solely to either selling and marketing efforts or research and development efforts. Indirect expense refers to costs that management considers to be overhead in running the business. Management evaluates expenditures for both selling and marketing and research and development efforts at the segment level without the allocation of overhead expenses, such as rent, utilities and depreciation on property and equipment.\nSoftware Segment Results\nThe following is a tabular presentation and comparison of our Software segment condensed operating results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 vs. 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct selling and\nmarketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,722\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct research and\ndevelopment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Indirect\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (38,682\n</td> <td> )\n</td>"}
