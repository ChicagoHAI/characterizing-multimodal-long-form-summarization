The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion and analysis, the term net income refers to net income attributable to NCM, Inc.\nOverview\nWe are America's Movie Network. As the #1 weekend network for Millennials (age 18-34) in the U.S., we are the connector between brands and movie audiences. We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses in FirstLook, our cinema advertising and entertainment pre-show seen on movie screens across the U.S. We also sell advertising on our LEN, a series of strategically-placed screens located in movie theater lobbies, as well as other forms of advertising and promotions in theater lobbies. In addition, we sell online and mobile advertising through our Cinema Accelerator digital product to reach entertainment audiences beyond the theater. We have long-term ESAs (over 20 years remaining as of December 29, 2016) and multi-year agreements with network affiliates, which expire at various dates between July 14, 2017 and July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 18.1 years as of December 29, 2016. The ESAs and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theaters to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theater attendance is generated by theaters connected to our DCN (the remaining screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors).\nManagement focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings at least once per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed in Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d above, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local advertising pricing (CPM), local and regional advertising rate per screen per week, local and regional and total advertising revenue per attendee. We also monitor free cash flow, the dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA), cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Transactions\nOn May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) to merge with Screenvision. On November 3, 2014, the DOJ filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger. On March 16, 2015, NCM, Inc. announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members. On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million\nincurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the year ended December 31, 2015). NCM, Inc. and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred.\nOur operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nSummary Historical and Operating Data\nYou should read this information in conjunction with the other information contained in this document, and our audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nThe following table presents operating data and Adjusted OIBDA (dollars in millions, except share and margin data).

In connection with the offering, NCM, Inc. purchased newly issued common membership units from NCM LLC and common membership units from NCM LLC's founding members, and became a member of and the sole manager of NCM LLC. We entered into several agreements to effect the reorganization and the financing transaction and certain amendments were made to the existing ESAs to govern the relationships among NCM LLC and NCM LLC's founding members after the completion of these transactions.\nThe results of operations data discussed herein were derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting records of NCM, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto.\nWe have a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNational advertising revenue. The $4.9 million, or 1.6%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from the founding members) was due primarily to a 9.6% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 29, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and a $5.4 million increase in online, mobile and other revenue not included in the inventory measured by impressions sold or by CPMs. The increase in national advertising CPMs was due primarily to higher CPMs on upfront commitments year over year and to a lesser extent higher CPMs in the scatter market as well. These increases to revenue were partially offset by an 8.2% decrease in impressions sold during the year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in impressions sold was due primarily to fewer impressions sold during the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in impressions sold resulted in a decrease in national inventory utilization, from 128.3% in 2015 to 118.4% in 2016 on a 0.8% decrease in network attendance. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our FirstLook pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $2.5 million, or 2.3%, decrease in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by a decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000, whereby they had a 6.9% decrease in contract volume and a 5.6% decrease in average contract value during 2016, compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000 was driven by fewer contracts that were greater than $1 million. This was\npartially offset by revenue from contracts less than $100,000 which increased 2.5% in contract volume primarily related to the expansion of our salesforce and diversification of our client base.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $1.3 million, or 4.3%, decrease in national advertising revenue from the founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a decrease of $3.0 million related to one of the founding members reducing the length of its beverage advertising unit by 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in beverage revenue CPMs. The 2016 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2014 to 2015, which increased 5.7%.\nOperating expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $23.9 million, or 8.0%, from $298.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $274.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2016.

Advertising operating costs decreased $0.8 million, or 2.6%, from $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.4 million decrease in personnel related expenses and $0.2 million lower on-screen production costs during year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.7 million, or 3.9%, from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $17.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2016 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in network maintenance costs related to our DCN.\nTheater access fees-founding members. Theater access fees increased $2.6 million, or 3.6%, from $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $75.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase was due to a $2.6 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. The $2.6 million increase in digital screen fees increased $1.5 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $1.1 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with higher quality digital cinema equipment. Theater access fees based upon founding member attendance remained consistent during 2016, compared to 2015 as founding member attendance remained flat year over year.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $0.5 million, or 0.7%, from $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $72.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in online publisher expense related to higher online and mobile revenue, a $0.8 million increase in marketing research expenses and $0.7 million due to a non-cash impairment charge on an investment obtained in exchange for advertising services. These increases to selling and marketing costs were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower commission and bonus expense during the year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $5.2 million, or 13.5%, from $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $43.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016 due primarily to a $3.0 million increase in CEO transition costs, which consisted primarily of severance and consulting costs to our former CEO, a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related costs related primarily to higher non-cash share based compensation expense associated with modifying equity awards with our former CEO, a $0.7 million increase in franchise and other non-income based tax expenses and a $0.6 million increase in professional service costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.6 million, or 11.2%, from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $35.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related primarily to founding member common unit adjustments, partially offset by lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. The merger termination fee and related merger costs were $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and approximately $7.5 million in primarily legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses increased $10.3 million, or 15.5%, from $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $76.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016.

The loss on early retirement of debt included an approximate $7.9 million redemption premium and the write-off of approximately $2.5 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. The interest on borrowings increased approximately $1.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the one-month period between the issuance of the Notes due 2026 in August 2016 and the redemption of the Notes due 2021 in September 2016, whereby interest was paid on both notes for one month, as well as, a higher LIBOR rate on our term loans during 2016 compared to 2015. These increases in non-operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the amortization of terminated derivatives as the amortization period ended in February 2015.\nNet income. Net income increased $10.0 million from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase of $25.0 million in operating income, as described above, and a decrease of $8.6 million in income tax expense due primarily to a change of $7.8 million for a reserve for uncertain tax positions as $4.9 million of reserve was added during 2015 and $2.9 million was reversed during 2016 as the statute of limitations expired in the period. These increases to net income were partially offset by an increase of $10.3 million in non-operating expense, as described above, and a $13.3 million increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nRevenue. Total revenue increased $52.5 million, or 13.3%, from $394.0 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $446.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNational advertising revenue. The $51.1 million, or 20.0%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from the founding members) was due primarily to a 14.2% increase in impressions sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 and a 6.7% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase in impressions sold was driven by an increase in national inventory utilization from 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015 to 128.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an expansion of our client base and increased spending by certain existing clients, related in part to the success of our strategy to compete in the national television Upfront marketplace. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our FirstLook pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate. This increase in impressions sold was also driven by an increase in our network theater attendance of 0.9% related to an overall increase in cinema industry attendance resulting from a stronger film release schedule and the addition of new network screens. The increase in CPMs relates primarily to our successful Upfront sales campaign and strong scatter market.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $9.8 million, or 9.8%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase of $6.9 million, or 21.7%, in revenue from larger regional contracts (greater than $100,000). The volume of contracts greater than $100,000 increased 33.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 9.1% in average contract value of contracts greater than $100,000. The increase in volume of contracts greater than $100,000 was due to the stronger film release schedule and higher sales to agencies responsible for larger regional advertising budgets. Revenue from local contracts under $100,000 increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $8.4 million, or 21.9%, decrease in national advertising revenue from the founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a 14.4% decrease in beverage revenue CPMs and a decrease of 0.4% in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The 2015 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2013 to 2014, which decreased 14.4%. Founding member beverage revenue also decreased by $2.7 million due to one of the founding members reducing the length of the beverage advertising unit from 60 seconds to 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015. We have the right to sell the 30 second unit to other clients.\nOperating expenses. Total operating expenses increased $56.2 million, or 23.2%, from $242.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $298.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Advertising operating costs increased $4.4 million, or 16.7%, from $26.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of a $3.6 million increase in affiliate advertising payments which was driven by higher national and local advertising revenue and a 3.5% increase in the number of average affiliate screens for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.5 million, or 2.7%, from $18.3 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower salaries due to department realignment, partially offset by higher bonus expense due to improved performance against targets compared to 2014.\nTheater access fees-founding members. Theater access fees increased $1.9 million, or 2.7%, from $70.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was due to a $2.0 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. These fees increased $1.3 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $0.7 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with the higher quality digital cinema equipment. This increase of $2.0 million was partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in attendance related fees due to a 0.4% decrease in founding member attendance during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $14.7 million, or 25.5%, from $57.6 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $8.5 million in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense, higher commission expense and higher bonus expense, all primarily related to better performance against targets and higher revenue compared to 2014. Selling and marketing costs also increased due to an increase of $2.1 million in bad debt expense due to a smaller reserve in 2014 compared to 2015 and an increase of $1.2 million in non-cash barter expense.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $9.1 million, or 30.8%, from $29.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to a $7.7 million increase in personnel related expenses due primarily to higher non-cash share-based compensation expense and higher bonus expense, both primarily related to better performance against targets compared to 2014, as well as, an increase in salaries and related payroll tax and benefit costs. Administrative and other costs also increased due to approximately $0.8 million in higher legal and professional expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from $32.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related to new affiliate agreements and the founding member common unit adjustments.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. Merger-related costs increased by $26.8 million from $7.5 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses decreased $9.7 million, or 12.7%, from $76.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table shows the changes in non-operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 (in millions):\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion of interest on the discounted payable to\nfounding members under tax receivable agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of terminated derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-operating expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in non-operating expense was due primarily to an $8.4 million decrease in the amortization of terminated derivatives as the amortization period ended in February 2015, a decrease of $0.6 million in other non-operating expense and a decrease of $0.5 million in accretion of interest expense under the tax receivable agreement due primarily to changes in tax rates and NCM LLC ownership rates period over period.\nNet income. Net income increased $2.0 million from $13.4 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net income was primarily due to a decrease of $9.7 million in non-operating expense, as described above and a $3.9 million decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by a decrease in operating income of $3.7 million, as described further above, and an increase in income tax expense of $7.9 million due primarily to a $4.9 million tax reserve for uncertain tax positions and higher net income before taxes in the period.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nTrends and Uncertainties Related to our Business, Industry and Corporate Structure\nChanges in the current macro-economic environment and changes in the national, regional and local advertising markets, present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations, including the timing and amount of spending from our advertising clients. These changes include increased competition related to the expansion of online and mobile advertising platforms. Further, we could negatively be impacted by factors that could reduce the viewership of our FirstLook pre-show, such as the expansion of reserve seating, an increase in the number and length of trailers for upcoming films and lower network attendance, which could result from shortening of release windows, more alternative methods of delivering movies to consumers, lower consumer confidence and disposable income and a decline in the motion picture box office. The impact to our business associated with these issues could be mitigated over time due to factors including the increase in salable advertising impressions, better geographic coverage related to the expansion of our network, diversification and growth of our advertising client base, improvements in FirstLook pre-show engagement ad upgrades to our inventory management and data management systems. We could also benefit if the effectiveness of cinema advertising improves relative to other advertising mediums. We continue to participate in the Upfronts and believe that over time, a shift toward more upfront commitments, would allow us to bundle several client flights throughout the year in an effort to stabilize month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter volatility. Consistent with the television industry upfront booking practices, a portion of our upfront commitments have cancellation options or options to reduce the amount that advertisers may purchase and we would need to rely on the scatter market to replace those commitments.\nThe net screens added to our network by the founding members and network affiliates during the year ended December 29, 2016 were as follows.\nTable 146: <table></table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of screens\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Founding Members\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Network Affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New affiliates (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Openings, net of closures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Balance as of December 29, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> During the year ended December 29, 2016, we added three net new affiliates with 232 screens, partially offset by the loss of a theater circuit that was acquired by a circuit not in our network, resulting in 194 screens being removed from our network.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that adding screens and attendees to our network will provide our advertising clients with a better marketing product with increased reach and improved geographic coverage. We have begun to offer our advertising clients better audience targeting capabilities and more robust campaign data analytics that are expected to assist with our strategy to provide a better product offering to advertisers and thus expand our overall national client base. We also believe that the continued growth of our market coverage ubiquity and overall number of impressions will strengthen our selling proposition and competitive positioning against other national, regional and local video advertising platforms, including television, online and mobile video platforms and other out of home video advertising platforms.\nIn 2014, we experienced a decline of 16.4%, in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue) compared to the prior year due primarily to the increased competition from other national video networks, including online and mobile advertising platforms, television networks and other out-of-home video networks and the implementation of more aggressive seasonal and volume pricing strategies that contributed to the expansion of our inventory utilization related to the addition of new client categories that traditionally buy their television advertising at lower CPMs. After adjusting our pricing through 2014 to be more attractive to a broader number of potential clients, to compete more effectively with various forms of premium video advertising and reflect seasonal marketplace supply and demand characteristics, during 2015 and 2016, we experienced an increase of 6.7% and 9.6%, respectively, in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage revenue). We experience even more substantial volatility quarter-to-quarter. This volatility in utilization can be driven by the loss or addition of one or more significant national contracts, whereby the timing and amount of these national contracts can be based upon the advertising budgets of our customers, product launches, the financial performance of our customers or other industry or macro-economic factors. We expect our CPMs and utilization to continue to be impacted period to period based upon the factors described above.\nUnder the ESAs, up to 90 seconds of the FirstLook program can be sold to NCM LLC's founding members to satisfy their on-screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements. During the first six months of 2015, we sold 60 seconds to NCM LLC's founding members. Beginning July 1, 2015, one of our founding members reduced their beverage advertising from 60 seconds to 30 seconds. We have the right to sell the 30 second unit to other clients. The other founding members' current long-term contracts with their beverage suppliers require 60 seconds of beverage advertising, although such commitments could change in the future. Should the amount of time acquired as part of these beverage concessionaire agreements decline with the other founding members, this premium time will be available for sale to other clients. Per the ESAs, the time sold to the founding member beverage supplier is priced equal to the advertising CPM for the previous year charged to unaffiliated third parties during segment one (closest to show time) of the FirstLook pre-show, limited to the highest advertising CPM being then-charged by NCM LLC, which in 2016 increased 10.2%. Thus, the CPM on our beverage concessionaire revenue in 2017 will increase by 10.2%, compared to 2016.\nIn consideration for NCM LLC's access to NCM LLC's founding members' theater attendees for on-screen advertising and use of lobbies and other space within NCM LLC's founding members' theaters for the LEN and lobby promotions, NCM LLC's founding members receive a monthly theater access fee under the ESAs. The theater access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron and a fixed payment per digital screen (connected to the DCN). The payment per theater patron increases by 8% every five years, with the next increase taking effect for fiscal year 2017, and the payment per digital screen increases annually by 5%. The theater access fee paid in the aggregate to all founding members cannot be less than 12% of NCM LLC's aggregate advertising revenue (as defined in the ESA), or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment. Pursuant to ESAs, the theater access fee paid to the members of NCM LLC included an additional fee for access to the higher quality digital cinema systems. This additional fee will continue to increase as additional screens are equipped with the new digital cinema equipment and the fee increases annually by 5%. As of December 29, 2016, 90% of our founding member network screens were showing advertising on digital cinema projectors.\nTrends and Uncertainties Related to Liquidity and Financial Performance\nDuring the past several years, we amended our senior secured credit facility to extend the maturity, expand the revolver availability and reduce the interest rate spreads. In August 2016, we completed a private placement of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due in 2026. A portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our $200.0 million 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2021. The remaining proceeds, after the payment of fees and the redemption premium were used to pay down the balance on our revolving credit facility. As a result of these financing transactions on our revolving credit facility and senior notes, we extended the average maturities of our debt and as of December 29, 2016, the average remaining maturity of our debt is 5.7 years. As of December 29, 2016, approximately 70% of our outstanding borrowings bear interest at fixed rates. The remaining 30% of our outstanding borrowings bear interest at variable rates and as such, our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate with interest rate fluctuations related to our borrowings. Refer to Note 9 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nAt times our cash flow available for the payment of dividends (NCM LLC's Adjusted OIBDA, less capital expenditures, interest expense, distributions to NCM LLC's founding members, income taxes, tax receivable agreement payments to NCM LLC's founding members and plus certain cash items) has been less than our regular dividend payment. Any deficit has been funded by NCM, Inc.'s cash and marketable securities balances. As of December 29, 2016, these cash and marketable securities balances totaled $58.0 million (excluding NCM LLC). We intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future at the discretion of the Board of Directors consistent with our intention to distribute over time a substantial portion of our free cash flow. The declaration, payment, timing and amount of any future dividends payable will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors who will take into account general economic and advertising market business conditions, the Company's financial condition, available cash, current and anticipated cash needs, and any other factors that the Board of Directors considers relevant.\nOur effective tax rate for the years ended December 29, 2016, December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 was 26.6%, 53.6% and 43.3%, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items and the relative amount of income that NCM, Inc. earns in various state and local jurisdictions. Our tax rate is also impacted by discrete items that may occur in any year. The decrease in the tax rate for the year ended December 29, 2016 was due to a reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions because the statute of limitations expired during the period. The increase in the tax rate of 10.3% between January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2015 is primarily the result of the establishment of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $4.9 million. Due to the expiration of the statute of limitations, $2.9 million of that amount was reversed in 2016, contributing to a decrease in the rate of 27.0% during the period. As of December 29, 2016, we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27.6 million and $47.5 million, respectively, which we expect to be able to utilize prior to their expiration. Refer to Note 6 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nTrends Related to Ownership in NCM LLC\nIn accordance with NCM LLC's Common Unit Adjustment Agreement with its founding members, on an annual basis NCM LLC determines the amount of common membership units to be issued to or returned by the founding members based on theater additions or dispositions during the previous year. During the first quarter of 2016, NCM LLC issued 1,416,515 common membership units to its founding members for the rights to exclusive access to the theater screens and attendees added, net of dispositions by the founding members to NCM LLC's network during 2015. NCM LLC recorded a net intangible asset of $21.1 million during the first quarter of 2016 as a result of the Common Unit Adjustment.\nOverall, NCM Inc.'s ownership in NCM LLC decreased to 43.7% as of December 29, 2016 compared to 43.8% at December 31, 2015 due to the common unit adjustments described above, partially offset by the issuance of NCM, Inc. common stock upon the vesting of restricted stock or exercise of stock options, which has proportionally increased net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and decreased net income attributable to NCM, Inc.\nIn December 2016, AMC completed its acquisition of a large motion picture exhibitor, Carmike Cinemas, Inc. ( Carmike\u201d). Following the acquisition, AMC retained Carmike's ownership in another cinema advertising provider (Screenvision) and the long-term agreement with that provider to provide cinema advertising remains in effect. In connection with the acquisition, AMC and the DOJ entered into a settlement regarding certain actions that AMC must take in order to complete the acquisition. Among those, AMC is required to divest the majority of its equity interests in NCM LLC, so that by June 20, 2019 it owns no more than 4.99% of NCM LLC's outstanding membership units. AMC must complete the divestiture per the following schedule: (i) on or before December 20, 2017, AMC must own no more than 15% of NCM LLC's outstanding membership units, (ii) on or before December 20, 2018, AMC must own no more than 7.5% of NCM LLC's outstanding membership units and (iii) on or before June 20, 2019, AMC must own no more than 4.99% of NCM LLC's outstanding membership units. As required by the DOJ settlement, AMC also relinquished its governance rights in NCM LLC, including its seats on the NCM, Inc. Board of Directors as well as its rights to nominate any person to serve on the NCM, Inc. Board of Directors. As of December 29, 2016, AMC's non-independent designee to the Board of Directors had resigned. Further, AMC is required to change the pre-show advertising provider for 24 identified theaters comprising 384 screens from NCM LLC to Screenvision or sell those theaters to a non-NCM network buyer. Seven of those 24 theaters either did not have a cinema advertising provider, they were already being sold by AMC or it was an encumbered theater that we were receiving integration payments for, such that 17 of the 24 theaters currently need to be transferred or sold. AMC is also required to divest 15 AMC or Carmike theaters covering 15 local markets. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware which of those 15 theaters will be in our network or if they would be sold to another founding member or network affiliate. These theater transfers or sales represent approximately 2% of our total network of theaters as of December 29, 2016.\nPursuant to NCM, Inc.'s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and NCM LLC's Third Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement, as amended, members of NCM LLC, other than NCM, Inc., may choose to have common membership units redeemed, and NCM, Inc. may elect to redeem through either a cash payment or the issuance of shares of its common stock on a one-for-one basis. If AMC redeems its common membership units for NCM, Inc. common stock, NCM, Inc.'s ownership will increase proportionally and the number of shares outstanding of NCM, Inc. common stock will increase. Further, the sale of AMC theaters or transfer of advertising on those theaters, may require AMC to transfer and surrender, and NCM LLC to cancel, common membership units related to the theater dispositions.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nLiquidity\nOur cash balances can fluctuate due to the seasonality of our business and related timing of collections of accounts receivable balances and operating expenditure payments, as well as, available cash payments (as defined in the NCM LLC Operating Agreement) to the founding members, interest or principal payments on our term loan and the Notes due 2022 and Notes due 2026, income tax payments, tax receivable agreement payments to the founding members and amount of quarterly dividends to NCM, Inc.'s common stockholders.\nA summary of our financial liquidity is as follows (in millions):\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 68.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolver availability (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 158.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total liquidity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 193.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (39.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Included in cash and cash equivalents as of December 29, 2016, December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 there was $10.7 million, $3.0 million and $10.2 million, respectively, of cash held by NCM LLC which is not available to satisfy NCM, Inc.'s dividend payments and other NCM, Inc. obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The revolving credit facility portion of NCM LLC's total borrowings is available, subject to certain conditions, for general corporate purposes of NCM LLC in the ordinary course of business and for other transactions permitted under the senior secured credit facility, and a portion is available for letters of credit.

The $28.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 29, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to a $23.3 million increase in consolidated net income, as described further above, and an increase in the change in accounts receivable of $22.0 million related to higher collections, partially offset by a $11.9 million decrease in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses due primarily to lower accrued bonus expense.\nInvesting Activities. The $5.7 million decrease in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 29, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to lower proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities, net of purchases, of approximately $4.4 million and $1.4 million lower proceeds from notes receivable due to timing of the payments.\nFinancing Activities. The $49.5 million increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 29, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was due primarily to higher repayments, net of proceeds, under our revolving credit facility of $95.0 million, partially offset by $42.1 million of proceeds from the issuance of the Notes due 2026, net of the redemption of the Notes due 2021.\nCash Flows - Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nOperating Activities. The $12.7 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in the change in accounts receivable primarily due to higher revenue and timing of collections in the period. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable and accrued expenses due primarily to higher accrued bonus expense.\nInvesting Activities. The $4.9 million increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 was due primarily to higher proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities, net of purchases, of approximately $8.5 million, partially offset by $3.9 million of higher purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2015.\nFinancing Activities. The $67.4 million decrease in cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 was due primarily to $42.0 million greater proceeds from borrowings, net of repayments, due to higher borrowings on the revolving credit facility to pay the merger termination fee and related merger costs, as described above, and a decrease of approximately $28.7 million in cash dividends paid due primarily to the payment of an special cash dividend in 2014 that did not occur in 2015. These decreases to cash used in financing activities were partially offset by a $5.2 million decrease in distributions to the founding members.\nSources of Capital and Capital Requirements\nNCM, Inc.'s primary source of liquidity and capital resources is the quarterly available cash distributions from NCM LLC as well as its existing cash balances and marketable securities, which as of December 29, 2016 were $58.0 million (excluding NCM LLC). NCM LLC's primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are its cash provided by operating activities, availability under its revolving credit facility and cash on hand. Refer to Note 9 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document and Financings\u201d below for a detailed discussion of the debt transactions in 2015 and 2016.\nManagement believes that future funds generated from NCM LLC's operations and cash on hand should be sufficient to fund working capital requirements, NCM LLC's debt service requirements, and capital expenditure and other investing requirements, through the next twelve months. Cash flows generated by NCM LLC's distributions to NCM, Inc. and the founding members can be impacted by the seasonality of advertising sales, stock option exercises, interest on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and to a lesser extent theater attendance. NCM LLC is required pursuant to the terms of the NCM LLC Operating Agreement to distribute its available cash, as defined in the operating agreement, quarterly to its\nmembers (the founding members and NCM, Inc.). The available cash distribution to the members of NCM LLC for the year ended December 29, 2016, net of the negative available cash generated in the first quarter of 2015 and netted against the second quarter of 2016 distribution, was approximately $132.6 million, of which approximately $57.5 million was distributed to NCM, Inc. NCM, Inc. expects to use cash received from future available cash distributions and its cash balances to fund payments associated with the tax receivable agreement with the founding members and current and future dividends as declared by the Board of Directors, including a dividend declared on January 19, 2017 of $0.22 per share (approximately $13.3 million) on each share of the Company's common stock (not including outstanding restricted stock) to stockholders of record on March 9, 2017 to be paid on March 23, 2017. Distributions from NCM LLC and NCM, Inc. cash balances should be sufficient to fund payments associated with the tax receivable agreement with the founding members, income taxes and its regular dividend for the foreseeable future at the discretion of the Board of Directors dependent on anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, future prospects for earnings, available cash and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures of NCM LLC have typically been capitalized software development or upgrades for our DCS and advertising proposal and inventory management and audience targeting and data management systems being developed primarily by our programmers and outside consultants, equipment required for our NOC and content production and post-production facilities, office leasehold improvements, desktop equipment for use by our employees, and in certain cases, the costs necessary to digitize all or a portion of a network affiliate's theaters when they are added to our network. Capital expenditures for the year ended December 29, 2016 were $13.3 million (including $1.1 million associated with network affiliate additions) compared to $13.0 million (including $1.1 million associated with network affiliate additions) for the 2015 period. The capital expenditures have typically been satisfied through cash flow from operations. All capital expenditures related to the DCN within the founding members' theaters have been made by the founding members under the ESAs. We expect they will continue to be made by the founding members in accordance with the ESAs.\nWe expect to make approximately $15.0 million to $16.0 million of capital expenditures in fiscal 2017, primarily for upgrades to our DCS distribution and content management software and our other internal management systems, including our proposal, inventory and audience targeting and data management systems, reporting systems, network equipment related to currently contracted network affiliate theaters, server and storage upgrades and software licensing. We expect these upgrades and improvements to our management reporting systems, which are intended to provide additional advertising scheduling and placement flexibility for our clients, should enhance our operating efficiencies, including allowing us to better manage our advertising inventory, create more targeted buys and provide more robust campaign data for our advertising clients to help drive future growth. Our capital expenditures will increase as we add additional network affiliates to our network. We expect that additional expenditures, if any, would be funded in part by additional cash flows associated with those new network affiliates. The commitments associated with our operating lease requirements are included in Contractual and Other Obligations\u201d below.\nFinancings\nAs of December 29, 2016, NCM LLC's senior secured credit facility consisted of a $175.0 million revolving credit facility and a $270.0 million term loan. On May 26, 2016, NCM LLC entered into an incremental amendment of its senior secured credit facility whereby the revolving credit facility was increased by $40.0 million to $175.0 million. On June 18, 2014, NCM LLC entered into an incremental amendment of its senior secured credit facility whereby the revolving credit facility was increased by $25.0 million to $135.0 million. In addition, on July 2, 2014, NCM LLC entered into an amendment of its senior secured credit facility whereby the maturity date was extended by two years to November 26, 2019, which corresponds to the maturity date of the $270 million term loans.\nOn August 19, 2016, NCM LLC completed a private placement of $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes. On September 19, 2016, NCM LLC redeemed its $200.0 million 7.875% Senior Unsecured Notes at a redemption price of 103.938% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. On April 27, 2012, NCM LLC completed a private placement of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.00% Senior Secured Notes for which the registered exchange offering was completed on November 26, 2012. For further information, refer to Note 9 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements located elsewhere in this document.\nThe senior secured credit facility contains a number of covenants and financial ratio requirements, with which NCM LLC was in compliance at December 29, 2016, including a consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as of December 29, 2016 of 3.0 versus a covenant of 6.5 times for each quarterly period. NCM LLC is permitted to make quarterly dividend payments and other payments based on leverage ratios for NCM LLC and its subsidiary so long as no default or event of\ndefault has occurred and continues to occur. The quarterly dividend payments and other distributions are made if the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is less than or equal to 6.5 times.\nThere are no borrower distribution restrictions as long as NCM LLC's consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio is below 6.5 times and NCM LLC is in compliance with its debt covenants. If there are limitations on the restricted payments, NCM LLC may not declare or pay any dividends, make any payments on account of NCM LLC, set aside assets for the retirement or other acquisition of capital stock of the borrower or any subsidiary, or make any other distribution for obligations of NCM LLC. When these restrictions are effective, NCM LLC may still pay the services fee and reimbursable costs pursuant to terms of the management agreement. NCM LLC can also make payments pursuant to the tax receivable agreement in the amount, and at the time necessary to satisfy the contractual obligations with respect to the actual cash tax benefits payable to NCM LLC's founding members.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe significant accounting policies of the Company are described in Note 1 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments, assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, which management considers critical accounting policies. The judgments, assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience, knowledge of the accounts and other factors, which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis. Because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management, actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates, which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the Company.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nNature of Estimates Required. The allowance for doubtful accounts represents management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables, which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet. Estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience, consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor-specific factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. Account receivable balances are charged against the allowance, while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance. A provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management's periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as, other pertinent factors. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods.\nSensitivity Analysis. As of December 29, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $6.3 million, or 3.8% of the gross accounts receivable balance. A 10% difference in the allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 29, 2016 would have affected net income attributable to NCM, Inc. by approximately $0.2 million.\nShare-Based Compensation\nNature of Estimates Required. NCM, Inc.'s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan and its 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the Equity Incentive Plans\u201d) are treated as equity plans under the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification ASC 718 - Compensation - Stock Compensation, and the determination of fair value of options, restricted stock and restricted stock units for accounting purposes requires that management make estimates and judgments. When stock options were granted prior to 2013, we used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants, which was affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions, including expected volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends.\nThe fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense equal to the fair value of each restricted stock award or restricted stock unit is recognized ratably over the requisite service period. Certain of the restricted stock awards include performance vesting conditions, which permit vesting to the extent that the Company achieves specified non-GAAP targets at the end of the measurement period. Compensation expense is based on management's projections and the probability of achievement of those expectations, which requires considerable judgment. We record a cumulative adjustment to share-based compensation expense in periods that we change our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest. Additionally, we ultimately adjust the expense recognized to reflect the actual vested shares following the resolution of the performance conditions. Further, for both stock options and restricted stock we estimate a forfeiture rate to reflect the potential separation of employees.\nAssumptions and Approach Used. In determining the value of stock options, we estimated an expected dividend yield based upon our expectation of the dividend that would be paid out on the underlying shares during the expected term of the\noption. Expected volatility is based on our historical stock prices using a mathematical formula to measure the standard deviation of the change in the natural logarithm of our underlying stock price over a period of time commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the zero coupon rate on U.S. Treasury instruments with a term commensurate with the award's expected term.\nFor restricted stock with vesting contingent on the achievement of Company performance conditions, the amount of compensation expense is estimated based on the expected achievement of the performance condition. This requires us to make estimates of the likelihood of the achievement of Company performance conditions, which is highly judgmental. We base our judgments as to the expected achievement of Company performance conditions based on the financial projections of the Company that are used by management for business purposes, which represent our best estimate of expected Company performance. We evaluate the assumptions used to value stock-based awards on a quarterly basis. If factors change and we employ different assumptions, stock-based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past. If there are any modifications or cancellations of stock-based awards, we may be required to accelerate, increase or decrease any remaining, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense. To the extent that we grant additional stock-based awards, compensation expense will increase in relation to the fair value of the additional grants. Compensation expense may be significantly impacted in the future to the extent our estimates differ from actual results. Further, we estimate a forfeiture rate of restricted stock based upon historical forfeitures. If future forfeitures differ significantly from our past experience our compensation expense may be significantly impacted.\nIncome Taxes\nNature of Estimates Required. We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 - Income Taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax amounts are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received, as provided under currently enacted tax law. Valuation allowances are to be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. We have incurred taxable losses in recent years due primarily to amortization of intangible assets recorded on our tax returns resulting from an election by NCM LLC made under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7754 of the Internal Revenue Code to step-up the Company's outside basis in its share of NCM LLC's inside basis of assets under IRC \u00a7743(b). We currently have no valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets as we expect future taxable income (as amortization of these items will cease) and we expect to be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration. Further, we have and continue to expect to generate pre-tax book income. In addition, due to the basis differences resulting from our IPO-related transactions (including the tax receivable agreement with the founding members) and subsequent adjustments pursuant to the common unit adjustment agreement, we are required to make cash payments under the tax receivable agreement to the founding members in amounts equal to 90% of our actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the basis difference for certain deferred assets noted above. The requirements of the tax receivable agreement, as amended, are highly technical and complex and involve management's judgment, including judgments to determine hypothetical tax outcomes exclusive of the IPO date transaction and agreements. If we were to fail to meet certain of the requirements of the tax receivable agreement, we could be subject to additional payments to taxing authorities or to the founding members. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position, that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution.\nWe have established a reserve for material, known tax exposures. As of December 29, 2016, the total amount of the tax reserve was $2.0 million, including accrued interest and penalties, net of related items. Our reserve reflects management's judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review or other settlement. While we believe our reserve is adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, there can be no assurance that, in all instances, an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed its related reserve. With respect to the reserve, our income tax expense would include (i) any changes in tax reserves arising from material changes during the period in the facts and circumstances (i.e., new information) surrounding a tax issue and (ii) any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period. Such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and could impact operating cash flows. While we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks, in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differs from our estimates, we may be exposed to material increases in income tax expense, which could materially impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Note 6 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nSensitivity Analysis. For fiscal 2016, our provision for income taxes was $9.2 million. Changes in management's estimates and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities, the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets, or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences and judgments used to determine hypothetical tax outcomes exclusive of the IPO date transaction and agreements could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate. A one percent change in the effective tax rate from 26.6% to 27.6% would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately $0.3 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the recent accounting pronouncements relevant to our business operations, refer to the information provided under Note 1 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nFor a discussion of the related-party transactions, refer to the information provided under Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur operating lease obligations, which primarily include office leases, are not reflected on our balance sheet. Refer to -Contractual and Other Obligations\u201d for further detail. We do not believe these arrangements are material to our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.\nContractual and Other Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 29, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Within\n1 fiscal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3\nfiscal years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5\nfiscal years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 285.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 650.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 935.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash interest on borrowings (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Office leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network affiliate agreements (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Payable to founding members under tax receivable\nagreement (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 161.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on payable to founding members under tax\nreceivable agreement (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 478.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 164.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 846.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,585.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We have a $175.0 million variable rate revolving credit facility of which $160.0 million was outstanding as of December 29, 2016.

The amount relating to the attendance factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theater attendance varies, while the amount relating to the digital screens and digital cinema systems will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens, other screens are added or removed through acquisition, divestiture or closure activities of the founding members and founding members convert to the higher quality digital cinema systems. The payments made to the founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated ESAs. The rate per attendee increases 8% every five years, with the next such increase taking effect for fiscal year 2017, while the rate per digital screen and digital cinema system screen increase 5% annually. The table above does not include amounts payable under the ESAs as they are based on variable factors, which are not capable of precise estimation.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature, coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and to a lesser extent the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry. Both advertising expenditures and theater attendance tend to be higher during the second, third, and fourth fiscal quarters. Advertising revenue is primarily correlated with new product releases, advertising client marketing priorities and economic cycles and to a lesser extent theater attendance levels. The actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending on these factors or other risks and uncertainties. Based on our historical experience, our first quarter typically has less revenue than the other quarters of a given year due primarily to lower advertising client demand and lower theater industry attendance levels. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future.\nThe following table reflects the quarterly percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended 2014, 2015 and 2016:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> First\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Second\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Third\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FY 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FY 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FY 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report includes the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the company.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion and analysis, the term net income refers to net income attributable to NCM, Inc.\nOverview\nWe are America's Movie Network. As the #1 weekend network for Millennials (age 18-34) in the U.S., we are the connector between brands and movie audiences. We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses in FirstLook, our cinema advertising and entertainment pre-show seen on movie screens across the U.S. We also sell advertising on our LEN, a series of strategically-placed screens located in movie theater lobbies, as well as other forms of advertising and promotions in theater lobbies. In addition, we sell online and mobile advertising through our Cinema Accelerator digital product to reach entertainment audiences beyond the theater. We have long-term ESAs (over 20 years remaining as of December 29, 2016) and multi-year agreements with network affiliates, which expire at various dates between July 14, 2017 and July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 18.1 years as of December 29, 2016. The ESAs and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theaters to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theater attendance is generated by theaters connected to our DCN (the remaining screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors).\nManagement focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings at least once per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed in Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d above, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local advertising pricing (CPM), local and regional advertising rate per screen per week, local and regional and total advertising revenue per attendee. We also monitor free cash flow, the dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA), cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Transactions\nOn May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) to merge with Screenvision. On November 3, 2014, the DOJ filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger. On March 16, 2015, NCM, Inc. announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members. On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million\nincurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the year ended December 31, 2015). NCM, Inc. and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred.\nOur operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nSummary Historical and Operating Data\nYou should read this information in conjunction with the other information contained in this document, and our audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nThe following table presents operating data and Adjusted OIBDA (dollars in millions, except share and margin data). Refer to Item 6. Selected Financial Data-Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d for a discussion of the calculation of Adjusted OIBDA and reconciliation to operating income.\n\nNM = Not meaningful.\n (1) Merger termination fee and related merger costs primarily include the merger termination payment and legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated merger with Screenvision. \n (2) Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC's advertising network, excluding screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theaters that are currently part of another cinema advertising network for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. \nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to the completion of the IPO, NCM LLC was wholly-owned by its founding members. In connection with the offering, NCM, Inc. purchased newly issued common membership units from NCM LLC and common membership units from NCM LLC's founding members, and became a member of and the sole manager of NCM LLC. We entered into several agreements to effect the reorganization and the financing transaction and certain amendments were made to the existing ESAs to govern the relationships among NCM LLC and NCM LLC's founding members after the completion of these transactions.\nThe results of operations data discussed herein were derived from the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accounting records of NCM, Inc. and should be read in conjunction with the notes thereto.\nWe have a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year ending on the first Thursday after December 25. Fiscal year 2014 contained 53 weeks. Fiscal years 2015 and 2016 contained 52 weeks. Our 2017 fiscal year will contain 52 weeks. Throughout this document, we refer to our fiscal years as set forth below:\n\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Years 2016 and 2015\nRevenue. Total revenue increased $1.1 million, or 0.2%, from $446.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $447.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The following is a summary of revenue by category (in millions):\n\nThe following table shows data on revenue per attendee for the years ended December 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\n\n (1) Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC's advertising network, excluding screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theaters for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $4.9 million, or 1.6%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from the founding members) was due primarily to a 9.6% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 29, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and a $5.4 million increase in online, mobile and other revenue not included in the inventory measured by impressions sold or by CPMs. The increase in national advertising CPMs was due primarily to higher CPMs on upfront commitments year over year and to a lesser extent higher CPMs in the scatter market as well. These increases to revenue were partially offset by an 8.2% decrease in impressions sold during the year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in impressions sold was due primarily to fewer impressions sold during the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in impressions sold resulted in a decrease in national inventory utilization, from 128.3% in 2015 to 118.4% in 2016 on a 0.8% decrease in network attendance. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our FirstLook pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $2.5 million, or 2.3%, decrease in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by a decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000, whereby they had a 6.9% decrease in contract volume and a 5.6% decrease in average contract value during 2016, compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000 was driven by fewer contracts that were greater than $1 million. This was\npartially offset by revenue from contracts less than $100,000 which increased 2.5% in contract volume primarily related to the expansion of our salesforce and diversification of our client base.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $1.3 million, or 4.3%, decrease in national advertising revenue from the founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a decrease of $3.0 million related to one of the founding members reducing the length of its beverage advertising unit by 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in beverage revenue CPMs. The 2016 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2014 to 2015, which increased 5.7%.\nOperating expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $23.9 million, or 8.0%, from $298.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $274.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The following table shows the changes in operating expense for the year ended December 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):\n\nAdvertising operating costs. Advertising operating costs decreased $0.8 million, or 2.6%, from $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.4 million decrease in personnel related expenses and $0.2 million lower on-screen production costs during year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.7 million, or 3.9%, from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $17.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2016 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in network maintenance costs related to our DCN.\nTheater access fees-founding members. Theater access fees increased $2.6 million, or 3.6%, from $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $75.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase was due to a $2.6 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. The $2.6 million increase in digital screen fees increased $1.5 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $1.1 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with higher quality digital cinema equipment. Theater access fees based upon founding member attendance remained consistent during 2016, compared to 2015 as founding member attendance remained flat year over year.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $0.5 million, or 0.7%, from $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $72.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in online publisher expense related to higher online and mobile revenue, a $0.8 million increase in marketing research expenses and $0.7 million due to a non-cash impairment charge on an investment obtained in exchange for advertising services. These increases to selling and marketing costs were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower commission and bonus expense during the year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $5.2 million, or 13.5%, from $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $43.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016 due primarily to a $3.0 million increase in CEO transition costs, which consisted primarily of severance and consulting costs to our former CEO, a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related costs related primarily to higher non-cash share based compensation expense associated with modifying equity awards with our former CEO, a $0.7 million increase in franchise and other non-income based tax expenses and a $0.6 million increase in professional service costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.6 million, or 11.2%, from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $35.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related primarily to founding member common unit adjustments, partially offset by lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. The merger termination fee and related merger costs were $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and approximately $7.5 million in primarily legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses increased $10.3 million, or 15.5%, from $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $76.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The following table shows the changes in non-operating expense for the years ended December 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in millions):\n\nThe increase in non-operating expense was due primarily to a $10.4 million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in the year ended December 29, 2016 as a result of the redemption of our Notes due 2021. The loss on early retirement of debt included an approximate $7.9 million redemption premium and the write-off of approximately $2.5 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. The interest on borrowings increased approximately $1.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the one-month period between the issuance of the Notes due 2026 in August 2016 and the redemption of the Notes due 2021 in September 2016, whereby interest was paid on both notes for one month, as well as, a higher LIBOR rate on our term loans during 2016 compared to 2015. These increases in non-operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the amortization of terminated derivatives as the amortization period ended in February 2015.\nNet income. Net income increased $10.0 million from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase of $25.0 million in operating income, as described above, and a decrease of $8.6 million in income tax expense due primarily to a change of $7.8 million for a reserve for uncertain tax positions as $4.9 million of reserve was added during 2015 and $2.9 million was reversed during 2016 as the statute of limitations expired in the period. These increases to net income were partially offset by an increase of $10.3 million in non-operating expense, as described above, and a $13.3 million increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nRevenue. Total revenue increased $52.5 million, or 13.3%, from $394.0 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $446.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following is a summary of revenue by category (in millions):\n\nThe following table shows data on revenue per attendee for the years ended December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2015 (in millions):\n\n (1) Represents the total attendance within NCM LLC's advertising network, excluding screens and attendance associated with certain AMC Rave and Cinemark Rave theaters for all periods presented. Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $51.1 million, or 20.0%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from the founding members) was due primarily to a 14.2% increase in impressions sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 and a 6.7% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase in impressions sold was driven by an increase in national inventory utilization from 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015 to 128.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an expansion of our client base and increased spending by certain existing clients, related in part to the success of our strategy to compete in the national television Upfront marketplace. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our FirstLook pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate. This increase in impressions sold was also driven by an increase in our network theater attendance of 0.9% related to an overall increase in cinema industry attendance resulting from a stronger film release schedule and the addition of new network screens. The increase in CPMs relates primarily to our successful Upfront sales campaign and strong scatter market.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $9.8 million, or 9.8%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase of $6.9 million, or 21.7%, in revenue from larger regional contracts (greater than $100,000). The volume of contracts greater than $100,000 increased 33.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 9.1% in average contract value of contracts greater than $100,000. The increase in volume of contracts greater than $100,000 was due to the stronger film release schedule and higher sales to agencies responsible for larger regional advertising budgets. Revenue from local contracts under $100,000 increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $8.4 million, or 21.9%, decrease in national advertising revenue from the founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed in Part 1, some of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d), as amended.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion and analysis, the term net income refers to net income attributable to NCM, Inc.\nOverview\nWe are America's Movie Network. As the #1 weekend network for Millennials (age 18-34) in the U.S., we are the connector between brands and movie audiences. We currently derive revenue principally from the sale of advertising to national, regional and local businesses in FirstLook, our cinema advertising and entertainment pre-show seen on movie screens across the U.S. We also sell advertising on our LEN, a series of strategically-placed screens located in movie theater lobbies, as well as other forms of advertising and promotions in theater lobbies. In addition, we sell online and mobile advertising through our Cinema Accelerator digital product to reach entertainment audiences beyond the theater. We have long-term ESAs (over 20 years remaining as of December 29, 2016) and multi-year agreements with network affiliates, which expire at various dates between July 14, 2017 and July 22, 2031. The weighted average remaining term (based on attendance) of the ESAs and the network affiliate agreements is 18.1 years as of December 29, 2016. The ESAs and network affiliate agreements grant NCM LLC exclusive rights in their theaters to sell advertising, subject to limited exceptions. Our FirstLook pre-show and LEN programming are distributed predominantly via satellite through our proprietary DCN. Approximately 98% of the aggregate founding member and network affiliate theater attendance is generated by theaters connected to our DCN (the remaining screens receive advertisements on USB drives) and 100% of the FirstLook pre-show is projected on digital projectors (90% digital cinema projectors and 10% LCD projectors).\nManagement focuses on several measurements that we believe provide us with the necessary ratios and key performance indicators to manage our business, determine how we are performing versus our internal goals and targets, and against the performance of our competitors and other benchmarks in the marketplace in which we operate. Senior executives hold meetings at least once per quarter with officers, managers and staff to discuss and analyze operating results and address significant variances to budget and prior year in an effort to identify trends and changes in our business. We focus on many operating metrics including changes in revenue, OIBDA, Adjusted OIBDA and Adjusted OIBDA margin, as defined and discussed in Notes to the Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data\u201d above, as some of our primary measurement metrics. In addition, we monitor our monthly advertising performance measurements, including advertising inventory utilization, national and local advertising pricing (CPM), local and regional advertising rate per screen per week, local and regional and total advertising revenue per attendee. We also monitor free cash flow, the dividend coverage ratio, financial leverage (net debt divided by Adjusted OIBDA), cash balances and revolving credit facility availability to ensure debt covenant compliance and that there is adequate cash availability to fund our working capital needs and debt obligations and current and future dividends declared by our Board of Directors.\nRecent Transactions\nOn May 5, 2014, NCM, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) to merge with Screenvision. On November 3, 2014, the DOJ filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin the merger. On March 16, 2015, NCM, Inc. announced the termination of the Merger Agreement and the lawsuit was dismissed. After the Merger Agreement was terminated, NCM LLC reimbursed NCM, Inc. for certain expenses pursuant to an indemnification agreement among NCM LLC, NCM, Inc. and the founding members. On March 17, 2015, NCM LLC paid Screenvision an approximate $26.8 million termination payment on behalf of NCM, Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2015, NCM LLC also either paid directly or reimbursed NCM, Inc. for the legal and other merger-related costs of approximately $15.0 million ($7.5 million\nincurred by NCM, Inc. during the year ended January 1, 2015 and approximately $7.5 million incurred by NCM LLC during the year ended December 31, 2015). NCM, Inc. and the founding members each bore a pro rata portion of the termination fee and the related merger expenses based on their aggregate ownership percentages in NCM LLC when the expenses were incurred.\nOur operating results may be affected by a variety of internal and external factors and trends described more fully in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nSummary Historical and Operating Data\nYou should read this information in conjunction with the other information contained in this document, and our audited historical financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.\nThe following table presents operating data and Adjusted OIBDA (dollars in millions, except share and margin data).

Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $4.9 million, or 1.6%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from the founding members) was due primarily to a 9.6% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 29, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and a $5.4 million increase in online, mobile and other revenue not included in the inventory measured by impressions sold or by CPMs. The increase in national advertising CPMs was due primarily to higher CPMs on upfront commitments year over year and to a lesser extent higher CPMs in the scatter market as well. These increases to revenue were partially offset by an 8.2% decrease in impressions sold during the year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in impressions sold was due primarily to fewer impressions sold during the first half of 2016, compared to the first half of 2015. The decrease in impressions sold resulted in a decrease in national inventory utilization, from 128.3% in 2015 to 118.4% in 2016 on a 0.8% decrease in network attendance. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our FirstLook pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $2.5 million, or 2.3%, decrease in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by a decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000, whereby they had a 6.9% decrease in contract volume and a 5.6% decrease in average contract value during 2016, compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue from contracts greater than $100,000 was driven by fewer contracts that were greater than $1 million. This was\npartially offset by revenue from contracts less than $100,000 which increased 2.5% in contract volume primarily related to the expansion of our salesforce and diversification of our client base.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $1.3 million, or 4.3%, decrease in national advertising revenue from the founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a decrease of $3.0 million related to one of the founding members reducing the length of its beverage advertising unit by 30 seconds beginning July 1, 2015, partially offset by a 5.7% increase in beverage revenue CPMs. The 2016 beverage revenue CPM is based on the change in CPM during segment one of the FirstLook pre-show from 2014 to 2015, which increased 5.7%.\nOperating expenses. Total operating expenses decreased $23.9 million, or 8.0%, from $298.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $274.6 million for the year ended December 29, 2016.

Advertising operating costs decreased $0.8 million, or 2.6%, from $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $30.0 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.4 million decrease in personnel related expenses and $0.2 million lower on-screen production costs during year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNetwork costs. Network costs decreased $0.7 million, or 3.9%, from $17.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $17.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2016 due primarily to a decrease of $0.5 million in network maintenance costs related to our DCN.\nTheater access fees-founding members. Theater access fees increased $2.6 million, or 3.6%, from $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $75.1 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase was due to a $2.6 million increase in the fee associated with the number of founding member digital screens that are connected to the DCN, including higher quality digital cinema projectors and related equipment. The $2.6 million increase in digital screen fees increased $1.5 million related to an annual 5% rate increase specified in the ESAs and $1.1 million from an increase in the number of founding member screens equipped with higher quality digital cinema equipment. Theater access fees based upon founding member attendance remained consistent during 2016, compared to 2015 as founding member attendance remained flat year over year.\nSelling and marketing costs. Selling and marketing costs increased $0.5 million, or 0.7%, from $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $72.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in online publisher expense related to higher online and mobile revenue, a $0.8 million increase in marketing research expenses and $0.7 million due to a non-cash impairment charge on an investment obtained in exchange for advertising services. These increases to selling and marketing costs were partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in personnel related expenses due primarily to lower commission and bonus expense during the year ended December 29, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAdministrative and other costs. Administrative and other costs increased $5.2 million, or 13.5%, from $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $43.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016 due primarily to a $3.0 million increase in CEO transition costs, which consisted primarily of severance and consulting costs to our former CEO, a $0.7 million increase in personnel-related costs related primarily to higher non-cash share based compensation expense associated with modifying equity awards with our former CEO, a $0.7 million increase in franchise and other non-income based tax expenses and a $0.6 million increase in professional service costs.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.6 million, or 11.2%, from $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $35.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase was due to an increase in amortization expense of intangible assets related primarily to founding member common unit adjustments, partially offset by lower depreciation expense as assets became fully depreciated.\nMerger termination fee and related merger costs. The merger termination fee and related merger costs were $34.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the merger termination payment of approximately $26.8 million and approximately $7.5 million in primarily legal, accounting, advisory and other professional fees associated with the terminated Screenvision merger.\nNon-operating expenses. Total non-operating expenses increased $10.3 million, or 15.5%, from $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $76.8 million for the year ended December 29, 2016.

The loss on early retirement of debt included an approximate $7.9 million redemption premium and the write-off of approximately $2.5 million in unamortized debt issuance costs. The interest on borrowings increased approximately $1.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due to the one-month period between the issuance of the Notes due 2026 in August 2016 and the redemption of the Notes due 2021 in September 2016, whereby interest was paid on both notes for one month, as well as, a higher LIBOR rate on our term loans during 2016 compared to 2015. These increases in non-operating expenses were partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in the amortization of terminated derivatives as the amortization period ended in February 2015.\nNet income. Net income increased $10.0 million from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.4 million for the year ended December 29, 2016. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase of $25.0 million in operating income, as described above, and a decrease of $8.6 million in income tax expense due primarily to a change of $7.8 million for a reserve for uncertain tax positions as $4.9 million of reserve was added during 2015 and $2.9 million was reversed during 2016 as the statute of limitations expired in the period. These increases to net income were partially offset by an increase of $10.3 million in non-operating expense, as described above, and a $13.3 million increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nFiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nRevenue. Total revenue increased $52.5 million, or 13.3%, from $394.0 million for the year ended January 1, 2015 to $446.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Refer to Note 4 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this document. \nNational advertising revenue. The $51.1 million, or 20.0%, increase in national advertising revenue (excluding beverage revenue from the founding members) was due primarily to a 14.2% increase in impressions sold during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015 and a 6.7% increase in national advertising CPMs (excluding beverage) during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015. The increase in impressions sold was driven by an increase in national inventory utilization from 115.7% for the year ended January 1, 2015 to 128.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an expansion of our client base and increased spending by certain existing clients, related in part to the success of our strategy to compete in the national television Upfront marketplace. Inventory utilization is calculated as utilized impressions divided by total advertising impressions, which is based on eleven 30-second salable national advertising units in our FirstLook pre-show, which can be expanded, should market demand dictate. This increase in impressions sold was also driven by an increase in our network theater attendance of 0.9% related to an overall increase in cinema industry attendance resulting from a stronger film release schedule and the addition of new network screens. The increase in CPMs relates primarily to our successful Upfront sales campaign and strong scatter market.\nLocal and regional advertising revenue. The $9.8 million, or 9.8%, increase in local and regional advertising revenue was driven by an increase of $6.9 million, or 21.7%, in revenue from larger regional contracts (greater than $100,000). The volume of contracts greater than $100,000 increased 33.9%, partially offset by a decrease of 9.1% in average contract value of contracts greater than $100,000. The increase in volume of contracts greater than $100,000 was due to the stronger film release schedule and higher sales to agencies responsible for larger regional advertising budgets. Revenue from local contracts under $100,000 increased 4.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended January 1, 2015.\nFounding member beverage revenue. The $8.4 million, or 21.9%, decrease in national advertising revenue from the founding members' beverage concessionaire agreements was due to a"}
