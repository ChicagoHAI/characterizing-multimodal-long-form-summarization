Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTrust Overview\nThe following review of Mesa Royalty Trust's (the \"Trust\") financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto. The discussion of net production attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (as each is defined below) represents production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the Trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production volumes. Any discussion of \"actual\" production volumes represents the hydrocarbons that were produced from the properties in which the Trust has an overriding royalty interest.\nThe Trust was created on November 1, 1979 and is now governed by the Mesa Royalty Trust Indenture (as amended, the \"Trust Indenture\"). Through a series of conveyances, assignments, and acquisitions, the Trust currently owns an overriding royalty interest (the \"Royalty\") equal to 11.44% of 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined and described in an Overriding Royalty Conveyance, dated as of November 1, 1979 (the \"Conveyance\")) attributable to the specified interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the:\n\u2022 Hugoton field of Kansas (the \"Hugoton Royalty Properties\");\n\u2022 San Juan Basin field of New Mexico (the \"San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties\");\n\u2022 San Juan Basin field of Colorado (the \"San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties\", and together with the \"San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, the \"San Juan Basin Royalty Properties\", and together with the Hugoton Royalty Properties, the \"Royalty Properties\").\nPursuant to past conveyances, Scout (formerly Riviera), Hilcorp, BP, and Red Willow are the operators of certain portions of the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (each of Scout, Hilcorp, BP, and Red Willow being a \"Working Interest Owner\", and together, the \"Working Interest Owners\"). As used in this report, Scout refers to the current operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, Hilcorp refers to the current operator of the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, and BP and Red Willow refer to the current co-operators of certain tracts of land included in the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe Trust is a passive entity whose purposes are limited to: (1) converting the Royalties to cash, either by retaining them and collecting the proceeds of production (until production has ceased or the Royalties are otherwise terminated) or by selling or otherwise disposing of the Royalties; and (2) distributing such cash, net of amounts for payments of liabilities to the Trust, to the unitholders. The Trust has no sources of liquidity or capital resources other than the revenues, if any, attributable to the Royalties and interest on cash held by the Trustee as a reserve for liabilities or for distribution. The Trust does not undertake or control any capital projects or make capital expenditures. While the Trust's\nRoyalty income is net of capital expenditures, these capital expenditures are controlled and paid by the Working Interests Owners, and the Trust receives Royalty income net of these expenses. In addition, the Trust does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other contingent obligations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity. As discussed in \"Business-Description of the Trust\" under Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the Trust's primary source of cash is the Royalty income received from its share of the net proceeds from the Royalty Properties, and the only other source of cash is interest income earned pursuant to the Trust Indenture. For estimates of future Royalty income attributable to the Royalty, refer to the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the Working Interest Owners reimburse the Trust each quarter for certain expenses incurred by the Trust on their behalf. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $23,629 and $0 of unreimbursed expenses, respectively. In accordance with the provisions of the Conveyance, generally all revenues received by the Trust, net of unreimbursed Trust administrative expenses and sums paid to or from any reserves established pursuant to the Trust Indenture, are distributed to the unitholders. The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that the Trustee may establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust, and may pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings. During 2011, the Trustee withheld $1.0 million to establish a reserve for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses in accordance with the Trust Indenture. At any given time, the balance of the Contingent Reserve is included in cash and short-term investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $56,793 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (3) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 and (5) $843 due to an overpayment received in error from BP in December 2019 that was deducted from BP's January 2020 payment to the Trust.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (2) $38,364 for a cash refund of a duplicate payment from a vendor received in November 2018 and distributed to unitholders in February 2019, (3) $56,794 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (5) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 which refund was included in the distribution to unitholders in November 2019 and (6) and $23,629 for a reimbursement not received from Scout but included in the December 2019 distribution to unitholders. The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $977,212 as of December 31, 2019.\nSee \"Financial Review-Unreimbursed Expenses and the Contingent Reserve\" for complete information about adjustments to the Contingent Reserve for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCapital Resources. The Trust is a passive entity that does not undertake or control any capital projects or make capital expenditures. While the Trust's Royalty income is net of capital expenditures,\nthese capital expenditures are controlled and paid by the Working Interests Owners, and the Trust receives Royalty income net of these expenses. Therefore, the Trust has no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nSUMMARY OF ROYALTY INCOME, PRODUCTION, PRICES AND COSTS (Unaudited)\nTable 10:

are net of a volumetric in-kind processing fee retained by Scout and Hilcorp, respectively.\n(2)Royalty income is computed after deducting the Trust's proportionate share of capital costs, operating costs and interest on any cost carryforward from the Trust's proportionate share of Gross Proceeds. As a result of excess production costs incurred in one monthly operating period and then recovered in a subsequent monthly operating period, the Royalty income paid to the Trust may not agree to the Trust's royalty interest in the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance). The excess production costs must be recovered by the Working Interest Owners before any distribution of Royalty income will be made to the Trust.\nSan Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $5,321 and $4,948 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp were approximately $373 and $0 for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust recovered prior period excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp of $1,121 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSan Juan Basin-Colorado Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $29,597 and $2,957 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow were approximately $26,641 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust recovered $12,987 prior period excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3)Average production costs attributable to the Royalty are calculated as stated capital costs plus operating costs, divided by stated net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid. As noted above in footnote (2), production costs may be incurred in one operating period and then recovered in a subsequent operating period, which may cause Royalty income paid to the Trust not to agree to the Trust's Royalty interest in the Net Proceeds.\n(4)Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty are determined by dividing Royalty income by the average sales price received. Any differences noted are due to rounding.\n(5)Following Hilcorp's acquisition of ConocoPhillips' and XTO's interests in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, there was a transition period to transfer historical information, knowledge and processes from one owner to the other. During this transition period, Hilcorp recorded estimates of revenues and expenses and made payments to the Trust based on historical amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips, and the Trust recognized such amounts in accordance with its modified cash basis of accounting. Accordingly, Hilcorp made an estimated monthly payment of $97,150 in Net Proceeds to the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 based upon the July 2017 production month previously paid by ConocoPhillips. In April 2019, Hilcorp began to generate actual (instead of estimated) Net Proceeds due to the Trust on a monthly basis. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will utilize actual revenue and expense amounts and either add or subtract reconciled historical amounts on a month by month basis, which will be recognized over time by the Trust in accordance with the Trust's modified cash basis of accounting. In December 2019, Hilcorp made the first payment to the Trust reconciling historical amounts, which was in the amount of $29,698 for the accounting month of September 2017 and was the only reconciliation payment made by Hilcorp during 2019. Until all estimated historical monthly amounts received by the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 are fully reconciled and adjusted, Net Proceeds from the San Juan-New Mexico Properties will reflect adjustments to actual current production and costs to account for historical monthly reconciliations as they are completed. Because of anticipated future adjustments, the amounts\nof Net Proceeds reported for the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be representative of Net Proceeds that will be received in future years.\nHilcorp has informed the Trust that significant incremental costs of approximately $1.1 million attributable to the Trust were incurred in 2018 with respect to a newly drilled well in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Incremental costs attributable to the Trust will reduce the Trust's future Net Proceeds over a period of time as adjustments are made by Hilcorp after taking into account actual revenues as well as costs for these properties during the applicable time period. The potential impact to Net Proceeds depends upon the results of all of the reconciliation work currently being conducted by Hilcorp and is therefore uncertain. The Trust will undertake a review of the reconciliation calculations by Hilcorp and the amount of Net Proceeds calculated and paid and intends to engage third party consultants when appropriate to assist in the Trust's review.\nPursuant to the Trust Indenture, the Trust is not required to pay to Hilcorp any amounts that could be owed if the estimated revenue exceeded actual revenue amounts or estimated expenses were less than actual expense amounts in past periods. However, Hilcorp may recover such amounts by withholding a portion or all of the Net Proceeds that would otherwise be payable to the Trust in subsequent periods. This could result in a decrease in Net Proceeds paid to the Trust and could result in future material reductions in distributions to the Trust's unitholders.\nFinancial Review\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,808,378 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,332,319 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,951 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(202,747 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(217,138 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributable income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,635,046 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,138,132 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributable income per unit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>0.8774 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.1473 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty and Interest Income. The Trust's Royalty income was $1,808,378 and $2,332,319 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily a result of lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, increased operating and capital costs for natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil and condensate and lower net natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes, partially offset by higher prices and volumes for oil and condensate for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Trust's Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $29,415 and $22,951, respectively. In accordance with the Trust Indenture and as explained below, interest on cash on hand was paid at a rate equivalent to 1.5% below the prime interest rate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense was $202,747 and $217,138 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trustee's fees are included in general and administrative expense.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee was due $475,000 for its services. The Trust paid $433,153 of this amount to the Trustee, and $41,847 was allocated to offset against interest due to the Trust under the Trust Indenture. The Trust Indenture requires that cash being held by the Trustee earn interest at 1.5% below the prime rate, which would have yielded the Trust a 4.00% annualized return from January 1, 2019 through July 31, 2019, a 3.75% annualized return from August 1, 2019 through September 18, 2019, a 3.5% annualized return from September 19, 2019 through October 30, 2019 and a 3.25% annualized return from October 31, 2019 through December 31, 2019. However, due to the current interest rate environment, the Trustee was unable to obtain an account in which such an interest rate was available. In the event such an interest rate is unavailable in the future, the Trustee intends to allocate certain of its fees due to the Trust to meet the minimum interest rate payable under the Trust Indenture. In future periods the Trustee will continue to allocate a portion of the fees earned for its services to the Trust until all remaining interest due to the Trust is fully offset.\nUnreimbursed Expenses and the Contingent Reserve. The Working Interest Owners partially reimburse the Trust each quarter for amounts paid in connection with the Trustee's services. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee's aggregate fees were $433,153 and the Working Interest Owners reimbursed the aggregate sum of $383,588 to the Trustee, which was the same amount reimbursed for the year ended December 21, 2018. As of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Trust incurred unreimbursed expenses of $23,629 and $0, respectively.\nDuring 2011, the Trustee, acting pursuant to the Trust Indenture, withheld $1.0 million to establish the Contingent Reserve, with such amount being included in cash and short-term investments. The Trustee reserves the right to determine whether or not to release cash reserves in future periods with respect to any reimbursement expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $56,793 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (3) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 and (5) $843 due to an overpayment received in error from BP in December 2019 that was deducted from BP's January 2020 payment to the Trust.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (2) $38,364 for a cash refund of a duplicate payment from a vendor received in November 2018 and distributed to unitholders in February 2019, (3) $56,794 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (5) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 which refund was included in the distribution to unitholders in November 2019 and (6) and $23,629 for a reimbursement not received from Scout but included in the December 2019 distribution to unitholders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $55,725 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2018, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $3,627 of Royalty income received from BP in June 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of June 2018, which Royalty income was included in the July 2018 distribution to unitholders, (3) $14,501 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera in June 2018 but included in the June 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in July 2018, (4) $3,000 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera in September 2018 but included in the September 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in October 2018 and (5) $38,364 cash refund from a vendor received in November 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $49,211 of Royalty income received from BP in December 2017 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of December 2017, which Royalty income was included in the January 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $70,460 of December 2017 expenses that were included in the distribution calculation for December 2017, but not paid by the Trust until January 2018, (3) $55,725 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2018, which Royalty income was included in the April\ndistribution to unitholders, (4) $3,627 of Royalty income received from BP in June 2018 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of June 2018, which Royalty income was included in the July 2018 distribution to unitholders, (5) $14,501 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera in June 2018 but included in the June 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in July 2018 and (6) $3,000 of general and administrative expense not reimbursed by Riviera in September 2018 but included in the September 2018 distribution to unitholders, which reimbursement was received in October 2018. The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $1,038,364 as of December 31, 2018.\nDistributable Income Available for Distribution. The portion of the Trust's distributable income available for distribution each year includes the Royalty income received from the Working Interest Owners during such period, plus interest income earned to the date of distribution (if any) and increases or withdrawals to and from the Contingent Reserve (if any). Distributable income available for distribution for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1,696,197 and $2,219,438, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Trust calculated total aggregate distributions of $0.910 and $1.191 per unit, respectively.\nOperational Review\nHugoton Royalty Properties\nRoyalty Income. Royalty income attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $475,511 and $759,039, respectively. The decrease of approximately 37% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily due to lower natural gas liquids prices and decreased net natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes, offset in part by lower operating costs from the Hugoton Royalty Properties in fiscal year 2019.\nOperating Costs and Capital Expenditures. Operating costs attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $1,155,250 and $1,194,128, respectively.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas </th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas\nLiquids </th> <th> </th> <th>Oil and\nCondensate </th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas </th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas\nLiquids </th> <th> </th> <th>Oil and\nCondensate </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average sales price\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3.52 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>21.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>3.46 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>25.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Mcf </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Mcf </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Actual production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid for Hugoton Royalty Properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>360,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>382,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid for Hugoton Royalty Properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Sales Prices. Average sales prices per Mcf of natural gas and Bbl for natural gas liquids for the Hugoton Royalty Properties is directly dependent on the prices Scout realizes for natural gas sold under short-term and multi-month contracts at market clearing prices to multiple purchasers.\nOn April 18, 2018, Linn announced its Board of Directors' decision to separate Linn into two stand-alone public companies. On August 7, 2018 Linn completed the spin-off of Riviera through the\npro rata distribution of all of the shares of Riviera's outstanding common stock to Linn's stockholders. In connection with such distribution, Linn ceased to be the operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, and since August 7, 2018, Riviera operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties. On November 22, 2019, Riviera completed the sale of its interest in its remaining properties located in the Hugoton Basin under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated August 28, 2019 (the \"Purchase Agreement\"), by and between the Riviera Upstream, LLC, Riviera Operating, LLC and Scout Energy Group V, LP (\"Scout\"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Riviera divested all of its interest in its oil and gas assets and contracts in the Hugoton Royalty Properties. Since November 23, 2019, Scout has operated the Hugoton Royalty Properties.\nSan Juan Basin Royalty Properties\nRoyalty income from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is calculated and paid to the Trust on a state-by-state basis depending upon whether the property is situated in Colorado and New Mexico. The majority of the Royalty income from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is attributable to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Substantially all of the natural gas produced from the San Juan Basin Royalty Properties is currently being sold in the spot market.\nSan Juan Basin-Colorado Properties\nRoyalty Income. Royalty income attributable to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $461,771 and $407,483, respectively. The increase of approximately 13% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily due to increased net natural gas production volumes and higher prices for natural gas, offset in part by higher operating costs from the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties.\nOperating Costs and Capital Expenditures. Operating costs attributable to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $129,665 and $119,564, respectively.

The decrease of approximately 25% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily due to lower prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, decreased net production volumes for natural gas and natural gas liquids and higher operating and capital expenditures, partially offset by\nhigher prices and increased net production for oil and condensate for the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties.\nOperating Costs and Capital Expenditures. Operating costs attributable to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $901,584 and $732,474, respectively. The increase of approximately 23% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018 was primarily due to maintenance expense reductions in 2017 that continued to be used by Hilcorp as estimates through the first quarter of 2019. Capital expenditures on these properties were $66,650 for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of approximately $59,381 as compared to $7,269 for the year ended December 31, 2018 due primarily to very low capital investment in 2017 that continued to be used by Hilcorp as an estimate through the first quarter of 2019 and the addition in 2019 of well zone recompletes that bring on new zones of production and reserves.\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2019 </th> <th> </th> <th>2018 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas </th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas\nLiquids </th> <th> </th> <th>Oil and\nCondensate </th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas </th> <th> </th> <th>Natural\nGas\nLiquids </th> <th> </th> <th>Oil and\nCondensate </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average sales price\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1.63 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>16.00 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>44.39 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2.04 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>16.28 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>37.59 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Mcf </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Mcf </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(Bbls </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Actual production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid for San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>620,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>643 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid for San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,567 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFollowing Hilcorp's acquisition of ConocoPhillips' and XTO's interests in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, there was a transition period to transfer historical information, knowledge and processes from one owner to the other. During this transition period, Hilcorp recorded estimates of revenues and expenses and made payments to the Trust based on historical amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips, and the Trust recognized such amounts in accordance with its modified cash basis of accounting. Accordingly, Hilcorp made an estimated monthly payment of $97,150 in Net Proceeds to the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 based upon the July 2017 production month previously paid by ConocoPhillips. In April 2019, Hilcorp began to generate actual (instead of estimated) Net Proceeds due to the Trust on a monthly basis. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will utilize actual revenue and expense amounts and either add or subtract reconciled historical amounts on a month by month basis, which will be recognized over time by the Trust in accordance with the Trust's modified cash basis of accounting. In December 2019, Hilcorp made the first payment to the Trust reconciling historical amounts, which was in the amount of $29,698 for the accounting month of September 2017 and was the only reconciliation payment made by Hilcorp during 2019. Until all estimated historical monthly amounts received by the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 are fully reconciled and adjusted, Net Proceeds from the San Juan-New Mexico Properties will reflect adjustments to actual current production and costs to account for historical monthly reconciliations as they are completed. Because of anticipated future adjustments, the amounts of Net Proceeds reported for the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be representative of Net Proceeds that will be received in future years.\nHilcorp has informed the Trust that significant incremental costs of approximately $1.1 million attributable to the Trust were incurred in 2018 with respect to a newly drilled well in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Incremental costs attributable to the Trust will reduce the Trust's future Net Proceeds over a period of time as adjustments are made by Hilcorp after taking into account\nactual revenues as well as costs for these properties during the applicable time period. The potential impact to Net Proceeds depends upon the results of all of the reconciliation work currently being conducted by Hilcorp and is therefore uncertain. The Trust will undertake a review of the reconciliation calculations by Hilcorp and the amount of Net Proceeds calculated and paid and intends to engage third party consultants when appropriate to assist in the Trust's review.\nPursuant to the Trust Indenture, the Trust is not required to pay to Hilcorp any amounts that could be owed if the estimated revenue exceeded actual revenue amounts or estimated expenses were less than actual expense amounts in past periods. However, Hilcorp may recover such amounts by withholding a portion or all of the Net Proceeds that would otherwise be payable to the Trust in subsequent periods. This could result in a decrease in Net Proceeds paid to the Trust and could result in future material reductions in distributions to the Trust's unitholders.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations\nNone.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe financial statements of the Trust are prepared on the following basis:\n(a) Royalty income recorded for a month is the amount computed and paid by the Working Interest Owners to the Trustee for such month rather than either the value of a portion of the oil and gas produced by the Working Interest Owners for such month or the amount subsequently determined to be the Trust's proportionate share of the net proceeds for such month;\n(b) Interest income, interest receivable and distributions payable to unitholders include interest to be earned on short-term investments from the financial statement date through the next date of distribution;\n(c) Trust general and administrative expenses, net of reimbursements, are recorded in the month they are included in the calculation of the monthly distribution amount;\n(d) Amortization of the Royalty is computed on a unit-of-production basis and is charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect distributable income; and\n(e) Distributions payable are determined on a monthly basis and are payable to unitholders of record as of the last business day of each month or such later date as the Trustee determines is required to comply with applicable law or stock exchange requirements.\nThis basis for reporting distributable income is considered to be the most meaningful because distributions to the unitholders for a month are based on net cash receipts for such month. However, these statements differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States because, under such principles, royalty income for a month would be based on net proceeds from production for such month without regard to when calculated or received, general and administrative expenses would be recorded in the month they accrue, and interest income for a month would be calculated only through the end of such month.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of Mesa Royalty Trust's financial condition and operations, focusing on the trust's ownership of an overriding royalty interest in oil and gas properties.

Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nTrust Overview\nThe following review of Mesa Royalty Trust's (the \"Trust\") financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto. The discussion of net production attributable to the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (as each is defined below) represents production volumes that are to a large extent hypothetical as the Trust does not own and is not entitled to any specific production volumes. Any discussion of \"actual\" production volumes represents the hydrocarbons that were produced from the properties in which the Trust has an overriding royalty interest.\nThe Trust was created on November 1, 1979 and is now governed by the Mesa Royalty Trust Indenture (as amended, the \"Trust Indenture\"). Through a series of conveyances, assignments, and acquisitions, the Trust currently owns an overriding royalty interest (the \"Royalty\") equal to 11.44% of 90% of the Net Proceeds (as defined and described in an Overriding Royalty Conveyance, dated as of November 1, 1979 (the \"Conveyance\")) attributable to the specified interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the:\n\u2022 Hugoton field of Kansas (the \"Hugoton Royalty Properties\");\n\u2022 San Juan Basin field of New Mexico (the \"San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties\");\n\u2022 San Juan Basin field of Colorado (the \"San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties\", and together with the \"San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, the \"San Juan Basin Royalty Properties\", and together with the Hugoton Royalty Properties, the \"Royalty Properties\").\nPursuant to past conveyances, Scout (formerly Riviera), Hilcorp, BP, and Red Willow are the operators of certain portions of the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties (each of Scout, Hilcorp, BP, and Red Willow being a \"Working Interest Owner\", and together, the \"Working Interest Owners\"). As used in this report, Scout refers to the current operator of the Hugoton Royalty Properties, Hilcorp refers to the current operator of the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, and BP and Red Willow refer to the current co-operators of certain tracts of land included in the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe Trust is a passive entity whose purposes are limited to: (1) converting the Royalties to cash, either by retaining them and collecting the proceeds of production (until production has ceased or the Royalties are otherwise terminated) or by selling or otherwise disposing of the Royalties; and (2) distributing such cash, net of amounts for payments of liabilities to the Trust, to the unitholders. The Trust has no sources of liquidity or capital resources other than the revenues, if any, attributable to the Royalties and interest on cash held by the Trustee as a reserve for liabilities or for distribution. The Trust does not undertake or control any capital projects or make capital expenditures. While the Trust's\nRoyalty income is net of capital expenditures, these capital expenditures are controlled and paid by the Working Interests Owners, and the Trust receives Royalty income net of these expenses. In addition, the Trust does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other contingent obligations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity. As discussed in \"Business-Description of the Trust\" under Item 1 of this Form 10-K, the Trust's primary source of cash is the Royalty income received from its share of the net proceeds from the Royalty Properties, and the only other source of cash is interest income earned pursuant to the Trust Indenture. For estimates of future Royalty income attributable to the Royalty, refer to the Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the Working Interest Owners reimburse the Trust each quarter for certain expenses incurred by the Trust on their behalf. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were $23,629 and $0 of unreimbursed expenses, respectively. In accordance with the provisions of the Conveyance, generally all revenues received by the Trust, net of unreimbursed Trust administrative expenses and sums paid to or from any reserves established pursuant to the Trust Indenture, are distributed to the unitholders. The terms of the Trust Indenture provide, among other things, that the Trustee may establish cash reserves and borrow funds to pay liabilities of the Trust, and may pledge assets of the Trust to secure payment of the borrowings. During 2011, the Trustee withheld $1.0 million to establish a reserve for future unknown contingent liabilities and expenses in accordance with the Trust Indenture. At any given time, the balance of the Contingent Reserve is included in cash and short-term investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee increased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $56,793 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2018 distribution to unitholders, (2) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (3) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 and (5) $843 due to an overpayment received in error from BP in December 2019 that was deducted from BP's January 2020 payment to the Trust.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Trustee decreased the Contingent Reserve by (1) $434 for a duplicated general and administrative expense paid in error by the Trust in February 2019 and not refunded to the Trust until April 2019, (2) $38,364 for a cash refund of a duplicate payment from a vendor received in November 2018 and distributed to unitholders in February 2019, (3) $56,794 of Royalty income received from BP in March 2019 after the distribution to unitholders had been announced for the month of March 2019, which Royalty income was included in the April 2019 distribution to unitholders, (4) $317 underpaid by Riviera in June 2019 due to a 2018 Ad Valorem tax under accrual but included in the June 2019 distribution to unitholders, which amount was then excluded from the July 2019 distribution to unitholders, (5) $812 due to a refund received from a vendor in September 2019 which refund was included in the distribution to unitholders in November 2019 and (6) and $23,629 for a reimbursement not received from Scout but included in the December 2019 distribution to unitholders. The net effects of the foregoing adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in the balance of the Contingent Reserve being equal to $977,212 as of December 31, 2019.\nSee \"Financial Review-Unreimbursed Expenses and the Contingent Reserve\" for complete information about adjustments to the Contingent Reserve for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCapital Resources. The Trust is a passive entity that does not undertake or control any capital projects or make capital expenditures. While the Trust's Royalty income is net of capital expenditures,\nthese capital expenditures are controlled and paid by the Working Interests Owners, and the Trust receives Royalty income net of these expenses. Therefore, the Trust has no material commitments for capital expenditures.\nYears Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nSUMMARY OF ROYALTY INCOME, PRODUCTION, PRICES AND COSTS (Unaudited)\n\n(1)Gross Proceeds from natural gas liquids attributable to each of the Hugoton Royalty Properties and San Juan Basin Royalty Properties are net of a volumetric in-kind processing fee retained by Scout and Hilcorp, respectively.\n(2)Royalty income is computed after deducting the Trust's proportionate share of capital costs, operating costs and interest on any cost carryforward from the Trust's proportionate share of Gross Proceeds. As a result of excess production costs incurred in one monthly operating period and then recovered in a subsequent monthly operating period, the Royalty income paid to the Trust may not agree to the Trust's royalty interest in the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance). The excess production costs must be recovered by the Working Interest Owners before any distribution of Royalty income will be made to the Trust.\nSan Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $5,321 and $4,948 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp were approximately $373 and $0 for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust recovered prior period excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp of $1,121 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSan Juan Basin-Colorado Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $29,597 and $2,957 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow were approximately $26,641 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust recovered $12,987 prior period excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3)Average production costs attributable to the Royalty are calculated as stated capital costs plus operating costs, divided by stated net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid. As noted above in footnote (2), production costs may be incurred in one operating period and then recovered in a subsequent operating period, which may cause Royalty income paid to the Trust not to agree to the Trust's Royalty interest in the Net Proceeds.\n(4)Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty are determined by dividing Royalty income by the average sales price received. Any differences noted are due to rounding.\n(5)Following Hilcorp's acquisition of ConocoPhillips' and XTO's interests in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, there was a transition period to transfer historical information, knowledge and processes from one owner to the other. During this transition period, Hilcorp recorded estimates of revenues and expenses and made payments to the Trust based on historical amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips, and the Trust recognized such amounts in accordance with its modified cash basis of accounting. Accordingly, Hilcorp made an estimated monthly payment of $97,150 in Net Proceeds to the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 based upon the July 2017 production month previously paid by ConocoPhillips. In April 2019, Hilcorp began to generate actual (instead of estimated) Net Proceeds due to the Trust on a monthly basis. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will utilize actual revenue and expense amounts and either add or subtract reconciled historical amounts on a month by month basis, which will be recognized over time by the Trust in accordance with the Trust's modified cash basis of accounting. In December 2019, Hilcorp made the first payment to the Trust reconciling historical amounts, which was in the amount of $29,698 for the accounting month of September 2017 and was the only reconciliation payment made by Hilcorp during 2019. Until all estimated historical monthly amounts received by the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 are fully reconciled and adjusted, Net Proceeds from the San Juan-New Mexico Properties will reflect adjustments to actual current production and costs to account for historical monthly reconciliations as they are completed. Because of anticipated future adjustments, the amounts\nof Net Proceeds reported for the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be representative of Net Proceeds that will be received in future years.\nHilcorp has informed the Trust that significant incremental costs of approximately $1.1 million attributable to the Trust were incurred in 2018 with respect to a newly drilled well in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Incremental costs attributable to the Trust will reduce the Trust's future Net Proceeds over a period of time as adjustments are made by Hilcorp after taking into account actual revenues as well as costs for these properties during the applicable time period. The potential impact to Net Proceeds depends upon the results of all of the reconciliation work currently being conducted by Hilcorp and is therefore uncertain. The Trust will undertake a review of the reconciliation calculations by Hilcorp and the amount of Net Proceeds calculated and paid and intends to engage third party consultants when appropriate", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

are net of a volumetric in-kind processing fee retained by Scout and Hilcorp, respectively.\n(2)Royalty income is computed after deducting the Trust's proportionate share of capital costs, operating costs and interest on any cost carryforward from the Trust's proportionate share of Gross Proceeds. As a result of excess production costs incurred in one monthly operating period and then recovered in a subsequent monthly operating period, the Royalty income paid to the Trust may not agree to the Trust's royalty interest in the Net Proceeds (as defined in the Conveyance). The excess production costs must be recovered by the Working Interest Owners before any distribution of Royalty income will be made to the Trust.\nSan Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $5,321 and $4,948 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp were approximately $373 and $0 for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust recovered prior period excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties formerly operated by XTO, currently operated by Hilcorp of $1,121 during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSan Juan Basin-Colorado Properties. Excess production costs in the amount of $29,597 and $2,957 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow. Excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow were approximately $26,641 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Trust recovered $12,987 prior period excess production costs related to the San Juan Basin-Colorado Properties operated by Red Willow during the year ended December 31, 2018.\n(3)Average production costs attributable to the Royalty are calculated as stated capital costs plus operating costs, divided by stated net production volumes attributable to the Royalty paid. As noted above in footnote (2), production costs may be incurred in one operating period and then recovered in a subsequent operating period, which may cause Royalty income paid to the Trust not to agree to the Trust's Royalty interest in the Net Proceeds.\n(4)Net production volumes attributable to the Royalty are determined by dividing Royalty income by the average sales price received. Any differences noted are due to rounding.\n(5)Following Hilcorp's acquisition of ConocoPhillips' and XTO's interests in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties, there was a transition period to transfer historical information, knowledge and processes from one owner to the other. During this transition period, Hilcorp recorded estimates of revenues and expenses and made payments to the Trust based on historical amounts previously paid by ConocoPhillips, and the Trust recognized such amounts in accordance with its modified cash basis of accounting. Accordingly, Hilcorp made an estimated monthly payment of $97,150 in Net Proceeds to the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 based upon the July 2017 production month previously paid by ConocoPhillips. In April 2019, Hilcorp began to generate actual (instead of estimated) Net Proceeds due to the Trust on a monthly basis. Hilcorp has informed the Trust that it will utilize actual revenue and expense amounts and either add or subtract reconciled historical amounts on a month by month basis, which will be recognized over time by the Trust in accordance with the Trust's modified cash basis of accounting. In December 2019, Hilcorp made the first payment to the Trust reconciling historical amounts, which was in the amount of $29,698 for the accounting month of September 2017 and was the only reconciliation payment made by Hilcorp during 2019. Until all estimated historical monthly amounts received by the Trust from September 2017 to March 2019 are fully reconciled and adjusted, Net Proceeds from the San Juan-New Mexico Properties will reflect adjustments to actual current production and costs to account for historical monthly reconciliations as they are completed. Because of anticipated future adjustments, the amounts\nof Net Proceeds reported for the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be representative of Net Proceeds that will be received in future years.\nHilcorp has informed the Trust that significant incremental costs of approximately $1.1 million attributable to the Trust were incurred in 2018 with respect to a newly drilled well in the San Juan Basin-New Mexico Properties. Incremental costs attributable to the Trust will reduce the Trust's future Net Proceeds over a period of time as adjustments are made by Hilcorp after taking into account actual revenues as well as costs for these properties during the applicable time period. The potential impact to Net Proceeds depends upon the results of all of the reconciliation work currently being conducted by Hilcorp and is therefore uncertain. The Trust will undertake a review of the reconciliation calculations by Hilcorp and the amount of Net Proceeds calculated and paid and intends to engage third party consultants when appropriate"}
