Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(In thousands, except share and per-share data)\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this Annual Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCertain information contained in this discussion is or may be considered forward-looking. Forward-looking statements relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that involve certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, they could be inaccurate. Our actual future revenues and income could differ materially from our expected results. We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nConsolidated Summary\nWe are a leading global provider of investment processing, investment management and investment operations platforms. We help corporations, financial institutions, financial advisors and ultra-high-net-worth families create and manage wealth by providing comprehensive, innovative, investment and investment-business platforms. Investment processing fees are earned as monthly fees for contracted services, including computer processing services, software licenses and investment operations services, as well as transaction-based fees for providing securities valuation and trade-execution. Investment operations and investment management fees are earned as a percentage of average assets under management, administration or advised assets. As of December 31, 2017, through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest, we manage, advise or administer $860.6 billion in hedge, private equity, mutual fund and pooled or separately managed assets, including $337.3 billion in assets under management and $518.4 billion in client assets under administration. Our affiliate, LSV Asset Management (LSV), manages $105.3 billion of assets which are included as assets under management.\nOur Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015 were:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,526,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,401,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,334,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,129,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,025,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>975,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>396,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>358,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain (loss) from investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net of interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>508,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>174,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>333,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>331,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted earnings per common share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Variances noted \"NM\" indicate the percent change is not meaningful.\nSignificant Items Impacting Our Financial Results in 2017\nRevenues increased $125.0 million, or nine percent, to $1.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016.

The capabilities of the Platform have and continue to expand the services we offer to large global financial institutions, investment advisors, and other similar institutions and provide us the opportunity to enter into new markets.\nThe SEI Wealth Platform has primarily been offered under the Platform as a Service (PaaS) business model. The SEI Wealth Platform (PaaS) model includes client acquisition, portfolio management, enrollment and a unified product catalog that contains a single location for all of the client's investment products used to construct model portfolios as well as enabling\nPage 21 of 80\nthe Investment Advisors business segment to enter into the flexible turn-key asset management platform (TAMP) market by providing clients with access to third-party funds, ETFs, equities, fixed-income and alternative investments into portfolios that are not currently available.\nOur recent development efforts include offering the SEI Wealth Platform through a Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery mode to serve different types of clients in the wealth management marketplace. The SEI Wealth Platform (SaaS) business model will target the large bank marketplace and is expected to create significant revenue and cash flow opportunity. We believe both business models have received market acceptance as evidenced by the signing of Wells Fargo Bank (Wells Fargo) for the SaaS model and the installation of Regions Bank (Regions) for the PaaS model.\nThe technical and business validation of the configuration and data migration for the conversion of the entire Wells Fargo wealth management business under the Saas model is currently in progress and meeting expectations. In early October 2017, Regions began operating on the Platform in a live environment and we completed our largest conversion of Investment Advisors segment clients to date.\nThe Platform provides an enabling technology infrastructure for our businesses and clients for the future and was built using mainstream technologies using market-leading vendors. It is our expectation that the operating system, the database operating platform and the software programming language which comprise the underlying architecture will allow it to adapt to both market changes and technology changes over time. We believe the breadth of the services offered through the Platform provide us an advantage over our competitors. These services are core functions to the global financial services industry regardless of current market conditions. The global financial services industry is highly regulated and demand for the capabilities of the Platform is only expected to increase.\nThe initial version of the Platform was placed into service in July 2007 with an estimated useful life of 15 years. All significant enhancements to the Platform were originally being amortized over the remaining useful life and would have been fully expensed by June 2022. As a result of these recent developments, we adjusted the remaining useful life of certain components and functionality of the Platform effective October 1, 2017. After the adjustment of these components and as of December 31, 2017, the Platform has a weighted average remaining life of 8.2 years. Based upon our assessment, we estimate amortization expense related to components and functionality of the Platform currently in use as of December 31, 2017 will be approximately $9.7 million during the first quarter 2018. This estimate does not include our software development costs in-progress associated with future releases of the Platform of $38.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The release date for these capitalized software development costs in-progress has not yet been determined.\nAdditionally, future enhancements to the Platform may replace significant existing components or functionality. Once new enhancements are completed and ready to be placed into service, existing components or functionality that are being replaced may be abandoned. If this occurs, the remaining net book value of the previously capitalized software development costs related to the Platform will be expensed over the remaining useful life of those components or written off.\nAs we progress through the different stages of deployment of the Platform to a broader market, we expect to encounter numerous challenges; however, the Platform promises to provide a significant opportunity to expand our services into new markets that will increase revenues and profits in the long term. Until we attain a level of revenues that technological and operational scale can be achieved, we expect continued pressure on our operating margins in the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments from increased investment spending in 2018.\nSensitivity of our revenues and earnings to capital market fluctuations\nThe majority of our revenues are based on the value of assets invested in investment products that we manage or administer which are affected by changes in the capital markets. The prevailing capital market conditions during 2017 and 2016 had a net positive impact on our asset-based fees thereby increasing our base revenues. Conversely, the declining capital markets during the second half of 2015 and early first quarter 2016 negatively impacted our asset-based fee revenues and partially offset our revenue growth. Any prolonged future downturns in general capital market conditions could have adverse effects on our revenues and earnings derived from assets under management and administration.\nPage 22 of 80\nEnding Asset Balances\nThis table presents ending asset balances of our clients, or of our clients' customers, for which we provide management or administrative services through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest.

Corporate overhead expenses were $63.8 million, $59.3 million and $54.5 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in corporate overhead expenses in 2017 is primarily due to increased stock-based compensation costs of approximately $2.5 million primarily due to the change in management's estimate of the timing of the achievement of stock option vesting targets and other personnel-related costs. The increase in corporate overhead expenses in 2016 was primarily due to higher salary and other personnel-related costs and expenses associated with ongoing litigation and regulatory activity.\nOther income and expense items\nOther income and expense items on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations consist of:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gain (loss) from investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(456\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and dividend income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(781\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(531\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(483\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of subsidiary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income and expense items, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>132,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes our ownership in LSV.

LSV's average assets under management increased $16.1 billion to $96.7 billion during 2017 as compared to $80.6 billion during 2016, an increase of 20 percent.\nThe decrease in 2016 was primarily due to a reduction in performance fees and increased personnel expenses of LSV. LSV's average assets under management decreased $2.2 billion to $80.6 billion during 2016 as compared to $82.8 billion during 2015, a decrease of three percent.\nIn April 2016, LSV provided an interest in the partnership to select key employees which reduced the ownership percentage of each existing partner on a pro-rata basis. As a result, our total partnership interest in LSV was reduced from approximately 39.2 percent to approximately 38.9 percent.\nGain on sale of subsidiary\nOn July 31, 2012, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our ownership interest in SEI AK and completed the sale on March 28, 2013. We recorded gains from the sale of $2.8 million during 2016 and 2015. The gain recorded in 2016 was the result of the final in a series of three annual payments related to the contingent purchase price we received from the sale. These gains are included in Gain on sale of subsidiary on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 27.4 percent for 2017, 34.3 percent for 2016 and 33.7 percent for 2015. Our effective tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as the U.S. federal tax rates and tax rates in various states and foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income we earned in those jurisdictions. These amounts have been fairly consistent in prior years. Our effective tax rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year.\nPage 29 of 80\nBelow are the most significant recurring and discrete items (See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information): Table 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statutory rate\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign tax expense and tax rate differential\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax benefit from stock option exercises\n</td> <td>(3.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Re-measurement of deferred tax liability\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>One-time transition tax on repatriation of foreign earnings and withholding tax\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development tax credit\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic Production Activities Deduction\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Settlement of state tax petition\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other, net\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in our tax rate for 2017 was primarily due to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the estimated impact from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017. According to ASU 2016-09, we no longer record excess tax benefits from stock option exercises as an increase to additional paid in capital, but record such excess tax benefits as a reduction of income tax expense in the reporting period in which the exercises occur.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and included numerous changes to the current tax law including a permanent reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent, as well as the imposition of a territorial rather than worldwide system which requires a one-time transition tax on the repatriation of previously deferred foreign earnings. Under the Tax Act, the undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries are deemed repatriated. As a result, we determined that a portion of these foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested and therefore accrued foreign withholding taxes.\nThe impact of the Tax Act to our 2017 tax rate was a combination of a $27.1 million benefit from the re-measurement of our estimated net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017 based upon the new corporate tax rate of 21.0 percent offset by the one-time transition tax expense of $11.5 million relating to the estimated impact of the deemed repatriation and withholding taxes of $3.2 million for our previously undistributed foreign earnings for a net tax benefit of $12.4 million. Under the enactment of the Tax Act, the Domestic Production Activities Deduction will no longer be available to us beginning in 2018. We expect our effective tax rate in 2018, exclusive of the impact of stock option exercises, to be approximately 20.0 percent to 22.0 percent. The increase in our tax rate for 2016 was primarily due to lower foreign income in jurisdictions with lower effective rates and the one-time reduction in 2015 due to a favorable settlement of a state tax petition.\nStock-Based Compensation\nDuring 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized approximately $36.4 million, $16.0 million and $17.3 million, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense. All of our stock options have performance-based vesting provisions that tie vesting of the options to our financial performance and do not contain any time-based vesting provisions. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized is based upon an estimate of when the earnings per share targets may be achieved. Any change in our estimate could result in the remaining amount of stock-based compensation expense to be accelerated, spread out over a longer period, or reversed. This may cause volatility in the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and materially affect our earnings.\nDuring 2017, we revised the estimate made as of December 31, 2016 of when certain vesting targets were expected to be achieved. This change in estimate resulted in an increase of $11.2 million in stock-based compensation expense in 2017. The change in our estimate resulted from the higher than expected growth in earnings from the market appreciation of our assets under management and administration and the estimated impact from the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017.\nThere was approximately $62.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee stock options at December 31, 2017 and we expect to recognize approximately $20.1 million in stock-based compensation costs in 2018. These amounts do not reflect any estimate of forfeitures or cancellations in future periods. Actual forfeitures and cancellations occurring in a future period will reduce our stock-based compensation expense.\nPage 30 of 80\nFair Value Measurements\nThe fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, except for the investment funds sponsored by LSV, is determined in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the investment funds sponsored by LSV is measured using the net asset value per share (NAV) as a practical expedient. The fair value of all other financial assets are determined using Level 1 or Level 2 inputs and consist mainly of investments in equity or fixed-income mutual funds that are quoted daily and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and other U.S. government agency securities that are single issuer pools that are valued based on current market data of similar assets. We did not have any financial liabilities at December 31, 2017 or 2016 that were required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis (See Note 5 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information).\nRegulatory Matters\nLike many firms operating within the financial services industry, we are experiencing a difficult regulatory environment across our markets. Our current scale and reach as a provider to the financial services industry, the introduction and implementation of new solutions for our financial services industry clients, the increased regulatory oversight of the financial services industry generally, new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry and ever-changing regulatory interpretations of existing laws and regulations, and a greater propensity of regulators to pursue enforcement actions and other sanctions against regulated entities, have made this an increasingly challenging and costly regulatory environment in which to operate.\nSEI and some of our regulated subsidiaries have undergone or been scheduled to undergo a range of periodic or thematic reviews, examinations or investigations by numerous regulatory authorities around the world, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom (FCA), the Central Bank of Ireland and others. These regulatory activities typically result in the identification of matters or practices to be addressed by us or our subsidiaries and, in certain circumstances, the regulatory authorities require remediation activities or pursue enforcement proceedings against us or our subsidiaries. As described under the caption Regulatory Considerations\u201d in Item 1 of this report, the range of possible sanctions that are available to regulatory authorities include limitations on our ability to engage in business for specified periods of time, the revocation of registration, censures and fines. The direct and indirect costs of responding to these regulatory activities and of complying with new or modified regulations, as well as the potential financial costs and potential reputational impact against us of any enforcement proceedings that might result, is uncertain but could have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial position.\nAcquisition of Archway\nOn July 3, 2017, we acquired Archway, a provider of operating technologies and services to the family office industry, for $81.6 million in cash consideration with up to an additional $8.0 million payable to the seller as a contingent purchase price with respect to two one-year periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2018 depending upon whether Archway achieves specified financial measures during such periods. The results of operations of Archway and any adjustments related to the acquisition are included in the Investment Managers business segment (See Note 16 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>459,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>434,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>407,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(172,302\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,015\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(253,633\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(328,672\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(305,861\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,923\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>695,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>679,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>667,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>695,701\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>679,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash requirements and liquidity needs are primarily funded through our cash flow from operations and our capacity for additional borrowing. At December 31, 2017, our unused sources of liquidity consisted of our cash and cash equivalents and the amount available under our credit facility.\nOur credit facility provides for borrowings of up to $300.0 million and is scheduled to expire in June 2021 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The availability of the credit facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement. The credit facility contains covenants which restrict our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations, asset sales, investments, transactions with affiliates, or to incur liens, as defined in the agreement. In the\nPage 31 of 80\nevent of a default under the credit facility, we would also be restricted from paying dividends on, or repurchasing our common stock. Currently, our ability to borrow from the credit facility is not limited by any covenant of the agreement. In July 2017, we borrowed $40.0 million under the credit facility for the acquisition of Archway (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). We made principal payments of $10.0 million each in the months of October 2017 and January 2018. As of January 31, 2018, the amount of the credit facility available for corporate purposes was $280.0 million.\nThe majority of our excess cash reserves are primarily placed in accounts located in the United States that invest in SEI-sponsored money market mutual funds denominated in the U.S. dollar. We also utilize demand deposit accounts or money market accounts at several well-established financial institutions located in the United States. Accounts used to manage these excess cash reserves do not impose any restrictions or limitations that would prevent us from being able to access such cash amounts immediately. As of January 31, 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents considered free and immediately accessible for other general corporate purposes was $227.9 million.\nOur cash and cash equivalents include accounts managed by our subsidiaries that are used in their operations or to cover specific business and regulatory requirements. The availability of this cash for other purposes beyond the operations of these subsidiaries may be limited. We therefore do not include accounts of our foreign subsidiaries in our calculation of free and immediately accessible cash for other general corporate purposes. With the enactment of the Tax Act, a portion of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are deemed repatriated and we have accrued the estimated one-time transition tax under this legislation in 2017. Any subsequent transfer of available cash related to the repatriated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries could significantly increase our free and immediately accessible cash.\nCash flows from operations increased $25.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily from the increase in our net income, higher distributions payments received from our unconsolidated affiliate, LSV and non-cash items such as the increase in stock-based compensation expense. The increase was partially offset by the net change in our working capital accounts, mainly receivables. The increase in cash flows from operations in 2017 was also partially offset by the retrospective reclassification of excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense. Cash flows from operations increased $26.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily from net change in our working capital accounts, mainly receivables. The increase was partially offset by lower distribution payments received from LSV.\nNet cash used in investing activities includes:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Critical Accounting Policies\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. We believe that the following accounting policies require extensive judgment by our management to determine the recognition and timing of amounts recorded in our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition:\nRevenues are recognized in the periods in which the related services are performed provided that persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Cash received by us in advance of the performance of services is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned. Our principal sources of revenues are: (1) asset management, administration and distribution fees calculated as a percentage of the total average daily net assets under management or administration; (2) information processing and software servicing fees that are either recurring and primarily earned based upon the number of trust accounts being serviced or a percentage of the total average daily market value of our clients' assets processed on our platforms, or non-recurring and based upon project-oriented contractual agreements related to client implementations; and (3) transaction-based fees for providing trade-execution services.\nOur revenues are based on contractual arrangements. Certain portions of our revenues require management's consideration of the nature of the client relationship in determining whether to recognize as revenue the gross amount billed or net amount retained after payments are made to vendors for certain services related to the product or service offering. For the majority of our services, we are the primary obligor responsible for fulfilling the performance obligations of the contract. In addition, we retain full discretion in establishing the price charged to the customer, control the nature, type, characteristics or specifications of the performance obligations identified in the contract, and assume all credit risk associated with the client. Based on the foregoing, fees received from our clients for these services are recorded as gross revenues and vendor costs are recorded as gross expenses. However, we are also party to certain arrangements whereby we are not the primary obligor responsible for fulfilling the performance obligations of the contract. Fees received for those arrangements are reported net of costs associated with the provision of those services.\nComputer Software Development Costs:\nWe utilize internally developed computer software as part of our product offerings. In the development of a new software product, substantial consideration must be given by management to determine whether costs incurred are research and development costs, or internal software development costs eligible for capitalization. Management must consider a number of different factors during their evaluation of each computer software development project that includes estimates and assumptions. Costs considered to be research and development are expensed as incurred. After meeting specific requirements, internal software development costs are capitalized as incurred. The capitalization and ongoing assessment of recoverability of software development costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors, including, but not limited to, technological and economic feasibility, and estimated economic life. Amortization of capitalized software development costs begins when the product is ready for its intended use. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a project basis using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product or enhancement.\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our capitalized software when circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The review of capitalized software for impairment requires significant assumptions about operating strategies, underlying technologies utilized, and external market factors. Our capitalized software was developed using mainstream technologies that are industry standards and are based on technology developed by multiple vendors that are significant industry leaders. External market factors include, but are not limited to, expected levels of competition, barriers to entry by potential competitors, stability in the target market and governmental regulations.\nPage 34 of 80\nIncome Tax Accounting:\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. Although we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income, such as income from operations or capital gains income. Actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nStock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as various other assumptions. These assumptions include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We account for forfeitures as they occur. The amount of stock-based compensation expense that is recognized in a given period is dependent upon management's estimate of when the earnings per share targets are expected to be achieved. If this estimate proves to be inaccurate, the remaining amount of stock-based compensation expense could be accelerated, spread out over a longer period, or reversed. We currently base our expectations for these assumptions from historical data and other applicable factors. These expectations are subject to change in future periods.\nThe assessment of critical accounting policies is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that can occur from the application of the full range of our accounting policies. Materially different financial results could occur in the application of other accounting policies as well. Also, materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards.", "summary": "The report discusses the company's financial performance, including revenues, expenses, income from operations, and net income for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(In thousands, except share and per-share data)\nThis discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated financial condition at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, and other factors that may affect future financial performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 of this Annual Report and the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nCertain information contained in this discussion is or may be considered forward-looking. Forward-looking statements relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that involve certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change. Although we believe our assumptions are reasonable, they could be inaccurate. Our actual future revenues and income could differ materially from our expected results. We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nConsolidated Summary\nWe are a leading global provider of investment processing, investment management and investment operations platforms. We help corporations, financial institutions, financial advisors and ultra-high-net-worth families create and manage wealth by providing comprehensive, innovative, investment and investment-business platforms. Investment processing fees are earned as monthly fees for contracted services, including computer processing services, software licenses and investment operations services, as well as transaction-based fees for providing securities valuation and trade-execution. Investment operations and investment management fees are earned as a percentage of average assets under management, administration or advised assets. As of December 31, 2017, through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest, we manage, advise or administer $860.6 billion in hedge, private equity, mutual fund and pooled or separately managed assets, including $337.3 billion in assets under management and $518.4 billion in client assets under administration. Our affiliate, LSV Asset Management (LSV), manages $105.3 billion of assets which are included as assets under management.\nOur Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended 2017, 2016 and 2015 were:\n\n* Variances noted \"NM\" indicate the percent change is not meaningful.\nSignificant Items Impacting Our Financial Results in 2017\nRevenues increased $125.0 million, or nine percent, to $1.5 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net income increased $70.6 million, or 21 percent, to $404.4 million and diluted earnings per share increased to $2.49 per share in 2017 compared to $2.03 per share in 2016. We believe the following items were significant to our business results during 2017:\n \u2022 Revenue growth was primarily driven by higher Asset management, administration and distribution fees from market appreciation and positive cash flows from new and existing clients. Our average assets under management, excluding LSV, increased $24.2 billion, or 13 percent, to $214.1 billion during 2017 as compared to $189.9 billion during 2016. Our average assets under administration increased $57.7 billion, or 13 percent, to $497.6 billion during 2017 as compared to $439.9 billion during 2016. \nPage 19 of 80\n \u2022 Information processing and software servicing fees in our Private Banks segment increased $16.6 million in 2017 primarily due to increased assets from new and existing clients processed on the SEI Wealth Platform and increased non-recurring professional services fees. \n \u2022 Our proportionate share in the earnings of LSV was $152.6 million in 2017 as compared to $126.1 million in 2016, an increase of 21 percent. The increase was primarily due to increased assets under management from LSV's existing clients due to market appreciation and increased performance fees associated with their investment products. \n \u2022 We capitalized $51.4 million in 2017 for the SEI Wealth Platform as compared to $39.8 million in 2016. Amortization expense related to the Platform increased to $46.5 million during 2017 as compared to $45.0 million during 2016 due to continued development. We adjusted the remaining useful life of certain components and functionality of the Platform effective October 1, 2017 (See the caption \"SEI Wealth Platform - Recent Developments\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 As we continue the development of new elements of the Platform, our expenses related to maintenance, enhancements and support have increased. These costs are primarily recognized in personnel and consulting costs and are expensed as incurred. These increased costs primarily impacted the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. \n \u2022 We also capitalized $9.7 million in 2017 as compared to $10.6 million in 2016 for new technological capabilities for the Investment Managers segment. This new offering includes components that leverage upon the current infrastructure and add significant enhancements designed to aggregate, transact and process data. We expect this new technology will be placed into service during the first quarter of 2018 with an estimated useful life of five to seven years. \n \u2022 We recognized a $3.4 million performance fee and a corresponding $1.7 million sub-advisory expense associated with an SEI-sponsored investment product during the fourth quarter 2017. These items resulted in a positive net impact of approximately $0.01 diluted earnings per share and were reflected in the Institutional Investors segment. \n \u2022 Our operating expenses, primarily personnel costs, in our Investment Advisors and Investment Managers segments increased. These expenses primarily consist of operational, technology and marketing costs and are mainly related to servicing existing clients and acquiring new clients. These operating expenses are included in Compensation, benefits and other personnel costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation expense increased by $20.3 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to a change in our estimate of the timing of when stock option vesting targets will be achieved and stock options awards granted in late 2016 (See the caption \"Stock-Based Compensation\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 The direct costs associated with our investment management programs increased in our Private Banks, Investment Advisors and Institutional Investors segments. These costs primarily relate to fees charged by investment advisory firms for day-to-day portfolio management of SEI-sponsored investment products. These costs are included in Sub-advisory, distribution and other asset management costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate during 2017 was 27.4 percent as compared to 34.3 percent during 2016. Our effective tax rate for 2017 reflects the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) and includes a tax benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our estimated net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, partially offset by a one-time transition tax relating to the estimated tax impact of the deemed repatriation and withholding tax of our previously undistributed foreign earnings. Our 2017 tax rate was also positively impacted by the adoption of a new accounting standard which requires all excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense to be recorded as an income tax benefit in the income statement (See the caption \"Income Taxes\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 On July 3, 2017, we acquired Archway Technology Partners, LLC (Archway), a provider of operating technologies and services to the family office industry, for $81.6 million in cash consideration. We borrowed $40.0 million under our credit facility to fund this acquisition and made principal payments of $10.0 million each in October 2017 and January 2018. The results of operations of Archway are included in our Investment Managers business segment (See Notes 7 and 16 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n \u2022 We continued our stock repurchase program during 2017 and purchased approximately 4,403,000 shares at an average price of $56.36 per share for a total cost of $248.1 million.  Significant Items Impacting Our Financial Results in 2016\nRevenues increased $67.3 million, or five percent, to $1.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. Net income increased $2.2 million, or one percent, to $333.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased to $2.03 per share in 2016 compared to $1.96 per share in 2015. We believe the following items were significant to our business results during 2016:\n \u2022 Revenue growth was primarily driven by higher Asset management, administration and distribution fees from improved cash flows from new and existing clients and market appreciation. Our average assets under management, \nPage 20 of 80\nexcluding LSV, increased $13.4 billion, or eight percent, to $189.9 billion during 2016 as compared to $176.5 billion during 2015. Our average assets under administration increased $43.3 billion, or 11 percent, to $439.9 billion during 2016 as compared to $396.6 billion during 2015.\n \u2022 We recognized a $12.3 million performance fee and a corresponding $6.1 million sub-advisory expense associated with an SEI-sponsored investment product during the fourth quarter 2016. These items resulted in a positive net impact of approximately $0.03 diluted earnings per share and were reflected in the Institutional Investors segment. \n \u2022 Information processing and software servicing fees in our Private Banks segment increased $9.3 million in 2016 primarily due to increased assets from new and existing clients processed on the SEI Wealth Platform and increased non-recurring professional services fees. \n \u2022 Our proportionate share in the earnings of LSV was $126.1 million in 2016 as compared to $138.4 million in 2015, a decrease of nine percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower performance fees and increased personnel expenses of LSV. \n \u2022 The direct costs associated with our investment management programs increased in our Private Banks, Investment Advisors and Institutional Investors segments. These costs primarily relate to fees charged by investment advisory firms for day-to-day portfolio management of SEI-sponsored investment products and include the $6.1 million sub-advisory expense associated with performance fees mentioned previously. These costs are included in Sub-advisory, distribution and other asset management costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 We capitalized $50.4 million and $29.4 million in software development costs in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $39.8 million in 2016 and $24.5 million in 2015 directly relate to the SEI Wealth Platform. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $45.0 million during 2016 as compared to $42.4 million during 2015 due to continued enhancements to the Platform. \n \u2022 As we continue the development of new elements of the Platform, our expenses related to maintenance, enhancements and support have increased. These costs are primarily recognized in personnel and consulting costs and are expensed as incurred. These increased costs primarily impacted the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. We expect these costs to continue to increase into 2017. \n \u2022 We progressed in the development phase of a new application for the Investment Managers segment and capitalized $10.6 million in software development costs in 2016. This new offering includes components that leverage upon the current infrastructure and add significant enhancements designed to aggregate, transact and process data. \n \u2022 Our operating expenses, primarily personnel costs, in our Investment Advisors and Investment Managers segments increased. These expenses primarily consist of operational and marketing costs and are mainly related to servicing existing clients and acquiring new clients. These operating expenses are included in Compensation, benefits and other personnel costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound during 2016 negatively impacted our revenues and operating income of our Private Banks and Institutional Investors segments. A prolonged period of a strengthening U.S. dollar against the British pound could have a further negative impact to our revenues and operating profits of these segments. \n \u2022 We recorded our final pre-tax gain of $2.8 million, or $0.01 diluted earnings per share, in 2016 from the sale of SEI Asset Korea (SEI AK) which was completed during the first quarter 2013. This gain was the result of the third in a series of three annual payments related to the contingent purchase price we received from the sale. The gain from the sale is included in Gain on sale of subsidiary on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate was 34.3 percent in 2016 as compared to 33.7 percent in 2015. Our tax rate in 2015 benefited from a favorable settlement of a tax petition filed with the State of Pennsylvania (See the caption \"Income Taxes\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 We continued our stock repurchase program during 2016 and purchased approximately 6,600,000 shares at an average price of $44.60 per share for a total cost of $294.4 million.  SEI Wealth Platform - Recent Developments\nThe SEI Wealth Platform combines business service processing with asset management distribution services and operates as an integral business platform for the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. The capabilities of the Platform have and continue to expand the services we offer to large global financial institutions, investment advisors, and other similar institutions and provide us the opportunity to enter into new markets.\nThe SEI Wealth Platform has primarily been offered under the Platform as a Service (PaaS) business model. The SEI Wealth Platform (PaaS) model includes client acquisition, portfolio management, enrollment and a unified product catalog that contains a single location for all of the client's investment products used to construct model portfolios as well as enabling\nPage 21 of 80\nthe Investment Advisors business segment to enter into the flexible turn-key asset management platform (TAMP) market by providing clients with access to third-party funds, ETFs, equities, fixed-income and alternative investments into portfolios that are not currently available.\nOur recent development efforts include offering the SEI Wealth Platform through a Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery mode to serve different types of clients in the wealth management marketplace. The SEI Wealth Platform (SaaS) business model will target the large bank marketplace and is expected to create significant revenue and cash flow opportunity. We believe both business models have received market acceptance as evidenced by the signing of Wells Fargo Bank (Wells Fargo) for the SaaS model and the installation of Regions Bank (Regions) for the PaaS model.\nThe technical and business validation of the configuration and data migration for the conversion of the entire Wells Fargo wealth management business under the Saas model is currently in progress and meeting expectations. In early October 2017, Regions began operating on the Platform in a live environment and we completed our largest conversion of Investment Advisors segment clients to date.\nThe Platform provides an enabling technology infrastructure for our businesses and clients for the future and was built using mainstream technologies using market-leading vendors. It is our expectation that the operating system, the database operating platform and the software programming language which comprise the underlying architecture will allow it to adapt to both market changes and technology changes over time. We believe the breadth of the services offered through the Platform provide us an advantage over our competitors. These services are core functions to the global financial services industry regardless of current market conditions. The global financial services industry is highly regulated and demand for the capabilities of the Platform is only expected to increase.\nThe initial version of the Platform was placed into service in July 2007 with an estimated useful life of 15 years. All significant enhancements to the Platform were originally being amortized over the remaining useful life and would have been fully expensed by June 2022. As a result of these recent developments, we adjusted the remaining useful life of certain components and functionality of the Platform effective October 1, 2017. After the adjustment of these components and as of December 31, 2017, the Platform has a weighted average remaining life of 8.2 years. Based upon our assessment, we estimate amortization expense related to components and functionality of the Platform currently in use as of December 31, 2017 will be approximately $9.7 million during the first quarter 2018. This estimate does not include our software development costs in-progress associated with future releases of the Platform of $38.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The release date for these capitalized software development costs in-progress has not yet been determined.\nAdditionally, future enhancements to the Platform may replace significant existing components or functionality. Once new enhancements are completed and ready to be placed into service, existing components or functionality that are being replaced may be abandoned. If this occurs, the remaining net book value of the previously capitalized software development costs related to the Platform will be expensed over the remaining useful life of those components or written off.\nAs we progress through the different stages of deployment of the Platform to a broader market, we expect to encounter numerous challenges; however, the Platform promises to provide a significant opportunity to expand our services into new markets that will increase revenues and profits in the long term. Until we attain a level of revenues that technological and operational scale can be achieved, we expect continued pressure on our operating margins in the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments from increased investment spending in 2018.\nSensitivity of our revenues and earnings to capital market fluctuations\nThe majority of our revenues are based on the value of assets invested in investment products that we manage or administer which are affected by changes in the capital markets. The prevailing capital market conditions during 2017 and 2016 had a net positive impact on our asset-based fees thereby increasing our base revenues. Conversely, the declining capital markets during the second half of 2015 and early first quarter 2016 negatively impacted our asset-based fee revenues and partially offset our revenue growth. Any prolonged future downturns in general capital market conditions could have adverse effects on our revenues and earnings derived from assets under management and administration.\nPage 22 of 80\nEnding Asset Balances\nThis table presents ending asset balances of our clients, or of our clients' customers, for which we provide management or administrative services through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest. \nPage 23 of 80\nAverage Asset Balances\nThis table presents average asset balances of our clients, or of our clients' customers, for which we provide management or administrative services through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest.

Amortization expense related to the Platform increased to $46.5 million during 2017 as compared to $45.0 million during 2016 due to continued development. We adjusted the remaining useful life of certain components and functionality of the Platform effective October 1, 2017 (See the caption \"SEI Wealth Platform - Recent Developments\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 As we continue the development of new elements of the Platform, our expenses related to maintenance, enhancements and support have increased. These costs are primarily recognized in personnel and consulting costs and are expensed as incurred. These increased costs primarily impacted the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. \n \u2022 We also capitalized $9.7 million in 2017 as compared to $10.6 million in 2016 for new technological capabilities for the Investment Managers segment. This new offering includes components that leverage upon the current infrastructure and add significant enhancements designed to aggregate, transact and process data. We expect this new technology will be placed into service during the first quarter of 2018 with an estimated useful life of five to seven years. \n \u2022 We recognized a $3.4 million performance fee and a corresponding $1.7 million sub-advisory expense associated with an SEI-sponsored investment product during the fourth quarter 2017. These items resulted in a positive net impact of approximately $0.01 diluted earnings per share and were reflected in the Institutional Investors segment. \n \u2022 Our operating expenses, primarily personnel costs, in our Investment Advisors and Investment Managers segments increased. These expenses primarily consist of operational, technology and marketing costs and are mainly related to servicing existing clients and acquiring new clients. These operating expenses are included in Compensation, benefits and other personnel costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation expense increased by $20.3 million during 2017 as compared to 2016 due to a change in our estimate of the timing of when stock option vesting targets will be achieved and stock options awards granted in late 2016 (See the caption \"Stock-Based Compensation\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 The direct costs associated with our investment management programs increased in our Private Banks, Investment Advisors and Institutional Investors segments. These costs primarily relate to fees charged by investment advisory firms for day-to-day portfolio management of SEI-sponsored investment products. These costs are included in Sub-advisory, distribution and other asset management costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate during 2017 was 27.4 percent as compared to 34.3 percent during 2016. Our effective tax rate for 2017 reflects the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) and includes a tax benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our estimated net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, partially offset by a one-time transition tax relating to the estimated tax impact of the deemed repatriation and withholding tax of our previously undistributed foreign earnings. Our 2017 tax rate was also positively impacted by the adoption of a new accounting standard which requires all excess tax benefits recognized on stock-based compensation expense to be recorded as an income tax benefit in the income statement (See the caption \"Income Taxes\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 On July 3, 2017, we acquired Archway Technology Partners, LLC (Archway), a provider of operating technologies and services to the family office industry, for $81.6 million in cash consideration. We borrowed $40.0 million under our credit facility to fund this acquisition and made principal payments of $10.0 million each in October 2017 and January 2018. The results of operations of Archway are included in our Investment Managers business segment (See Notes 7 and 16 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \n \u2022 We continued our stock repurchase program during 2017 and purchased approximately 4,403,000 shares at an average price of $56.36 per share for a total cost of $248.1 million.  Significant Items Impacting Our Financial Results in 2016\nRevenues increased $67.3 million, or five percent, to $1.4 billion in 2016 compared to 2015. Net income increased $2.2 million, or one percent, to $333.8 million and diluted earnings per share increased to $2.03 per share in 2016 compared to $1.96 per share in 2015. We believe the following items were significant to our business results during 2016:\n \u2022 Revenue growth was primarily driven by higher Asset management, administration and distribution fees from improved cash flows from new and existing clients and market appreciation. Our average assets under management, \nPage 20 of 80\nexcluding LSV, increased $13.4 billion, or eight percent, to $189.9 billion during 2016 as compared to $176.5 billion during 2015. Our average assets under administration increased $43.3 billion, or 11 percent, to $439.9 billion during 2016 as compared to $396.6 billion during 2015.\n \u2022 We recognized a $12.3 million performance fee and a corresponding $6.1 million sub-advisory expense associated with an SEI-sponsored investment product during the fourth quarter 2016. These items resulted in a positive net impact of approximately $0.03 diluted earnings per share and were reflected in the Institutional Investors segment. \n \u2022 Information processing and software servicing fees in our Private Banks segment increased $9.3 million in 2016 primarily due to increased assets from new and existing clients processed on the SEI Wealth Platform and increased non-recurring professional services fees. \n \u2022 Our proportionate share in the earnings of LSV was $126.1 million in 2016 as compared to $138.4 million in 2015, a decrease of nine percent. The decrease was primarily due to lower performance fees and increased personnel expenses of LSV. \n \u2022 The direct costs associated with our investment management programs increased in our Private Banks, Investment Advisors and Institutional Investors segments. These costs primarily relate to fees charged by investment advisory firms for day-to-day portfolio management of SEI-sponsored investment products and include the $6.1 million sub-advisory expense associated with performance fees mentioned previously. These costs are included in Sub-advisory, distribution and other asset management costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 We capitalized $50.4 million and $29.4 million in software development costs in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Of these amounts, $39.8 million in 2016 and $24.5 million in 2015 directly relate to the SEI Wealth Platform. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $45.0 million during 2016 as compared to $42.4 million during 2015 due to continued enhancements to the Platform. \n \u2022 As we continue the development of new elements of the Platform, our expenses related to maintenance, enhancements and support have increased. These costs are primarily recognized in personnel and consulting costs and are expensed as incurred. These increased costs primarily impacted the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. We expect these costs to continue to increase into 2017. \n \u2022 We progressed in the development phase of a new application for the Investment Managers segment and capitalized $10.6 million in software development costs in 2016. This new offering includes components that leverage upon the current infrastructure and add significant enhancements designed to aggregate, transact and process data. \n \u2022 Our operating expenses, primarily personnel costs, in our Investment Advisors and Investment Managers segments increased. These expenses primarily consist of operational and marketing costs and are mainly related to servicing existing clients and acquiring new clients. These operating expenses are included in Compensation, benefits and other personnel costs on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n \u2022 The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound during 2016 negatively impacted our revenues and operating income of our Private Banks and Institutional Investors segments. A prolonged period of a strengthening U.S. dollar against the British pound could have a further negative impact to our revenues and operating profits of these segments. \n \u2022 We recorded our final pre-tax gain of $2.8 million, or $0.01 diluted earnings per share, in 2016 from the sale of SEI Asset Korea (SEI AK) which was completed during the first quarter 2013. This gain was the result of the third in a series of three annual payments related to the contingent purchase price we received from the sale. The gain from the sale is included in Gain on sale of subsidiary on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations (See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information). \n \u2022 Our effective tax rate was 34.3 percent in 2016 as compared to 33.7 percent in 2015. Our tax rate in 2015 benefited from a favorable settlement of a tax petition filed with the State of Pennsylvania (See the caption \"Income Taxes\" later in this discussion for more information). \n \u2022 We continued our stock repurchase program during 2016 and purchased approximately 6,600,000 shares at an average price of $44.60 per share for a total cost of $294.4 million.  SEI Wealth Platform - Recent Developments\nThe SEI Wealth Platform combines business service processing with asset management distribution services and operates as an integral business platform for the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments. The capabilities of the Platform have and continue to expand the services we offer to large global financial institutions, investment advisors, and other similar institutions and provide us the opportunity to enter into new markets.\nThe SEI Wealth Platform has primarily been offered under the Platform as a Service (PaaS) business model. The SEI Wealth Platform (PaaS) model includes client acquisition, portfolio management, enrollment and a unified product catalog that contains a single location for all of the client's investment products used to construct model portfolios as well as enabling\nPage 21 of 80\nthe Investment Advisors business segment to enter into the flexible turn-key asset management platform (TAMP) market by providing clients with access to third-party funds, ETFs, equities, fixed-income and alternative investments into portfolios that are not currently available.\nOur recent development efforts include offering the SEI Wealth Platform through a Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery mode to serve different types of clients in the wealth management marketplace. The SEI Wealth Platform (SaaS) business model will target the large bank marketplace and is expected to create significant revenue and cash flow opportunity. We believe both business models have received market acceptance as evidenced by the signing of Wells Fargo Bank (Wells Fargo) for the SaaS model and the installation of Regions Bank (Regions) for the PaaS model.\nThe technical and business validation of the configuration and data migration for the conversion of the entire Wells Fargo wealth management business under the Saas model is currently in progress and meeting expectations. In early October 2017, Regions began operating on the Platform in a live environment and we completed our largest conversion of Investment Advisors segment clients to date.\nThe Platform provides an enabling technology infrastructure for our businesses and clients for the future and was built using mainstream technologies using market-leading vendors. It is our expectation that the operating system, the database operating platform and the software programming language which comprise the underlying architecture will allow it to adapt to both market changes and technology changes over time. We believe the breadth of the services offered through the Platform provide us an advantage over our competitors. These services are core functions to the global financial services industry regardless of current market conditions. The global financial services industry is highly regulated and demand for the capabilities of the Platform is only expected to increase.\nThe initial version of the Platform was placed into service in July 2007 with an estimated useful life of 15 years. All significant enhancements to the Platform were originally being amortized over the remaining useful life and would have been fully expensed by June 2022. As a result of these recent developments, we adjusted the remaining useful life of certain components and functionality of the Platform effective October 1, 2017. After the adjustment of these components and as of December 31, 2017, the Platform has a weighted average remaining life of 8.2 years. Based upon our assessment, we estimate amortization expense related to components and functionality of the Platform currently in use as of December 31, 2017 will be approximately $9.7 million during the first quarter 2018. This estimate does not include our software development costs in-progress associated with future releases of the Platform of $38.1 million as of December 31, 2017. The release date for these capitalized software development costs in-progress has not yet been determined.\nAdditionally, future enhancements to the Platform may replace significant existing components or functionality. Once new enhancements are completed and ready to be placed into service, existing components or functionality that are being replaced may be abandoned. If this occurs, the remaining net book value of the previously capitalized software development costs related to the Platform will be expensed over the remaining useful life of those components or written off.\nAs we progress through the different stages of deployment of the Platform to a broader market, we expect to encounter numerous challenges; however, the Platform promises to provide a significant opportunity to expand our services into new markets that will increase revenues and profits in the long term. Until we attain a level of revenues that technological and operational scale can be achieved, we expect continued pressure on our operating margins in the Private Banks and Investment Advisors business segments from increased investment spending in 2018.\nSensitivity of our revenues and earnings to capital market fluctuations\nThe majority of our revenues are based on the value of assets invested in investment products that we manage or administer which are affected by changes in the capital markets. The prevailing capital market conditions during 2017 and 2016 had a net positive impact on our asset-based fees thereby increasing our base revenues. Conversely, the declining capital markets during the second half of 2015 and early first quarter 2016 negatively impacted our asset-based fee revenues and partially offset our revenue growth. Any prolonged future downturns in general capital market conditions could have adverse effects on our revenues and earnings derived from assets under management and administration.\nPage 22 of 80\nEnding Asset Balances\nThis table presents ending asset balances of our clients, or of our clients' customers, for which we provide management or administrative services through our subsidiaries and partnerships in which we have a significant interest.
