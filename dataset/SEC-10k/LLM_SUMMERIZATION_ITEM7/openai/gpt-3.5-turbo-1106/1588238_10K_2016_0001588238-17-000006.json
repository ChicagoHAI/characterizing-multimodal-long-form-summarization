Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview of Our Business\nRice Energy is an independent natural gas and oil company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGL properties in the Appalachian Basin. As a result of changes to our operations and organizational structure in 2016, we now manage our business in three operating segments - the Exploration and Production segment, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment. These segments are managed separately due to their distinct operational differences. The Exploration and Production segment is responsible for the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGLs. The Rice Midstream Holdings segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production for us and third parties in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio. The Rice Midstream Partners segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and in the provision of water services to support the well completion services of us and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio.\nAs a result of certain reorganizations and transactions that occurred during 2014, 2015 and 2016, our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented in this Annual Report may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward. For example, information for the period from January 1, 2014 until January 29, 2014, as contained within the year ended December 31, 2014 pertains to the historical financial statements and results of operations of Rice Drilling B LLC, our accounting predecessor. Such periods reflect only our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture. From and after our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest from Alpha Holdings on January 29, 2014, the results of operations of our Marcellus joint venture are consolidated into our results of operations.\nIn connection with the RMP IPO in December 2014, we contributed to RMP all of our gas gathering and compression assets in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania in exchange for, among other things, common and subordinated units representing a 50% limited partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in RMP. Indirectly, through Midstream Holdings, we own and control the general partner of RMP, and, as such, the results of operations of RMP are consolidated into our results of operations. However, while our results of operations consolidate the results of operations of RMP for periods subsequent to December 22, 2014, they give effect to the noncontrolling interest in RMP held by its public unitholders.\nAlso in connection with the RMP IPO, we entered into various gas gathering and compression agreements and water distribution services agreements, both intercompany and, in the case of certain gas gathering and compression services in Pennsylvania, with RMP. Prior to December 22, 2014, with certain limited exceptions, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment did not charge fees for providing such services to our Exploration and Production segment. From December 22, 2014 through October 31, 2015, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment charged the Exploration and Production segment water services fees according to the water services agreements entered into in connection with the RMP IPO. Beginning on November 1, 2015, as a result of the closing of the acquisition of PA Water and OH Water by RMP, the Rice Midstream Partners segment charges the Exploration and Production segment water services fees according to certain water services agreements entered in connection with the acquisition. These gathering and water services fees are eliminated through consolidation.\nFollowing completion of the Vantage Acquisition, we operate Vantage through Rice Energy Operating. As part of the consideration for the Vantage Acquisition, the Vantage Sellers were issued common units in Rice Energy Operating. In connection with the issuance of such membership interests to the Vantage Sellers, us and the Vantage Sellers entered into the Third A&R LLC Agreement. Under the Third A&R LLC Agreement, we control all of the day-to-day business affairs and decision making of Rice Energy Operating without approval of any other member, unless otherwise stated in the Third A&R LLC Agreement. As such, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Rice Energy Operating and the day-to-day management of Rice Energy Operating's business. Pursuant to the terms of the Third A&R LLC Agreement, we cannot, under any circumstances, be removed or replaced as the sole manager of Rice Energy Operating, except by our own election so long as it remains a member of Rice Energy Operating.\nSources of Revenues\nThe substantial majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of natural gas and do not include the effects of derivatives. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in realized prices. Our gathering, compression and water services revenues are primarily derived from our gathering and compression contracts in addition to fees charged to outside working interest owners.\nThe following table provides detail of our operating revenues from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil and NGL sales\n</td> <td>6,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering, compression and water services\n</td> <td>101,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>24,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices are widely-used benchmarks in the pricing of natural gas.

The remainder of the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects 100% of the volumes sold by our Marcellus joint venture.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We sell a substantial majority of our production to two natural gas marketers, Sequent and BP. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to Sequent and BP represented 25% and 24% of our total sales, respectively. If our natural gas marketers decided to stop purchasing natural gas from us, our revenues could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Although a substantial portion of production is purchased by these customers, we do not believe the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, as other customers or markets would be accessible to us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our Exploration and Production segment accounted for 87% of our operating revenues. While we anticipate that the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our operating revenues in future periods, we expect that a substantial majority of our operating revenues will remain attributable to our Exploration and Production segment.\nPrincipal Components of Our Cost Structure\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lease operating expense. These are the day to day operating costs incurred to maintain production of our natural gas producing wells.

These are costs incurred to bring natural gas to the market. Such costs include fees paid to third parties who operate low- and high-pressure gathering systems that transport our natural gas. We often enter into firm transportation contracts that secure takeaway capacity that includes minimum volume commitments, the cost for which is included in these expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Midstream operation and maintenance. These are costs incurred to operate and maintain our low- and high-pressure natural gas gathering and compression systems and our water services assets used to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Incentive unit expense. These costs represent non-cash compensation expense for incentive units awarded to certain of our employees by NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings. In connection with our IPO and related corporate reorganization, the holders of incentive units in REO contributed a portion of their incentive units to Rice Holdings and NGP Holdings in return for substantially similar incentive units in such entities. This resulted in the incentive units being deemed to have been modified, and the performance conditions were considered to be probable of occurring. Therefore, their fair values were measured and compensation expense from the date of initial grant through December 31, 2016 has been recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016. The payment obligation as it relates to the incentive units resides with NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings and has not been, and will not be borne by us. In April 2016, NGP Holdings settled its remaining incentive unit obligation in connection with our April 2016 Equity Offering. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General and administrative expense. These costs include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our exploration and production operations, midstream operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance expenses. General and administrative expense also includes stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted under our long-term incentive plan.

Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas. As a successful efforts\u201d company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units of production method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Interest expense. We have financed a portion of our working capital requirements and property acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our Notes. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by the level of drilling, completion and acquisition activities, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We will likely continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow. To date, we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gain on derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas.

The commodity derivative contracts we have in place are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, these commodity derivative contracts are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss in our results of operations. Cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Income tax expense. We are a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, subject to federal income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% of pretax earnings. The reorganization of our business into a corporation in connection with the closing of our IPO required the recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for the initial temporary differences at the time of our IPO. The resulting deferred tax liability of approximately $162.3 million was recorded in equity at the date of our IPO. Based on our deductions primarily related to intangible drilling costs ( IDCs\u201d), we could potentially generate significant net operating loss assets and deferred tax liabilities. We may report and pay state income or franchise taxes in periods where our IDC deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income or franchise taxes are determined on another basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nIn evaluating our financial results, we focus on production, revenues, per unit cash production costs and general and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses. We also evaluate our rates of return on invested capital in our wells, and we measure the expected return of our wells based on EUR and the related costs of acquisition, development and production.\nWe believe the quality of our assets combined with our technical and managerial expertise can generate attractive rates of return as we develop our core acreage position in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Additionally, by focusing on concentrated acreage positions, we can build and own centralized midstream infrastructure, including low- and high-pressure gathering lines, compression facilities and water pipeline systems, which enable us to reduce reliance on third-party operators, minimize costs and increase our returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nBelow are some highlights of our

31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTotal operating revenues. The $276.8 million increase in total operating revenues was mainly a result of a 51% increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production from 201.3 Bcfe in 2015 to 304.4 Bcfe in 2016. During 2016, we turned 70 gross (63 net) wells into sales, of which 14 gross (14 net) wells were acquired in the Vantage Acquisition. The increase in operating revenues was slightly offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price in 2016 was $2.14 per Mcf compared to $2.21 per Mcf in 2015, in each case before the effect of hedges. Operating revenues were also positively impacted by a $51.9 million, or 105%, increase in gathering, compression and water service revenues year-over-year. This increase primarily relates to an increase in third-party volumes and revenues on our gathering contracts. In addition, post-acquisition revenue associated with the Vantage Acquisition was $51.6 million for the period from October 19, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nLease operating expenses. The $6.2 million increase in lease operating expenses was attributable to an increase in our production base in 2016 as compared to the prior year. However, on a per unit basis, lease operating expenses decreased from $0.22 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.17 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease on a per unit basis was attributable to improved efficiencies, primarily relating to production water recycling and reduced flowback periods.\nGathering, compression and transportation. Gathering, compression and transportation expense for 2016 of $123.9 million was mainly comprised of $105.1 million of transportation contracts with third parties and $19.3 million of gathering charges from third parties. The $39.1 million, or 46%, increase in expense was primarily attributable to a 51% increase in production volumes, as well as increased firm transportation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExploration. The increase in exploration expense year over year of $12.0 million was primarily due to leasehold write-offs, mainly associated with expired leaseholds.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. The $6.2 million increase in midstream operation and maintenance expense in 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to on and off pad water transfer costs and water procurement, in addition to increased expenses following the Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition primarily associated with water transfer and pipeline maintenance costs. On a per unit basis, midstream operation and maintenance expense was $0.08 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense increased $15.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. In 2016, the $51.8 million expense consisted of $24.5 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $27.3 million of compensation expense related to a cumulative adjustment to equal the cumulative cash payment made by NGP Holdings to NGP Holdings incentive unitholders. In 2015, the $36.1 million expense consisted of $33.7 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $26.7 million related to payments made to certain holders of NGP Holdings incentive units, offset by $24.3 million of non-cash income related to the fair market value adjustment for the NGP Holdings incentive units which was largely driven by the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2015. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units as a result of the April 2016 settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. See Item 1. Financial Statements-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-14. Incentive Units\u201d for additional information.\nImpairment of gas properties. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $20.9 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in impairment expense related to our gas properties. In 2016, we recognized $20.9 million of impairment expense in the consolidated statement of operations related to lease expirations on non-core assets. In 2015, we determined that the carrying value of our Upper Devonian proved property was not fully recoverable and as a result, we recognized a $10.9 million impairment expense to write-down such proved properties to fair value. In addition, we recognized $7.3 million of impairment expense in 2015 due to changes in our development plans and lease expirations.\nImpairment of goodwill. The $294.9 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 related to a full impairment of goodwill associated with our Exploration and Production segment. In performing the annual goodwill impairment analysis, management considered the negative industry and market trends, including the decline in commodity prices and overall market performance of our peers and ourselves, to be the primary reasons of impairment.\nImpairment of fixed assets. The $23.1 million impairment expense in 2016 was primarily related to a $20.3 million impairment for pipeline assets that were decommissioned.\nGeneral and administrative expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, general and administrative expense (before stock compensation expense) increased $10.3 million, or 12%, primarily due to the additions of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. At December 31, 2016, we had 467 employees, a 26% increase compared to December 31, 2015. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased year-over-year due to an increase in rent expense primarily related to our office leases. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expense (before stock compensation expense)\ndecreased by 26%, from $0.43 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.32 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a 51% increase in production. Slightly offsetting the increase in general and administrative expenses was an increase in allocated employee time to capital projects due to increased production.\nIncluded in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of $21.3 million and $16.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to increased compensation expense associated with restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards. Please see Note 16-Stock-Based Compensation\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information on these awards.\nDD&A. The $45.7 million increase in DD&A expense was a result of an increase in production driven by a greater number of producing wells in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had 282 net producing Appalachian wells, an 97% increase when compared to the number of producing wells as of December 31, 2015. In addition, the increase in DD&A was the result of an increase in midstream assets placed in service in 2016 as compared to the prior year and the related depreciation of those assets. As of December 31, 2016, we had 251 miles and 129 miles of gas gathering and water pipeline, respectively, an increase of 50% and 15%, respectively, when compared to the prior year. On a per unit basis, DD&A expense decreased $0.39, or 24%, from $1.60 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.21 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAcquisition expense. The $4.9 million increase in acquisition expense was primarily attributable to costs associated with the Vantage Acquisition.\nInterest expense. The $12.2 million increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a full year recognition of expense associated with the prior year issuance of $400.0 million of the 2023 Notes. In addition, interest expense increased due to higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facilities during 2016 as compared to 2015 in order to fund our capital expenditures.\n(Loss) gain on derivative instruments. The $220.2 million loss on derivative contracts in 2016 was due to net cash receipts of $210.5 million on the settlement of maturing contracts and offset by a $430.8 million unrealized loss. The $273.7 million gain on derivative contracts in 2015 was due to net cash receipts of $193.9 million and a $79.8 million unrealized gain.\nIncome tax benefit (expense). The $154.3 million decrease in income tax expense year-over-year was driven by our net pre-tax loss, creating an income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNoncontrolling interest. The $2.4 million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was attributable to a $54.5 million loss from noncontrolling interest associated with the 16.49% of membership interests in Rice Energy Operating the Vantage Sellers received in connection with the Vantage Acquisition. Offsetting the loss from noncontrolling interest was a decrease in Rice Energy Operating's indirect ownership in RMP from 41% as of December 31, 2015 to 26% as of December 31, 2016. The decrease in ownership percentage year-over-year was primarily attributable to RMP's June 2016 and October 2016 equity offerings. In addition, the increase in RMP's net income year-over-year from $52.5 million in 2015 to $121.6 million in 2016 contributed to the $20.9 million net income in noncontrolling interest balance as of December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal operating revenues. The $111.2 million increase in total operating revenues was mainly a result of an increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in production was a result of increased drilling and completion activity in 2015, mainly in Washington County, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. The impact of increased production volumes on operating revenues was offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price in 2015 was $2.21 per Mcf compared to $3.65 per Mcf in 2014, in each case before the effect of hedges. Additionally, operating revenues were positively impacted by a $43.7 million increase in gathering, compression and water service revenues year-over-year. This increase primarily relates to increased third-party volumes and revenues on new gathering contracts. The increase in operating revenues for 2015 were offset by a $22.8 million decrease year-over-year in firm transportation sales, net, from the sale of unutilized capacity as we further utilize our existing contracts for our own operated production.\nLease operating expenses. The $19.4 million increase in lease operating expenses is attributable to an increase in the number of producing wells in 2015 as compared to 2014. However, lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased year-over-year due to improved efficiencies, primarily relating to production water recycling.\nGathering, compression and transportation. Gathering, compression and transportation expense for 2015 of $84.7 million is mainly comprised of $68.2 million of transportation contracts with third parties, $8.3 million of gathering charges from third parties and $4.2 million of charges from our working interest partners on our non-operated wells. The $49.1 million increase in\nexpense was primarily attributable to increased firm transportation contracts in 2015 compared to 2014, which is consistent with increased production.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. The $12.4 million increase in midstream operation and maintenance expense in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to additional contract labor costs, additional leases and on compression equipment and utility costs incurred as a result of our continued midstream build-out.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense decreased $69.9 million in 2015 compared to 2014. In 2014, the $106.0 million expense primarily consisted of $44.5 million and $41.7 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings and NGP Holdings incentive units, respectively, $3.4 million of non-cash compensation expense related to extinguishment of the legacy incentive unit burden of Mr. Daniel J. Rice III and $16.4 million related to payments made to certain holders of NGP Holdings incentive units. In 2015, the $36.1 million expense consisted of $33.7 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $26.7 million related to payments made to certain holders of NGP Holdings incentive units, offset by $24.3 million of non-cash income related to the fair market value adjustment for the NGP Holdings incentive units which was largely driven by the decline in our stock price at December 31, 2015. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-14. Incentive Units\u201d for additional information.\nImpairment of goodwill. The $294.9 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 related to a full impairment of goodwill associated with our Exploration and Production segment. In performing the annual goodwill impairment analysis, management considered the negative industry and market trends, including the decline in commodity prices and overall market performance of our peers and ourselves, to be the primary reasons of impairment.\nGeneral and administrative expense. The $41.5 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to the additions of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. At December 31, 2015, we had 371 employees as compared to 290 employees at December 31, 2014. Additionally, general and administrative expenses increased year-over-year as a result of the costs associated with our accounting system implementation and information technology projects to support our growth activities. Included in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of $16.5 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nDD&A. The $166.5 million increase in DD&A expense was a result of an increase in production driven by a greater number of producing wells in 2015 compared to 2014, which is consistent with our expanded drilling program and increased production during the year. In addition, the increase was the result of an increase in midstream assets placed in service in 2015 as compared to 2014 and the related depreciation of those assets.\nInterest expense. The $37.3 million increase in interest expense was a result of our issuance of $400.0 million of the 2023 Notes and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to fund midstream capital expenditures in 2015.\nGain on purchase of Marcellus joint venture. The $203.6 million gain on acquisition in the first quarter of 2014 was attributable to our acquisition of Alpha Holdings' 50% interest in our Marcellus joint venture in connection with the closing of our IPO. As a result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership in our Marcellus joint venture, we were required to remeasure our equity investment at fair value, which resulted in the non-recurring gain.\nGain on derivative instruments. The $273.7 million gain on derivative contracts in 2015 was due to net cash receipts of $193.9 million on the settlement of maturing contracts and a $79.8 million unrealized gain. The $186.5 million gain on derivative contracts in 2014 was due to net cash payments of $18.8 million and a $205.3 million unrealized gain.\nEquity in income (loss) of joint ventures. The $2.7 million decrease in equity income of joint ventures is the result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in our Marcellus joint venture in January 2014, as we consolidate the operations of our Marcellus joint venture subsequent to the acquisition.\nIncome tax expense. The $79.5 million decrease in income tax expense year-over-year was attributable to a decrease in taxable income and a lower estimated annual effective tax rate.\nNoncontrolling interest. The $22.8 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily attributable to us recognizing a full year of noncontrolling interest related to our investment in RMP as compared to the 10-day period in 2014.\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nAs a result of changes to our operations and organizational structure in the first quarter of 2016, we now manage our business in three business segments: Exploration and Production, Rice Midstream Holdings and Rice Midstream Partners. We\nevaluate our business segments based on their contribution to our consolidated results based on operating income. Please see Note 8-Financial Results by Business Segment\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a break-down of the operating results and assets of our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. All prior period results have been revised to reflect the new reporting segment structure.\nThe following tables set forth selected operating and financial data for each business segment for the year

revenues. The $206.9 million increase in natural gas, oil and NGL sales was mainly a result of an increase in production in 2016 compared to 2015, as discussed above. In addition, post-acquisition revenue associated with the Vantage Acquisition was $51.6 million for the period from October 19, 2016 through December 31, 2016. The increase in operating revenues was slightly offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price in 2016 was $2.14 per Mcf compared to $2.21 per Mcf in 2015, in each case before the effect of hedges. Additionally, the increase in other revenue of approximately $18.0 million was primarily driven by our natural gas marketing activities.\nLease operating expenses. The $6.4 million increase in lease operating expenses was attributable to an increase in our production base in 2016 as compared to the prior year. However, on a per unit basis, lease operating expenses decreased from $0.22 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.17 for the year ended December 31, 2016 due to improved efficiencies, primarily relating to production water recycling.\nGathering, compression and transportation. Gathering, compression and transportation expense for 2016 of $232.5 million includes $127.9 million of affiliate and third party gathering fees and $105.1 million of transportation contracts with third parties. The $82.5 million increase in gathering, compression and transportation expenses was mainly due to increased volumes under the gathering agreements with the Rice Midstream Partners segment and the Rice Midstream Holdings segment, as well as increased firm transportation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProduction taxes and impact fees. Production taxes are directly related to natural gas, oil and NGLs sales. The $6.3 million, or 82%, increase in production taxes for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily related to the 49% increase in natural gas, oil and NGLs sales.\nExploration. The increase in exploration expense year over year of $12.0 million was primarily due to leasehold write-offs, mainly associated with expired leaseholds.\nImpairment of gas properties. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $20.9 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in impairment expense related to our gas properties. In 2016, we recognized $20.9 million of impairment expense in the consolidated statement of operations related to lease expirations on non-core assets. In 2015, we determined that the carrying value of our Upper Devonian proved property was not fully recoverable and as a result, we recognized a $10.9 million impairment expense to write-down such proved properties to fair value. In addition, we recognized $7.3 million of impairment expense in 2015 due to changes in our development plans and lease expirations.\nImpairment of goodwill. The $294.9 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 related to a full impairment of goodwill associated with our Exploration and Production segment. In performing the annual goodwill impairment analysis, management considered the negative industry and market trends, including the decline in commodity prices and overall market performance of our peers and ourselves, to be the primary reasons of impairment.\nGeneral and administrative expense. For the year ended December 31, 2016, general and administrative expense (before stock compensation expense) decreased $2.8 million, or 4%, primarily due to a decrease in allocated costs associated with personnel and administrative expenses as the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment continue to grow. On a per unit basis, general and administrative expense (before stock compensation expense) decreased by 35%, from $0.34 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.22 per Mcfe during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a 51% increase in production. Included in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of $13.4 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nDD&A. The $42.0 million increase was a result of an increase in production and greater number of producing wells in 2016 compared to 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had 282 net producing Appalachian wells, an 97% increase when compared to the number of producing wells as of December 31, 2015. On a per unit basis, DD&A expense decreased $0.38 per Mcfe, or 25%, from $1.53 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1.15 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal operating revenues. The $87.3 million increase in natural gas, oil and NGL sales was mainly a result of an increase in production in 2015 compared to 2014 as discussed above. The impact of increased production volumes on operating revenues was offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price in 2015 was $2.21 per Mcf compared to $3.65 per Mcf in 2014, in each case before the effect of hedges. The increase in operating revenues for 2015 were offset by a $22.8 million decrease year-over-year in firm transportation sales, net, from the sale of unutilized capacity as we further utilize our existing contracts for our own operated production.\nLease operating expenses. The $19.4 million increase in lease operating expenses year-over-year was attributable to an increase in the number of producing wells in 2015 as compared to the prior year. However, lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased year-over-year due to improved efficiencies, primarily relating to production water recycling.\nGathering, compression and transportation. Gathering, compression and transportation expense for 2015 of $150.0 million includes $73.6 million of affiliate and third party gathering fees, $68.2 million of transportation contracts with third parties and $4.2 million of charges from our working interest partners on our non-operated wells. The $112.6 million increase in gathering, compression and transportation expenses was mainly due to the gathering agreements with the Rice Midstream Partners segment and the Rice Midstream Holdings segment as well as increased firm transportation expense in 2015 compared to 2014, which is consistent with increased production.\nImpairment of goodwill. The $294.9 million impairment of goodwill in 2015 related to a full impairment of goodwill associated with our Exploration and Production segment. In performing the annual goodwill impairment analysis, management considered the negative industry and market trends, including the decline in commodity prices and overall market performance of our peers and ourselves, to be the primary reasons of impairment.\nGeneral and administrative expense. The $32.4 million increase in segment general and administrative expense year-over-year was primarily attributable to the additions of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. Included in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of $11.0 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nDD&A. The $156.3 million increase was a result of an increase in production and greater number of producing wells in 2015 compared to 2014.\nRice Midstream Holdings Segment\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td>

The $36.6 million increase in total operating revenues was mainly the result of a 187% period over period increase in affiliate gathering volumes between the Exploration and Production segment and the Rice Midstream Holdings segment, as well as an increase in third-party gathering volumes, which include revenues associated with the contracts for Strike Force Midstream.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. Midstream operation and maintenance expense increased $0.9 million primarily due to pipeline maintenance expenses associated with Strike Force Midstream, which began operations in February 2016.\nImpairment of fixed assets. The $20.3 million impairment expense in 2016 was primarily related to pipeline assets that were decommissioned.\nGeneral and administrative expense. The $7.7 million increase in segment general and administrative expense year-over-year (before equity compensation expense) was primarily attributable to costs associated with personnel to support the Rice Midstream Holdings segment. Included in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of $5.0 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase was due to an increase in the allocation of our equity-based compensation expense to the Rice Midstream Holdings segment related to awards made under our equity-based compensation plans in 2016.\nDD&A. The $3.0 million increase in DD&A year-over-year was primarily the result of an increase in midstream assets placed in service in 2016 as compared to 2015 and the related depreciation on those assets. As of December 31, 2016, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment had 92 miles of gathering system pipelines, a 71% increase from December 31, 2015 primarily due to the addition of gathering system pipeline assets associated with Strike Force Midstream.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal operating revenues. The $26.5 million increase in total operating revenues year-over-year was mainly the result of an increase in volumes associated with the gathering contracts between the Exploration and Production segment and Rice Midstream Holdings segment (that were not in place for substantially all of 2014).\nMidstream operation and maintenance. Midstream operation and maintenance expense increased $2.0 million year-over-year which primarily related to contract labor and maintenance costs.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense is allocated to the Rice Midstream Holdings segment based on our estimate of the expense attributable to the Rice Midstream Holdings segment's operations. The $5.3 million decrease in incentive unit expense year-over-year is consistent with the decrease in incentive unit expense to us.\nGeneral and administrative expense. The $3.1 million increase in segment general and administrative expense year-over-year was primarily attributable to costs associated with the additions of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. Included in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of $1.0 million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nDD&A. The $2.6 million increase in DD&A year-over-year was primarily the result of an increase in midstream assets placed in service in 2015 as compared to 2014 and the related depreciation on those

Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTotal operating revenues. Operating revenues increased from $114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $201.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $87.2 million. The increase in operating revenues primarily relates to increased gathering and compression revenues associated with a 52% and 794% increase in period over period gathering and compression throughput, respectively. In addition, the increase relates to a $32.3 million increase in water services revenues due to a 61% increase in fresh water distribution volumes from 777 MMgal in 2015 to 1,253 MMgal in 2016.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. Total operation and maintenance expense increased from $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase was primarily due to on and off pad water transfer costs and water procurement, in addition to increased expenses following the Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition, primarily associated with water transfer costs and pipeline maintenance costs.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $1.0 million was allocated to the Water Assets by Rice Energy prior to their acquisition. No incentive unit expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expense. General and administrative expense (before equity compensation expense) increased from $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $18.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.4 million, or 40%. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in allocated costs associated with personnel and administrative expenses as the Rice Midstream Partners segment continues to grow. Included in general and administrative expense is equity compensation expense of $2.9 million and $4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased from $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $8.8 million. The increase year-over-year was primarily due to additional assets placed into service in 2016, including assets related to gathering, compression and water handling and treatment services. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our gathering and water pipeline miles increased 40% and 15%, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nTotal operating revenues. The $108.0 million increase in total operating revenues year-over-year was mainly the result of the gathering and water service contracts between the Exploration and Production segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment (that were not in place for substantially all of 2014) as well as an increase in volumes associated with existing third-party gathering contracts.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. Midstream operation and maintenance expense for 2015 includes $9.0 million of expense relative to our fresh water services assets and $6.0 million of expense relative to our gathering assets. The $10.4 million increase in expense year-over-year was primarily due to contract labor and maintenance costs as well additional leases and utilities on compression equipment.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was allocated to the Water Assets prior to their acquisition by RMP. Incentive unit expense of $13.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was allocated to RMP's gathering and compression assets prior to the RMP IPO and to the Water Assets.\nGeneral and administrative expense. The $6.0 million increase in segment general and administrative expense year-over-year was primarily attributable to the additions of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. Included in general and administrative expense is equity compensation expense of $4.5 million and $0.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nDD&A. The $12.2 million increase in DD&A year-over-year was primarily the result of an increase in midstream assets placed in service in 2015 as compared to 2014 and the related depreciation on those assets.\nOutlook\nDuring recent years, the oil and natural gas industry experienced a significant decrease in commodity prices driven by a global supply/demand imbalance for oil and an oversupply of natural gas in the United States as a result of increased productivity and warm winters. Our revenues, operating results, cash flows from operations, capital spending and future growth rates are highly dependent on the global commodity-price markets, which affect the value we receive from sales of our natural gas. While commodity price volatility has continued into 2017, we believe the long-term outlook for our business is favorable due to our low cost structure, technological advances, financial strengths, risk management, responsible capital allocation and development strategic capital.\nNatural gas prices have historically been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, prevailing economic conditions, supply and demand of hydrocarbons in the marketplace and geopolitical events such as wars or natural disasters. For example, the Henry Hub spot market price had rose from a low of $1.49 per MMBtu on March 4, 2016 to a high of $3.80 per MMBtu on December 7, 2016. In the future, we expect to be increasingly subject to fluctuations in oil and NGL prices. Sustained periods of low commodity prices could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, our results of operations, the quantities of natural gas that we can economically produce and our ability to access capital.\nWe use commodity derivative instruments, such as swaps, puts and collars, to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our natural gas production. These arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases, but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases. Please see -Commodity Hedging Activities.\u201d In addition, we have entered into long-term firm transportation arrangements\npursuant to which our production is shipped to markets that we expect to be less impacted by basis differentials. In recent years, the cost of new firm transportation projects has risen significantly concurrent with the increasing basis differentials experienced in the Appalachian Basin. While entering into these firm transportation arrangements provides flow assurance for our natural gas production, there can be no assurance that the net impact of entering into such arrangements, after giving effect to their costs, will result in more favorable sales prices for our production in the future than local pricing. As such, our net sales prices may be materially less than NYMEX Henry Hub prices as a result of basis differentials and/or firm transportation costs.\nOur future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. In 2017, we plan to invest $1,890.0 million in our operations, including $585.0 million for drilling and completion in the Marcellus Shale, $450.0 million for drilling and completion in the Utica Shale, $225.0 million for leasehold acquisitions and $630.0 million for midstream infrastructure development, including $315.0 million expected to be invested by each RMP and Midstream Holdings, respectively. We expect to fund our 2017 capital expenditures with cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. Our 2017 capital budget may be further adjusted as business conditions warrant. The amount, timing and allocation of capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. If natural gas prices decline to levels below our acceptable levels, or costs increase to levels above our acceptable levels, we could choose to defer a significant portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity and prioritize capital projects that we believe will have the highest expected rates of return and potential to generate near-term cash flow. We routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in commodity prices, availability of financing, drilling and acquisition costs, industry conditions, the timing of regulatory approvals, the availability of rigs, success or lack of success in drilling activities, contractual obligations, internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control.\nOur 2017 capital budget reflects a continuation of the strategy we employed in 2016. We believe that we will be able to fully fund the capital expenditures of our Exploration and Production segment with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Furthermore, we believe that we will be able to fully fund the capital expenditures of our Rice Midstream Holdings and Rice Midstream Partners segments with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, cash flows from operations and cash on hand.\nWe will continue to evaluate the natural gas price environments and may adjust our capital spending plans to maintain appropriate levels of liquidity and financial flexibility.\nOur revenues, cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control, such as economic, political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy.\nWe believe that cash on hand, operating cash flows, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our current cash requirements, including normal operating needs, debt service obligations, capital expenditures, and commitments and contingencies. However, to the extent that we consider market conditions favorable, we may access the capital markets to raise capital from time to time to fund acquisitions or future capital expenditures, pay down our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and for general working capital purposes. See -Debt Agreements\u201d below for additional details on our outstanding borrowings and available liquidity under our various financing arrangements.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity have been the proceeds from equity and debt financings and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of natural gas properties and associated midstream infrastructure. As we pursue reserve and production growth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. We also expect to fund a portion of these requirements with cash flow from operations as we continue to bring additional upstream and midstream production online.\nOur and RMP's credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. We and RMP cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for or will not be lowered for any given period of time. If our credit ratings are downgraded, we and RMP may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of certain commercial agreements, such as pipeline capacity and construction contracts, the amount of which may be significant, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease.\nThe table below reflects Rice Energy's credit rating for debt instruments as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Senior Unsecured Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's Investors Service ( Moody's)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standard & Poor's Rating Service ( S&P)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $485.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $413.0 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increase in production in 2016 and cash receipts on settled derivatives, net of increases in cash operating costs, interest expense and a decrease in commodity price.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $413.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $85.1 million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increase in production in 2015 and cash receipts on settled derivatives, offset by an increase in cash operating expenses and interest expense.\nCash Flow Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016 cash flows used in investing activities was $1,917.6 million, which was primarily associated with the Vantage Acquisition and the acquisition and development of our natural gas properties compared to $1,217.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which primarily included capital expenditures for property and equipment.\nCapital expenditures for exploration and production were $690.2 million and $869.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $178.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in the acquisition and development of our natural gas properties.\nCapital expenditures for the Rice Midstream Holdings segment totaled $110.9 million and $156.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $45.1 million was due to a decrease in capital expenditures for Rice Olympus Midstream LLC's midstream infrastructure, offset by an increase in capital expenditures for Strike Force Midstream infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures for the Rice Midstream Partners segment totaled $118.1 million and $248.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease of $130.4 million was attributable to a greater focus on capital expenditures for compression stations and well pad connects rather than the build out of our trunk lines.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 cash flows used in investing activities was $1,217.0 million, which primarily included capital expenditures for property and equipment compared to $1,481.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 related to $970.3 million of capital expenditures for property and equipment and $524.1 million related to acquisition activity.\nCapital expenditures for the Exploration and Production segment were $869.1 million and $693.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $176.0 million was primarily attributable to the acquisition and development of our natural gas properties.\nCapital expenditures for the Rice Midstream Holdings segment totaled $156.0 million and $107.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase of $48.7 million was due to the expansion of our midstream infrastructure year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures for the Rice Midstream Partners segment totaled $248.5 million and $169.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease of $78.7 million was due to a midstream acquisition in 2014 with no comparable acquisition in 2015.\nCash Flow Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $1,749.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily associated with proceeds from our September 2016 and the April 2016 equity offering, proceeds from the Partnership's June 2016 offering and proceeds from the Partnership's at-the-market common unit offering program (the ATM program\u201d), offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facilities, and distributions to the Partnership's public unitholders. Net cash provided by financing activities of $699.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the proceeds from our 2023 Notes offering, borrowings on the Midstream Holdings Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) and the RMP\nRevolving Credit Facility (defined below), as well as proceeds from the Private Placement (defined below) offset by distributions to the RMP's public unitholders. Net cash provided by financing activities of $1,620.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily the result of the proceeds from our IPO, the 2022 Notes offering, the RMP IPO and the August 2014 equity offering, which was partially offset by repayments of debt.\nDebt Agreements\nSenior Notes\nWe have $900.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2022 Notes outstanding.

Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, Midstream Holdings is required to pay the Purchasers a quarterly cash commitment fee of 2.0% per annum on any undrawn amounts of the additional $125.0 million commitment. Midstream Holdings used approximately $75.0 million of the proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under its credit facility and to pay transaction fees and expenses, and the remaining $300.0 million was distributed to us.\nApril 2016 Equity Offering\nOn April 15, 2016, we issued and completed the April 2016 Equity Offering of an aggregate of 34,337,725 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $16.35 per share, which included 20,000,000 shares sold by us and 9,858,891 shares sold by NGP Holdings. On April 21, 2016, NGP Holdings sold an additional 4,478,834 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase additional shares. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $15.0 million and transaction costs, we received net proceeds of $311.8 million. We received no proceeds from the sale of shares by NGP Holdings. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nJune 2016 Common Unit Offering\nOn June 13, 2016, RMP completed an underwritten public offering of an aggregate of 9,200,000 common units representing limited partner interests in RMP at a price to the public of $18.50 per unit, which included 1,200,000 common units sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional units. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $6.0 million and transaction costs, RMP received net proceeds of approximately $164.1 million.\nRMP used a portion of the net proceeds to repay outstanding debt and intends to use the remainder for general partnership purposes, including the repayment of debt, acquisitions and capital expenditures.\nSeptember 2016 Equity Offering\nOn September 30, 2016, we issued and completed the September 2016 Equity Offering of an aggregate of 40,000,000 shares of common stock at a price to the public of $25.50 per share. On October 11, 2016, we sold an additional 6,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares of common stock in connection with the September 2016 Equity Offering. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $17.9 million and transaction costs, we received net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, which includes proceeds from the exercised underwriters' option. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the Vantage Acquisition. We will use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. See Note 13 for additional information.\nPrivate Placement\nOn October 7, 2016, RMP issued 20,930,233 common units representing limited partner interests in RMP in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $450.0 million, or $21.50 per unit (the Private Placement\u201d). After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $9.4 million, RMP received net proceeds of $440.6 million. RMP primarily used the proceeds of the Private Placement to fund a portion of the Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition. The Private Placement closed on October 7, 2016. As a result of the Private Placement, as of December 31, 2016, GP Holdings owned approximately 28% of RMP, consisting of 3,623 common units, 28,753,623 subordinated units and all of the incentive distribution rights.\nCommodity Hedging Activities\nOur primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the spot regional market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas production. Pricing for natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price.\nTo mitigate the potential negative impact on our cash flow caused by changes in oil and natural gas prices, we have entered into financial commodity derivative contracts in the form of swaps, zero cost collars, calls, puts and basis swaps to ensure that we receive minimum prices for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production when management believes that favorable future prices can be secured. We typically hedge the NYMEX Henry Hub price for natural gas. Pursuant to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are now permitted to hedge the greater of (i) the percentage of proved reserve volumes (Column A) or (ii) the percentage of internally forecasted production (Column B).\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Months next succeeding the time as of which compliance is measured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Column A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Column B\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Months 1 through 18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Months 19 through 36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Months 37 through 60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur hedging activities are intended to support natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations. The counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the floor price specified in the contract and the settlement price, which is based on market prices on the settlement date, if the settlement price is below the floor price. We are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the ceiling price and the settlement price if the ceiling price is below the settlement price. These contracts may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and zero cost collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. For a description of our commodity derivative contracts, please see Notes 5 and 6 under Item 8 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We do not designate our current portfolio of commodity derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes. Therefore, changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in earnings. Please read", "summary": "This report provides an overview of Rice Energy's financial condition, operations, and performance, emphasizing the organization's shift to managing business in three operating segments - Exploration and Production, Rice Midstream Holdings, and Rice Midstream Partners.

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview of Our Business\nRice Energy is an independent natural gas and oil company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGL properties in the Appalachian Basin. As a result of changes to our operations and organizational structure in 2016, we now manage our business in three operating segments - the Exploration and Production segment, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment. These segments are managed separately due to their distinct operational differences. The Exploration and Production segment is responsible for the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGLs. The Rice Midstream Holdings segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production for us and third parties in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio. The Rice Midstream Partners segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and in the provision of water services to support the well completion services of us and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio.\nAs a result of certain reorganizations and transactions that occurred during 2014, 2015 and 2016, our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented in this Annual Report may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward. For example, information for the period from January 1, 2014 until January 29, 2014, as contained within the year ended December 31, 2014 pertains to the historical financial statements and results of operations of Rice Drilling B LLC, our accounting predecessor. Such periods reflect only our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture. From and after our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest from Alpha Holdings on January 29, 2014, the results of operations of our Marcellus joint venture are consolidated into our results of operations.\nIn connection with the RMP IPO in December 2014, we contributed to RMP all of our gas gathering and compression assets in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania in exchange for, among other things, common and subordinated units representing a 50% limited partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in RMP. Indirectly, through Midstream Holdings, we own and control the general partner of RMP, and, as such, the results of operations of RMP are consolidated into our results of operations. However, while our results of operations consolidate the results of operations of RMP for periods subsequent to December 22, 2014, they give effect to the noncontrolling interest in RMP held by its public unitholders.\nAlso in connection with the RMP IPO, we entered into various gas gathering and compression agreements and water distribution services agreements, both intercompany and, in the case of certain gas gathering and compression services in Pennsylvania, with RMP. Prior to December 22, 2014, with certain limited exceptions, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment did not charge fees for providing such services to our Exploration and Production segment. From December 22, 2014 through October 31, 2015, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment charged the Exploration and Production segment water services fees according to the water services agreements entered into in connection with the RMP IPO. Beginning on November 1, 2015, as a result of the closing of the acquisition of PA Water and OH Water by RMP, the Rice Midstream Partners segment charges the Exploration and Production segment water services fees according to certain water services agreements entered in connection with the acquisition. These gathering and water services fees are eliminated through consolidation.\nFollowing completion of the Vantage Acquisition, we operate Vantage through Rice Energy Operating. As part of the consideration for the Vantage Acquisition, the Vantage Sellers were issued common units in Rice Energy Operating. In connection with the issuance of such membership interests to the Vantage Sellers, us and the Vantage Sellers entered into the Third A&R LLC Agreement. Under the Third A&R LLC Agreement, we control all of the day-to-day business affairs and decision making of Rice Energy Operating without approval of any other member, unless otherwise stated in the Third A&R LLC Agreement. As such, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Rice Energy Operating and the day-to-day management of Rice Energy Operating's business. Pursuant to the terms of the Third A&R LLC Agreement, we cannot, under any circumstances, be removed or replaced as the sole manager of Rice Energy Operating, except by our own election so long as it remains a member of Rice Energy Operating.\nSources of Revenues\nThe substantial majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of natural gas and do not include the effects of derivatives. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in realized prices. Our gathering, compression and water services revenues are primarily derived from our gathering and compression contracts in addition to fees charged to outside working interest owners.\nThe following table provides detail of our operating revenues from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\n\nNYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices are widely-used benchmarks in the pricing of natural gas. The following table provides the high and low prices for NYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices and our differential to the average of those benchmark prices for the periods indicated.\n\n (1) Differential is calculated by comparing the average NYMEX Henry Hub price to our volume weighted average realized price per MMBtu before hedges, including 50% of the volumes sold by our Marcellus joint venture for the period from January 1, 2014 through January 28, 2014, contained within the year ended December 31, 2014. The remainder of the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects 100% of the volumes sold by our Marcellus joint venture.  We sell a substantial majority of our production to two natural gas marketers, Sequent and BP. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to Sequent and BP represented 25% and 24% of our total sales, respectively. If our natural gas marketers decided to stop purchasing natural gas from us, our revenues could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Although a substantial portion of production is purchased by these customers, we do not believe the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, as other customers or markets would be accessible to us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our Exploration and Production segment accounted for 87% of our operating revenues. While we anticipate that the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our operating revenues in future periods, we expect that a substantial majority of our operating revenues will remain attributable to our Exploration and Production segment.\nPrincipal Components of Our Cost Structure\n \u2022 Lease operating expense. These are the day to day operating costs incurred to maintain production of our natural gas producing wells. Such costs include field personnel costs, produced water disposal, maintenance and repairs. Cost levels for these expenses can vary based on supply and demand for oilfield services. \n \u2022 Gathering, compression and transportation. These are costs incurred to bring natural gas to the market. Such costs include fees paid to third parties who operate low- and high-pressure gathering systems that transport our natural gas. We often enter into firm transportation contracts that secure takeaway capacity that includes minimum volume commitments, the cost for which is included in these expenses. \n \u2022 Midstream operation and maintenance. These are costs incurred to operate and maintain our low- and high-pressure natural gas gathering and compression systems and our water services assets used to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water. \n \u2022 Incentive unit expense. These costs represent non-cash compensation expense for incentive units awarded to certain of our employees by NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings. In connection with our IPO and related corporate reorganization, the holders of incentive units in REO contributed a portion of their incentive units to Rice Holdings and NGP Holdings in return for substantially similar incentive units in such entities. This resulted in the incentive units being deemed to have been modified, and the performance conditions were considered to be probable of occurring. Therefore, their fair values were measured and compensation expense from the date of initial grant through December 31, 2016 has been recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016. The payment obligation as it relates to the incentive units resides with NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings and has not been, and will not be borne by us. In April 2016, NGP Holdings settled its remaining incentive unit obligation in connection with our April 2016 Equity Offering. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense. These costs include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our exploration and production operations, midstream operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance expenses. General and administrative expense also includes stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Please see Note 16- Stock-Based Compensation\u201d in the notes of the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n \u2022 Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas. As a successful efforts\u201d company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units of production method. \n \u2022 Interest expense. We have financed a portion of our working capital requirements and property acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our Notes. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by the level of drilling, completion and acquisition activities, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We will likely continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow. To date, we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. \n \u2022 Gain on derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas. We recognize gains and losses associated with our open commodity derivative contracts as commodity prices and the associated fair value of our commodity derivative contracts change. The commodity derivative contracts we have in place are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, these commodity derivative contracts are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss in our results of operations. Cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty. \n \u2022 Income tax expense. We are a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, subject to federal income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% of pretax earnings. The reorganization of our business into a corporation in connection with the closing of our IPO required the recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for the initial temporary differences at the time of our IPO. The resulting deferred tax liability of approximately $162.3 million was recorded in equity at the date of our IPO. Based on our deductions primarily related to intangible drilling costs ( IDCs\u201d), we could potentially generate significant net operating loss assets and deferred tax liabilities. We may report and pay state income or franchise taxes in periods where our IDC deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income or franchise taxes are determined on another basis. \nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nIn evaluating our financial results, we focus on production, revenues, per unit cash production costs and general and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses. We also evaluate our rates of return on invested capital in our wells, and we measure the expected return of our wells based on EUR and the related costs of acquisition, development and production.\nWe believe the quality of our assets combined with our technical and managerial expertise can generate attractive rates of return as we develop our core acreage position in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Additionally, by focusing on concentrated acreage positions, we can build and own centralized midstream infrastructure, including low- and high-pressure gathering lines, compression facilities and water pipeline systems, which enable us to reduce reliance on third-party operators, minimize costs and increase our returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nBelow are some highlights of our consolidated financial and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n \u2022 Our natural gas, oil and NGL sales were $653.4 million, $446.5 million and $359.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 Our production volumes were 304.4 Bcfe, 201.3 Bcfe and 97.7 Bcfe in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 Our gathering, compression and water services revenues were $101.1 million, $49.2 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 Our per unit cash production costs were $0.63 per Mcfe, $0.68 per Mcfe and $0.67 per Mcfe in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nThe following tables set forth selected operating and financial data for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014:\n\n (1) The effect of hedges includes realized gains and losses on commodity derivative transactions. \n\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTotal operating revenues. The $276.8 million increase in total operating revenues was mainly a result of a 51% increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production from 201.3 Bcfe in 2015 to 304.4 Bcfe in 2016. During 2016, we turned 70 gross (63 net) wells into sales, of which 14 gross (14 net) wells were acquired in the Vantage Acquisition. The increase in operating revenues was slightly offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price in 2016 was $2.14 per Mcf compared to $2.21 per Mcf in 2015, in each case before the effect of hedges. Operating revenues were also positively impacted by a $51.9 million, or 105%, increase in gathering, compression and water service revenues year-over-year. This increase primarily relates to an increase in third-party volumes and revenues on our gathering contracts. In addition, post-acquisition revenue associated with the Vantage Acquisition was $51.6 million for the period from October 19, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nLease operating expenses. The $6.2 million increase in lease operating expenses was attributable to an increase in our production base in 2016 as compared to the prior year. However, on a per unit basis, lease operating expenses decreased from $0.22 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.17 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease on a per unit basis was attributable to improved efficiencies, primarily relating to production water recycling and reduced flowback periods.\nGathering, compression and transportation. Gathering, compression and transportation expense for 2016 of $123.9 million was mainly comprised of $105.1 million of transportation contracts with third parties and $19.3 million of gathering charges from third parties. The $39.1 million, or 46%, increase in expense was primarily attributable to a 51% increase in production volumes, as well as increased firm transportation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExploration. The increase in exploration expense year over year of $12.0 million was primarily due to leasehold write-offs, mainly associated with expired leaseholds.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. The $6.2 million increase in midstream operation and maintenance expense in 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to on and off pad water transfer costs and water procurement, in addition to increased expenses following the Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition primarily associated with water transfer and pipeline maintenance costs. On a per unit basis, midstream operation and maintenance expense was $0.08 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense increased $15.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. In 2016, the $51.8 million expense consisted of $24.5 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $27.3 million of compensation expense related to a cumulative adjustment to equal the cumulative cash payment made by NGP Holdings to NGP Holdings incentive unitholders. In 2015, the $36.1 million expense consisted of $33.7 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $26.7 million related to payments made to certain holders of NGP Holdings incentive units, offset by $24.3 million of non-cash income related to the fair market value adjustment for the NGP Holdings incentive units which was largely driven by the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2015. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units as a result of the April 2016 settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. See Item 1. Financial Statements-Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-14. Incentive Units\u201d for additional information.\nImpairment of gas properties. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded $20.9 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in impairment expense related to our gas properties. In 2016, we recognized $20.9 million of impairment expense in the consolidated statement of operations related to lease expirations on non-core assets. In 2015, we determined that the carrying value of our Upper Devonian proved property was", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions, or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview of Our Business\nRice Energy is an independent natural gas and oil company focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGL properties in the Appalachian Basin. As a result of changes to our operations and organizational structure in 2016, we now manage our business in three operating segments - the Exploration and Production segment, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment. These segments are managed separately due to their distinct operational differences. The Exploration and Production segment is responsible for the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGLs. The Rice Midstream Holdings segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production for us and third parties in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio. The Rice Midstream Partners segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania, and in the provision of water services to support the well completion services of us and third parties in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio.\nAs a result of certain reorganizations and transactions that occurred during 2014, 2015 and 2016, our historical financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented in this Annual Report may not be comparable, either from period to period or going forward. For example, information for the period from January 1, 2014 until January 29, 2014, as contained within the year ended December 31, 2014 pertains to the historical financial statements and results of operations of Rice Drilling B LLC, our accounting predecessor. Such periods reflect only our 50% equity investment in our Marcellus joint venture. From and after our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest from Alpha Holdings on January 29, 2014, the results of operations of our Marcellus joint venture are consolidated into our results of operations.\nIn connection with the RMP IPO in December 2014, we contributed to RMP all of our gas gathering and compression assets in Washington and Greene Counties, Pennsylvania in exchange for, among other things, common and subordinated units representing a 50% limited partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights in RMP. Indirectly, through Midstream Holdings, we own and control the general partner of RMP, and, as such, the results of operations of RMP are consolidated into our results of operations. However, while our results of operations consolidate the results of operations of RMP for periods subsequent to December 22, 2014, they give effect to the noncontrolling interest in RMP held by its public unitholders.\nAlso in connection with the RMP IPO, we entered into various gas gathering and compression agreements and water distribution services agreements, both intercompany and, in the case of certain gas gathering and compression services in Pennsylvania, with RMP. Prior to December 22, 2014, with certain limited exceptions, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment did not charge fees for providing such services to our Exploration and Production segment. From December 22, 2014 through October 31, 2015, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment charged the Exploration and Production segment water services fees according to the water services agreements entered into in connection with the RMP IPO. Beginning on November 1, 2015, as a result of the closing of the acquisition of PA Water and OH Water by RMP, the Rice Midstream Partners segment charges the Exploration and Production segment water services fees according to certain water services agreements entered in connection with the acquisition. These gathering and water services fees are eliminated through consolidation.\nFollowing completion of the Vantage Acquisition, we operate Vantage through Rice Energy Operating. As part of the consideration for the Vantage Acquisition, the Vantage Sellers were issued common units in Rice Energy Operating. In connection with the issuance of such membership interests to the Vantage Sellers, us and the Vantage Sellers entered into the Third A&R LLC Agreement. Under the Third A&R LLC Agreement, we control all of the day-to-day business affairs and decision making of Rice Energy Operating without approval of any other member, unless otherwise stated in the Third A&R LLC Agreement. As such, we, through our officers and directors, are responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Rice Energy Operating and the day-to-day management of Rice Energy Operating's business. Pursuant to the terms of the Third A&R LLC Agreement, we cannot, under any circumstances, be removed or replaced as the sole manager of Rice Energy Operating, except by our own election so long as it remains a member of Rice Energy Operating.\nSources of Revenues\nThe substantial majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of natural gas and do not include the effects of derivatives. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in realized prices. Our gathering, compression and water services revenues are primarily derived from our gathering and compression contracts in addition to fees charged to outside working interest owners.\nThe following table provides detail of our operating revenues from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Natural gas sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>646,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>441,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Oil and NGL sales\n</td> <td>6,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gathering, compression and water services\n</td> <td>101,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>24,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>778,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>502,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNYMEX Henry Hub prompt month contract prices are widely-used benchmarks in the pricing of natural gas.

The remainder of the year ended December 31, 2014 reflects 100% of the volumes sold by our Marcellus joint venture.  We sell a substantial majority of our production to two natural gas marketers, Sequent and BP. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to Sequent and BP represented 25% and 24% of our total sales, respectively. If our natural gas marketers decided to stop purchasing natural gas from us, our revenues could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Although a substantial portion of production is purchased by these customers, we do not believe the loss of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, as other customers or markets would be accessible to us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our Exploration and Production segment accounted for 87% of our operating revenues. While we anticipate that the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our operating revenues in future periods, we expect that a substantial majority of our operating revenues will remain attributable to our Exploration and Production segment.\nPrincipal Components of Our Cost Structure\n \u2022 Lease operating expense. These are the day to day operating costs incurred to maintain production of our natural gas producing wells. Such costs include field personnel costs, produced water disposal, maintenance and repairs. Cost levels for these expenses can vary based on supply and demand for oilfield services. \n \u2022 Gathering, compression and transportation. These are costs incurred to bring natural gas to the market. Such costs include fees paid to third parties who operate low- and high-pressure gathering systems that transport our natural gas. We often enter into firm transportation contracts that secure takeaway capacity that includes minimum volume commitments, the cost for which is included in these expenses. \n \u2022 Midstream operation and maintenance. These are costs incurred to operate and maintain our low- and high-pressure natural gas gathering and compression systems and our water services assets used to support well completion activities and to collect and recycle or dispose of flowback and produced water. \n \u2022 Incentive unit expense. These costs represent non-cash compensation expense for incentive units awarded to certain of our employees by NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings. In connection with our IPO and related corporate reorganization, the holders of incentive units in REO contributed a portion of their incentive units to Rice Holdings and NGP Holdings in return for substantially similar incentive units in such entities. This resulted in the incentive units being deemed to have been modified, and the performance conditions were considered to be probable of occurring. Therefore, their fair values were measured and compensation expense from the date of initial grant through December 31, 2016 has been recognized in the year ended December 31, 2016. The payment obligation as it relates to the incentive units resides with NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings and has not been, and will not be borne by us. In April 2016, NGP Holdings settled its remaining incentive unit obligation in connection with our April 2016 Equity Offering. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units. \n \u2022 General and administrative expense. These costs include overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our exploration and production operations, midstream operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance expenses. General and administrative expense also includes stock-based compensation expense related to awards granted under our long-term incentive plan. Please see Note 16- Stock-Based Compensation\u201d in the notes of the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report. \n \u2022 Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD&A\u201d) includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas. As a successful efforts\u201d company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts and allocate these costs to each unit of production using the units of production method. \n \u2022 Interest expense. We have financed a portion of our working capital requirements and property acquisitions with borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our Notes. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by the level of drilling, completion and acquisition activities, as well as fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We will likely continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow. To date, we have not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes. \n \u2022 Gain on derivative instruments. We utilize commodity derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas. We recognize gains and losses associated with our open commodity derivative contracts as commodity prices and the associated fair value of our commodity derivative contracts change. The commodity derivative contracts we have in place are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Consequently, these commodity derivative contracts are recorded at fair value at each balance sheet date with changes in fair value recognized as a gain or loss in our results of operations. Cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual settlements under the contracts result in making a payment to or receiving a payment from the counterparty. \n \u2022 Income tax expense. We are a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, subject to federal income taxes at a statutory rate of 35% of pretax earnings. The reorganization of our business into a corporation in connection with the closing of our IPO required the recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for the initial temporary differences at the time of our IPO. The resulting deferred tax liability of approximately $162.3 million was recorded in equity at the date of our IPO. Based on our deductions primarily related to intangible drilling costs ( IDCs\u201d), we could potentially generate significant net operating loss assets and deferred tax liabilities. We may report and pay state income or franchise taxes in periods where our IDC deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income or franchise taxes are determined on another basis. \nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nIn evaluating our financial results, we focus on production, revenues, per unit cash production costs and general and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses. We also evaluate our rates of return on invested capital in our wells, and we measure the expected return of our wells based on EUR and the related costs of acquisition, development and production.\nWe believe the quality of our assets combined with our technical and managerial expertise can generate attractive rates of return as we develop our core acreage position in the Marcellus and Utica Shales. Additionally, by focusing on concentrated acreage positions, we can build and own centralized midstream infrastructure, including low- and high-pressure gathering lines, compression facilities and water pipeline systems, which enable us to reduce reliance on third-party operators, minimize costs and increase our returns.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nBelow are some highlights of our consolidated financial and operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n \u2022 Our natural gas, oil and NGL sales were $653.4 million, $446.5 million and $359.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 Our production volumes were 304.4 Bcfe, 201.3 Bcfe and 97.7 Bcfe in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 Our gathering, compression and water services revenues were $101.1 million, $49.2 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n \u2022 Our per unit cash production costs were $0.63 per Mcfe, $0.68 per Mcfe and $0.67 per Mcfe in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \nThe following tables set forth

2015\nTotal operating revenues. The $276.8 million increase in total operating revenues was mainly a result of a 51% increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production from 201.3 Bcfe in 2015 to 304.4 Bcfe in 2016. During 2016, we turned 70 gross (63 net) wells into sales, of which 14 gross (14 net) wells were acquired in the Vantage Acquisition. The increase in operating revenues was slightly offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price in 2016 was $2.14 per Mcf compared to $2.21 per Mcf in 2015, in each case before the effect of hedges. Operating revenues were also positively impacted by a $51.9 million, or 105%, increase in gathering, compression and water service revenues year-over-year. This increase primarily relates to an increase in third-party volumes and revenues on our gathering contracts. In addition, post-acquisition revenue associated with the Vantage Acquisition was $51.6 million for the period from October 19, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nLease operating expenses. The $6.2 million increase in lease operating expenses was attributable to an increase in our production base in 2016 as compared to the prior year. However, on a per unit basis, lease operating expenses decreased from $0.22 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0.17 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease on a per unit basis was attributable to improved efficiencies, primarily relating to production water recycling and reduced flowback periods.\nGathering, compression and transportation. Gathering, compression and transportation expense for 2016 of $123.9 million was mainly comprised of $105.1 million of transportation contracts with third parties and $19.3 million of gathering charges from third parties. The $39.1 million, or 46%, increase in expense was primarily attributable to a 51% increase in production volumes, as well as increased firm transportation expense for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExploration. The increase in exploration expense year over year of $12.0 million was primarily due to leasehold write-offs, mainly associated with expired leaseholds.\nMidstream operation and maintenance. The $6.2 million increase in midstream operation and maintenance expense in 2016 compared to the prior year was primarily due to on and off pad water transfer costs and water procurement, in addition to increased expenses following the Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition primarily associated with water transfer and pipeline maintenance costs. On a per unit basis, midstream operation and maintenance expense was $0.08 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nIncentive unit expense. Incentive unit expense increased $15.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015. In 2016, the $51.8 million expense consisted of $24.5 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $27.3 million of compensation expense related to a cumulative adjustment to equal the cumulative cash payment made by NGP Holdings to NGP Holdings incentive unitholders. In 2015, the $36.1 million expense consisted of $33.7 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $26.7 million related to payments made to certain holders of NGP Holdings incentive units, offset by $24.3 million of non-cash income related to the fair market value adjustment for the NGP Holdings incentive units which was largely driven by the decline in our stock price as of December 31, 2015. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units as a result of the April 2016 settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. See Item 1.
