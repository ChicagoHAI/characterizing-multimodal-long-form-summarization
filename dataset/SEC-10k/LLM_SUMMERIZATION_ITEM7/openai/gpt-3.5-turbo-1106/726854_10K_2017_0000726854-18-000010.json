City National is a retail and consumer-oriented community bank with 86 bank branches in West Virginia (57), Virginia (14), Kentucky (12) and Ohio (3). City National provides credit, deposit, and trust and investment management services to its customers in a broad geographical area that includes many rural and small community markets in addition to larger cities including Charleston (WV), Huntington (WV), Martinsburg (WV), Winchester (VA), Staunton (VA), Virginia Beach (VA), Ashland (KY) and Lexington (KY). In the Company's key markets, the Company's primary subsidiary, City National, generally ranks in the top three relative to deposit market share and the top two relative to branch share (Charleston/Huntington MSA, Beckley/Lewisburg counties, Staunton MSA and Winchester, VA/WV Eastern Panhandle counties). In addition to its branch network, City National's delivery channels include automated-teller-machines (\"ATMs\"), interactive-teller-machines (\"ITMs\"), mobile banking, debit cards, interactive voice response systems, and Internet technology. The Company's business activities are currently limited to one reportable business segment, which is community banking.\nIn January 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, to The Hilb Group effective January 1, 2015. As a result of this sale, the Company recognized a one-time after tax gain of $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nOn November 6, 2015, the Company purchased three branch locations from American Founders Bank, Inc. ( AFB\u201d) located in Lexington, Kentucky. The Company acquired approximately $119 million in performing loans and assumed deposit liabilities of approximately $145 million. The Company paid AFB a deposit premium of 5.5% on non-time deposits and 1.0% on premium loan balances acquired.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnotes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available to management as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from management's estimates. As this information changes, management's estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Company's financial statements and related disclosures may also change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified: (i) the determination of the allowance for loan losses and (ii) income taxes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nThe Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides management's analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses and related provision. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance for loan losses related to loans considered to be impaired is generally evaluated based on the discounted cash flows using the impaired loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. The allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits is generally determined by analyzing potential exposure and other qualitative factors that could negatively impact the overall credit risk of the loan portfolio. Loans not individually evaluated for impairment are grouped by pools with similar risk characteristics and the related historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current inherent risk factors, such as unemployment, overall economic conditions, concentrations of credit, loan growth, classified and impaired loan trends, staffing, adherence to lending policies, and loss trends.\nThe Income Taxes section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides management's analysis of the Company's income taxes. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In computing the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments regarding interpretation of laws in those jurisdictions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations for many types of transactions is susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing\nauthorities. On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate for the year and uses that rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next twelve months as a result of various factors. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2016.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nThe Company's financial performance over the previous three years is summarized in the following table:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available to common shareholders (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share, basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share, diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROA*\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROE*\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROATCE*\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*ROA (Return on Average Assets) is a measure of the effectiveness of asset utilization. ROE (Return on Average Equity) is a measure of the return on shareholders' investment. ROATCE (Return on Average Tangible Common Equity) is a measure of the return on shareholders' equity less intangible assets.\nThe Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 6.5%, from $119.8 million in 2016 to $127.6 million in 2017 (see Net Interest Income). The Company's provision for loan losses decreased $1.4 million from $4.4 million in 2016 to $3.0 million in 2017 (see Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses). Non-interest income increased $4.8 million and non-interest expense decreased $0.2 million (see Non-Interest Income and Expense). As a result of a reduction in the corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, the Company reassessed its deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in additional deferred income taxes of $7.1 million (see Income Taxes). As a result, the Company's net income increased $2.2 million from $52.1 million in 2016 to $54.3 million in 2017 and the Company achieved a return on assets of 1.33%, a return on tangible equity of 13.1% and an efficiency ratio of 51.5%.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSelected balance sheet fluctuations are summarized in the following table (in millions):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>629.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross loans\n</td> <td>3,127.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,046.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax assets, net\n</td> <td>11,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(57.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>3,315.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,231.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shareholders' equity\n</td> <td>502.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>442.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment securities increased $89 million, or 16.6%, from $540 million at December 31, 2016, to $629 million at December 31, 2017. During 2017, in conjunction with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company elected to grow investment balances and maintain cash balances to enhance net interest income.\nGross loans increased $81 million, or 2.7%, from $3.05 billion at December 31, 2016 to $3.13 billion at December 31, 2017. Commercial loans increased $70.9 million (5.0%) and residential real estate loans increased $16.8 million (1.2%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nDeferred tax assets decreased $16 million, or (57.4)%, from $28 million at December 31, 2016 to $12 million at December 31, 2017. This is primarily due to the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets associated with the\nenactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). This remeasurement decreased the Company's net deferred tax assets by $7.1 million. In addition, the deferred tax asset associated with other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities decreased by $3.4 million due to the sales of those securities during the year (see Income taxes).\nTotal deposits increased $84 million, or 2.6%, from $3.23 billion at December 31, 2016 to $3.32 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase is due to growth in interest bearing demand deposits of $73.4 million and growth in time deposits of $42.1 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in savings deposit accounts ($25.8 million) and noninterest-bearing deposits ($5.6 million).\nShareholders' equity increased $60.1 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 (see Capital Resources).\nTABLE TWO\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST INCOME\n(In thousands)\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

Company's net interest income increased from $118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 6.5%, from $119.8 million in 2016 to $127.6 million in 2017. This increase was due primarily to higher average balances on commercial loans ($132.0 million) which increased interest income by $5.1 million, and residential real estate loans ($33.5 million) which increased interest income by $1.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased interest yields on residential real estate loans also increased net interest income by $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($86.9 million) increased investment income by $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense on interest bearing deposits ($3.0 million), primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds, and lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions ($1.0 million). The Company's reported net interest margin decreased from 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from fair value adjustments, the net interest margin would have been 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $266 million from 2016 to 2017, due to increases in commercial, financial, and agriculture loans ($132 million), investment securities ($87 million) and residential real estate loans ($34 million). Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $173 million from 2016 due to increases in savings deposits ($60 million), short-term borrowings ($54 million), time deposits ($38 million) and interest-bearing demand deposits ($20 million).\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe Company's net interest income increased from $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $4.0 million, or 3.4%, from $115.9 million in 2015 to $119.8 million in 2016. This increase was due primarily to an increase in average loan balances from organic growth ($127 million) and from loans associated with the acquisition of three branches in the Lexington, Kentucky market in November 2015 (approximately $102 million in loans) contributing additional net interest income of $9.0 million in 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($111.5 million) increased net interest income by $3.9 million. During 2016, in conjunction with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company elected to grow investment balances and reduce cash balances to enhance net interest income. As part of this strategy, the Company purchased tax-exempt municipal securities to improve its earnings by lowering its effective income tax rate. As a result of this strategy, the Company's overnight borrowings increased during 2016 . These increases in net interest income were partially offset by lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions that decreased net interest income $3.8 million ($6.7 million in 2015 compared to $2.9 million in 2016) and margin compression, which lowered net interest income $3.9 million. The Company's reported net interest margin decreased from 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions, the net interest margin would have been 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 3.54% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily caused by loan yields (excluding accretion) compressing from 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and by the yield on investment securities decreasing from 3.28% to 3.01% for the same period.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $341 million from 2015 to 2016, due to increases in commercial, financial,\nand agriculture loans ($142 million), investment securities ($112 million) and residential real estate loans ($90 million). Average\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased $161 million from 2015 due to increases in savings deposits ($65 million), interest-bearing\ndemand deposits ($40 million), short-term borrowings ($31 million) and time deposits ($24 million).\nTABLE THREE\nRATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE\n(In thousands)\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance of the Company's operations. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The Company's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial performance without the impact of those items that may obscure trends in the Company's performance.

This is primarily due to increases in bankcard revenue of $0.6 million, or 3.9%, trust revenues of $0.4 million, or 8.8%, and service charges of $0.4 million, or 1.5%.\nNon-interest expenses increased $3.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. During 2015, the Company recognized $0.6 million of acquisition and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of three branches in Lexington, Kentucky. Excluding acquisition related expenses, non-interest expenses increased $3.8 million from $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was largely due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits ($2.1 million) due to salary adjustments and increased health insurance costs. In addition, non-interest expenses increased $1.7 million due to the annual operating costs of the three branches acquired in November 2015 and from an increase of $0.5 million in bankcard expenses due to increased transaction volumes.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $36.4 million, $25.1 million and $28.4 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company's effective tax rates for 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 40.2%, 32.5% and 34.4%, respectively. A reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the statutory rate is included in Note Twelve of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") into law. Among other things, the TCJA reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. This change required management to remeasure its deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new income tax rate. The provisional amount recorded as a result of the remeasurement was $7.1 million. Management continues to evaluate the TCJA and refine calculations which could potentially impact the measurement of these balances. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company reduced income tax expense by $0.3 million, $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax positions resulting from the close of the statute of limitations for previous tax years. Also, as a result of differences between the book and tax basis of the assets that were sold in conjunction with the sale of CityInsurance, the Company's income tax expense increased by $1.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Exclusive of these items, the Company's tax rate from operations was 32.7%, 33.2% and 33.6% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company's net deferred tax assets decreased from $28.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $11.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily driven by the income tax rate decrease as a result of the enactment of the TCJA. The components of the Company's net deferred tax assets are disclosed in Note Twelve of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Realization of the most significant net deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future events taking place that will reverse the current deferred tax assets. The deferred tax asset and/or liability associated with unrealized securities losses is the tax impact of the unrealized gains and/or losses on the Company's available-for-sale security portfolio. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively, associated with unrealized securities losses. The impact of the Company's unrealized losses is noted in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity as an adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). This deferred tax asset would be realized if the unrealized securities losses on the Company's securities were realized from either the sales or maturities of the related securities. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $0.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, associated with other-than-temporarily impaired securities. The decrease of $3.4 million is primarily due to sales of other-than-temporarily impaired securities. The deferred tax asset associated with the allowance for loan losses decreased from $7.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $4.4 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease of $2.9 million is primarily due to the income tax rate decrease associated with the TCJA. The deferred tax asset associated with the allowance for loan losses is expected to be realized as additional loan charge-offs, which have already been provided for within the Company's financial statements, are recognized for tax purposes. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that each of the deferred tax assets will be realized and that no valuation allowance was necessary as of December 31, 2017 or 2016.\nLIQUIDITY\nThe Company evaluates the adequacy of liquidity at both the Parent Company level and at the banking subsidiary level. At the Parent Company level, the principal source of cash is dividends from its banking subsidiary, City National. Dividends paid by City National to the Parent Company are subject to certain legal and regulatory limitations. Generally, any dividends in amounts that exceed the earnings retained by City National in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years must be approved by regulatory authorities. At December 31, 2017, City National could pay dividends up to $75.0 million without prior regulatory permission.\nDuring 2017, the Parent Company used cash obtained from the dividends received primarily to: (1) pay common dividends to shareholders, (2) remit interest payments on the Company's junior subordinated debentures and (3) fund repurchases\nof the Company's common shares. Additional information concerning sources and uses of cash by the Parent Company is reflected in Note Nineteen of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn December 19, 2016, the Company announced that it had filed a prospectus supplement to its existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the sale of its common stock having an aggregate value of up to $55 million through an at-the-market\u201d equity offering program. Through the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has sold approximately 548,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $64.82, net of broker fees. The Company has sold no shares since the first quarter of 2017. To date, the Company has received $36.4 million in gross proceeds. Under the program, the Company has the ability to receive an additional $18.6 million in gross proceeds from the sale of common shares.\nOver the next 12 months, the Parent Company has an obligation to remit interest payments approximating $0.8 million on the junior subordinated debentures held by City Holding Capital Trust III. Additionally, the Parent Company anticipates continuing the payment of dividends, which are expected to approximate $28.6 million on an annualized basis for 2018 based on common shareholders of record at December 31, 2017 at a dividend rate of $1.84 for 2018. However, interest payments on the debentures can be deferred for up to five years under certain circumstances and dividends to shareholders can, if necessary, be suspended. In addition to these anticipated cash needs, the Parent Company has operating expenses and other contractual obligations, which are estimated to require $1.4 million of additional cash over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2017, the Parent Company reported a cash balance of $59.0 million and management believes that the Parent Company's available cash balance, together with cash dividends from City National, will be adequate to satisfy its funding and cash needs over the next twelve months.\nExcluding the interest and dividend payments discussed above, the Parent Company has no significant commitments or obligations in years after 2018 other than the repayment of its $16.5 million obligation under the debentures held by City Holding Capital Trust III. However, this obligation does not mature until June 2038, or earlier at the option of the Parent Company. It is expected that the Parent Company will be able to obtain the necessary cash, either through dividends obtained from City National or the issuance of other debt, to fully repay the debentures at their maturity.\nCity National manages its liquidity position in an effort to effectively and economically satisfy the funding needs of its customers and to accommodate the scheduled repayment of borrowings. Funds are available to City National from a number of sources, including depository relationships, sales and maturities within the investment securities portfolio, and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") and other financial institutions. As of December 31, 2017, City National's assets are significantly funded by deposits and capital. City National maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and other financial institutions that can be accessed as necessary to fund operations and to provide contingency funding mechanisms. As of December 31, 2017, City National had the capacity to borrow an additional $1.6 billion from the FHLB and other financial institutions under existing borrowing facilities. City National maintains a contingency funding plan, incorporating these borrowing facilities, to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution-specific or systemic financial industry crisis. Also, although it has no current intention to do so, City National could liquidate its unpledged securities, if necessary, to provide an additional funding source. City National also segregates certain mortgage loans, mortgage-backed securities, and other investment securities in a separate subsidiary so that it can separately monitor the asset quality of these primarily mortgage-related assets, which could be used to raise cash through securitization transactions or obtain additional equity or debt financing if necessary.\nThe Company manages its asset and liability mix to balance its desire to maximize net interest income against its desire to minimize risks associated with capitalization, interest rate volatility, and liquidity. With respect to liquidity, the Company has chosen a conservative posture and believes that its liquidity position is strong. As illustrated in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company generated $77.8 million of cash from operating activities during 2017, primarily from interest income received on loans and investments, net of interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings.\nThe Company has obligations to extend credit, but these obligations are primarily associated with existing home equity loans that have predictable borrowing patterns across the portfolio. The Company has investment security balances with carrying values that totaled $629.0 million at December 31, 2017, and that greatly exceeded the Company's non-deposit sources of borrowing, which totaled $268.7 million.\nThe Company's net loan to asset ratio is 75.2% as of December 31, 2017 and deposit balances fund 80.2% of total assets as compared to 69.9% for its peers (Bank Holding Company Peer Group with assets ranging from $3 billion to $10 billion). Further, the Company's deposit mix has a very high proportion of transaction and savings accounts that fund 54.0% of the Company's total assets and the Company uses time deposits over $250,000 to fund 2.8% of total assets compared to its peers, which fund 13.1% of total assets with such deposits.\nINVESTMENTS\nThe Company's investment portfolio increased $89 million, or 16.5%, from $540 million at December 31, 2016, to $629 million at December 31, 2017. During 2017, in conjunction with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company elected to grow investment balances (primarily mortgage-backed and municipal securities) and maintain cash balances to enhance net interest income. As part of this strategy, the Company increased its tax-exempt municipal securities to improve its earnings by lowering its effective income tax rate.\nThe investment portfolio is structured to provide flexibility in managing liquidity needs and interest rate risk, while providing acceptable rates of return.\nThe majority of the Company's investment securities continue to be mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed securities in which the Company has invested are predominantly underwritten to the standards of, and guaranteed by government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae (\"FNMA\") and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\").\nThe Company's municipal bond portfolio of $96.2 million as of December 31, 2017 has an average tax equivalent yield of 4.43% with an average maturity of 12.2 years. The average dollar amount invested in each security is $0.5 million. The portfolio has 66% rated \"A\" or better and the remaining portfolio is unrated, as the issuances represented small issuances of revenue bonds. Additional credit support was been purchased by the issuer for 35% of the portfolio, while 65% has no additional credit support. Management does underwrite 100% of the portfolio on an annual basis, using the same guidelines that are used to underwrite its commercial loans. Revenue bonds were 71% of the portfolio, while the remaining 29% were general obligation bonds. Geographically, the portfolio supports the Company's footprint, with 70% of the portfolio being from municipalities throughout West Virginia, and the remainder from communities in Ohio, Indiana, and various other states.\nTABLE FIVE\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO\nThe carrying value of the Company's securities are presented in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Carrying Values as of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities available-for-sale:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Obligations of states and political subdivisions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>96,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> U.S. Treasuries and U.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage-backed securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> U.S. government agencies\n</td> <td>419,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>330,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Private label\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trust preferred securities\n</td> <td>4,736\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate securities\n</td> <td>22,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Debt Securities available-for-sale\n</td> <td>543,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>444,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>364,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketable equity securities\n</td> <td>5,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment funds\n</td> <td>1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Securities Available-for-Sale\n</td> <td>550,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities held-to-maturity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Mortgage backed securities\n</td> <td>60,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Trust preferred securities\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Securities Held-to-Maturity\n</td> <td>64,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other investment securities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Non-marketable equity securities\n</td> <td>14,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total Other Investment Securities\n</td> <td>14,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>628,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>539,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>471,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncluded in non-marketable equity securities in the table above at December 31, 2017 are $5.9 million of Federal Home Loan Bank stock and $8.2 million of Federal Reserve Bank stock.

Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a first lien on residential property. Residential real estate loans provide for the purchase or refinance of a residence and first-lien home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans primarily consist of single family 3 and 5 year adjustable rate mortgages with terms that amortize up to 30 years. City National also offers fixed-rate residential real estate loans that are sold in the secondary market that are not included on the Company's balance sheet once sold and City National does not retain the servicing rights to these loans. Residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten to comply with Fannie Mae guidelines, while the home equity loans are underwritten with typically less documentation, but with lower loan-to-value ratios and shorter maturities. At December 31, 2017, $25 million of the residential real estate loans were for properties under construction.\nHome equity loans decreased $2 million from December 31, 2016 to $139 million at December 31, 2017. City National's home equity loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a second (or junior) lien on a residential property. Home equity loans allow consumers to borrow against the equity in their home without paying off an existing first lien. These loans consist of home equity lines of credit (\"HELOC\") and amortized home equity loans that require monthly installment payments. Home equity loans are underwritten with less documentation, lower loan-to-value ratios and for shorter terms than residential real estate loans. The amount of credit extended is directly related to the value of the real estate at the time the loan is made.\nThe commercial and industrial (\"C&I\") loan portfolio consists of loans to corporate borrowers primarily in small to mid-size industrial and commercial companies. Collateral securing these loans includes equipment, machinery, inventory, receivables and vehicles. C&I loans are considered to contain a higher level of risk than other loan types, although care is taken to minimize these risks. Numerous risk factors impact this portfolio, including industry specific risks such as economy, new technology, labor rates and cyclicality, as well as customer specific factors, such as cash flow, financial structure, operating controls and asset quality. C&I loans increased $23 million to $208.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nCommercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages, which generally are secured by nonresidential and multi-family residential properties, including hotel/motel and apartment lending. Commercial real estate loans are to many of the same customers and carry similar industry risks as C&I loans, but have different collateral risk. Commercial real estate loans increased $48 million to $1.28 billion at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, $29 million of the commercial real estate loans were for commercial properties under construction.\nThe Company categorizes commercial loans by industry according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to monitor the portfolio for possible concentrations in one or more industries. Management monitors industry concentrations against internally designated percents of risk-based capital. As of December 31, 2017, City National was within its internally designated concentration limits. As of December 31, 2017, City National's loans to borrowers within the Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings categories exceeded 10% of total loans (13%). No other industry classification exceeded 10% of total loans as of December 31, 2017. Management also monitors non-owner occupied commercial real estate as a percent of risk based capital (based upon regulatory guidance). At December 31, 2017, the Company had $967.5 million of commercial loans classified as non-owner occupied and was within its designated concentration threshold.\nConsumer loans may be secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and other personal property. City National monitors the risk associated with these types of loans by monitoring such factors as portfolio growth, lending policies and economic conditions. Underwriting standards are continually evaluated and modified based upon these factors. Consumer loans decreased $3 million from 2016 to $29.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturity of loans outstanding as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Table 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Within One Year\n</td> <td>After One But Within Five Years\n</td> <td>After Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>497,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,468,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Home equity\n</td> <td>17,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and industrial\n</td> <td>71,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>108,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>303,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>572,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>401,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,277,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer\n</td> <td>15,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>546,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,243,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,337,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,127,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans maturing after one year with interest rates that are:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed until maturity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>338,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Variable or adjustable\n</td> <td>2,243,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,581,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES\nManagement systematically monitors the loan portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d) on a quarterly basis to provide for probable losses incurred in the portfolio. Management assesses the risk in each loan type based on historical delinquency and loss trends, the general economic environment of its local markets, individual loan performance, and other relevant factors. Individual credits in excess of $1 million are selected at least annually for detailed loan reviews, which are utilized by management to assess the risk in the portfolio and the appropriateness of the allowance. Due to the nature of commercial lending, evaluation of the appropriateness of the allowance as it relates to these loan types is often based more upon specific credit review, with consideration given to the potential impairment of certain credits and historical loss rates, adjusted for general economic conditions and other inherent risk factors. Conversely, due to the homogeneous nature of the real estate and installment portfolios, the portions of the allowance allocated to those portfolios are primarily based on prior loss history of each portfolio, adjusted for general economic conditions and other inherent risk factors. Risk factors considered by the Company in completing this analysis include: (1) unemployment and economic trends in the Company's markets, (2) concentrations of credit, if any, among any industries, (3) trends in loan growth, loan mix, delinquencies, losses or credit impairment, (4) adherence to lending policies and others. Each risk factor is designated as low, moderate/increasing, or high based on the Company's assessment of the risk to loss associated with each factor. Each risk factor is then weighted to consider probability of occurrence.\nThe allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits is generally determined by analyzing potential exposure and other qualitative factors that could negatively impact the overall credit risk of the loan portfolio. Loans not individually evaluated for impairment are grouped by pools with similar risk characteristics and the related historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current inherent risk factors, such as unemployment, overall economic conditions, concentrations of credit, loan growth, classified and impaired loan trends, staffing, adherence to lending policies, and loss trends.\nDetermination of the allowance for loan losses is subjective in nature and requires management to periodically reassess the validity of its assumptions. Differences between actual losses and estimated losses are assessed such that management can timely modify its evaluation model to ensure that adequate provision has been made for risk in the total loan portfolio.\nAs a result of the Company's analysis of the appropriateness of the ALLL, the Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $3.0 million, $4.4 million and $7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses recorded in 2017 reflects the revisions to the regulatory rating of a shared national credit (\"SNC\") in which the Company is a participant, changes in the quality of the portfolio and general improvement in the Company's historical loss rates used to compute the allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits. SNCs are credit facilities greater than $20 million that are shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions and are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The SNC that the Company is a participant is for a local customer that outgrew the lending limit of the Company and involves three local banks. The reserve recorded in 2017 of $1.1 million related to this SNC reflects the loss factors associated with the rating assigned to this SNC as a result of the current year review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"). The Company's balance outstanding at December 31, 2017 associated with this SNIC was $27.7 million, with an additional commitment of $6.2 million related to a line of credit to the borrower. As of December 31, 2017, the SNC was performing in accordance with terms and its debt service coverage ratios were acceptable. Changes in the amount of the allowance and related provision are based on the Company's detailed systematic methodology and are directionally consistent with changes in the composition and quality of the Company's loan portfolio. The Company believes its methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALLL adequately provides for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and produces a provision and allowance for loan losses that is directionally consistent with changes in asset quality and loss experience.\nThe Company had net charge-offs of $3.9 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Net charge-offs in 2017 consisted primarily of net charge-offs on residential real estate loans of $1.3 million, DDA overdraft loans of $1.3 million, and commercial real estate loans of $0.6 million.\nBased on the Company's analysis of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and in consideration of the known factors utilized in computing the allowance, management believes that the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2017 is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the Company's loan portfolio. Future provisions for loan losses will be dependent upon trends in loan balances including the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in loan quality and loss experience trends, and recoveries of previously charged-off loans, among other factors.\nTABLE SEVEN\nANALYSIS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nAn analysis of changes in the Company's allowance for loan losses follows (dollars in

The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when a loan becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest unless the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection. When interest accruals are discontinued, interest credited to income in the current year that is unpaid and deemed uncollectible is charged to operations. Prior-year interest accruals that are unpaid and deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan losses, provided that such amounts were specifically reserved.\nTABLE NINE\nIMPAIRED

court and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt. The filing of bankruptcy is deemed to be evidence that the borrower is in financial difficulty and the discharge of the debt by the bankruptcy court is deemed to be a concession granted to the borrower.\nThe Company's troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") related to its borrowers who had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection make up 74% of the Company's total TDRs as of December 31, 2017. The average age of these TDRs was 12.1 years; the average current balance as a percentage of the original balance was 68.2%; and the average loan-to-value ratio was 65.4% as of December 31, 2017. Of the total 461 Chapter 7 related TDRs, 31 had an estimated loss exposure based on the current balance and appraised value at December 31, 2017.\nTABLE ELEVEN\nALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nThe allocation of the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment and the percent of loans in each category to total loans is shown in the table below (dollars in thousands).

This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the historical loss rate in the portfolio.\nGOODWILL\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of November 30th, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant, such as a material adverse change in the business. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value. As described in Note One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company conducts its business activities through one reportable business segment - community banking. Fair values are estimated by reviewing the Company's stock price as it compares to book value and the Company's reported earnings. In addition, the impact of future earnings and activities are considered in the Company's analysis. The Company had approximately $76 million of goodwill at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and no impairment was required to be recognized in 2017 or 2016, as the estimated fair value of the Company has continued to exceed its book value.\nCERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT\nScheduled maturities of time certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more at December 31, 2017 are summarized in the table below (in thousands). The Company has time certificates of deposit that meet or exceed the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 totaling $122.4 million (approximately 11% of total time deposits).\nTABLE TWELVE\nMATURITY DISTRIBUTION OF CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT OF $100,000 OR MORE\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amounts\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Three months or less\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over three months through six months\n</td> <td>56,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over six months through twelve months\n</td> <td>122,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Over twelve months\n</td> <td>220,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in ASC Topic 820, whereby the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. The hierarchy classification is based on whether the inputs in the methodology for determining fair value are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-based information obtained from independent sources (Level 1 or Level 2), while unobservable inputs reflect management's estimate of market data (Level 3). Assets and liabilities that are actively traded and have quoted prices or observable market data require a minimal amount of subjectivity concerning fair value. Management's judgment is necessary to estimate fair value when quoted prices or observable market data are not available.\nAt December 31, 2017, approximately 14% of total assets, or $565 million, consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. Most of these financial instruments used valuation methodologies involving observable market data, collectively Level 1 and Level 2 measurements, to determine fair value. At December 31, 2017, approximately $14 million of derivative liabilities were recorded at fair value using methodologies involving observable market data. The Company does not believe that any changes in the unobservable inputs used to value the financial instruments mentioned above would have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. See Note Eighteen of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ASC Topic 820 and its impact on the Company's financial statements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company has various financial obligations that may require future cash payments according to the terms of the obligations. Demand, both noninterest- and interest-bearing, and savings deposits are, generally, payable immediately upon demand at the request of the customer. Therefore, the contractual maturity of these obligations is presented in the following table as less than one year.\u201d Time deposits, typically certificates of deposit, are customer deposits that are evidenced by an agreement between the Company and the customer that specify stated maturity dates and early withdrawals by the customer are subject to penalties assessed by the Company. Short-term borrowings and long-term debt represent borrowings of the Company and have stated maturity dates. Capital and operating leases between the Company and the lessor have stated expiration dates and renewal terms.\nTABLE THIRTEEN\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe composition of the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 is presented in the following table (in thousands):\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Contractual Maturity in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than One Year\n</td> <td>Between One and Three Years\n</td> <td>Between Three and Five Years\n</td> <td>Greater than Five Years\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>666,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>666,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand deposits(1)\n</td> <td>770,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>770,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings deposits(1)\n</td> <td>797,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>797,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits(1)\n</td> <td>575,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>464,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings(1)\n</td> <td>322,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td>718\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate leases\n</td> <td>982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,133,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,698,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes interest on both fixed- and variable-rate obligations.

This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that the Company has taken in its tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. As the ultimate amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable reliability, this estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs disclosed in Note Fifteen of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has also entered into agreements with its customers to extend credit or to provide conditional commitments to provide payment on drafts presented in accordance with the terms of the underlying credit documents (including standby and commercial letters of credit). The Company also provides overdraft protection to certain demand deposit customers that represent an unfunded commitment. As a result of the Company's off-balance sheet arrangements for 2017 and 2016, no material revenue, expenses, or cash flows were recognized. In addition, the Company had no other indebtedness or retained interests nor entered into agreements to extend credit or provide conditional payments pursuant to standby and commercial letters of credit.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nDuring 2017, Shareholders' Equity increased $60 million, or 13.6%, from $442 million at December 31, 2016 to $503\nmillion at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to net income of $54 million and the issuance of common shares of $28 million, partially offset by cash dividends declared of $28 million.\nOn September 24, 2014, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the Company to buy back up to 1,000,000 shares of its common shares (approximately 7% of outstanding shares) in open market transactions at prices that are accretive to the earnings per share of continuing shareholders. No time limit was placed on the duration of the share repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 231,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $43.34. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not repurchase any common shares. At December 31, 2017, the Company could repurchase approximately 279,000 shares under the current plan.\nOn December 19, 2016, the Company announced that it had filed a prospectus supplement to its existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 for the sale of its common stock having an aggregate value of up to $55 million through an \"at-the-market\" equity offering program. Through the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company has sold approximately 548,000 common shares at a weighted average price of $64.82, net of broker fees. The Company has sold no shares since the first quarter of 2017. To date, the Company has received $36.4 million in gross proceeds. Under the program, the Company has the ability to receive an additional $18.6 million in gross proceeds from the sale of common shares.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve published the final rules that established a new comprehensive capital framework for banking organizations, commonly referred to as Basel III. These final rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015 for smaller, non-complex banking organizations with full implementation by January 1, 2019.\nRegulatory guidelines require the Company to maintain a minimum common equity tier I (\"CET 1\") capital ratio of 5.75% and a total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratio of 9.25%, with at least one-half of capital consisting of tangible common stockholders' equity, and a minimum Tier I leverage ratio of 7.25%. Similarly, City National is also required to maintain minimum capital levels as set forth by various regulatory agencies. Under capital adequacy guidelines, City National is required to maintain minimum CET 1, total capital, Tier I capital, and leverage ratios of 5.75%, 9.25%, 7.25%, and 4.0%, respectively. To be classified as well capitalized,\u201d City National must maintain CET 1, total capital, Tier I capital, and leverage ratios of 6.5%, 10.0%, 8.0%, and 5.0%, respectively.\nWhen fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require City Holding and City National to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% \"capital conservation buffer\" (which is added to the 4.5% CET 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to the previous minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority's risk-adjusted measure for market risk).\nThe implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a countercyclical capital buffer\u201d that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to City Holding Company or City National Bank.\nThe aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.\nThe Company's regulatory capital ratios for both City Holding and City National are illustrated in the following table:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Virginia corporation headquartered in Charleston, West Virginia, is a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and conducts its principal activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, City National Bank of West Virginia (\"City National\"). City National is a retail and consumer-oriented community bank with 86 bank branches in West Virginia (57), Virginia (14), Kentucky (12) and Ohio (3). City National provides credit, deposit, and trust and investment management services to its customers in a broad geographical area that includes many rural and small community markets in addition to larger cities including Charleston (WV), Huntington (WV), Martinsburg (WV), Winchester (VA), Staunton (VA), Virginia Beach (VA), Ashland (KY) and Lexington (KY). In the Company's key markets, the Company's primary subsidiary, City National, generally ranks in the top three relative to deposit market share and the top two relative to branch share (Charleston/Huntington MSA, Beckley/Lewisburg counties, Staunton MSA and Winchester, VA/WV Eastern Panhandle counties). In addition to its branch network, City National's delivery channels include automated-teller-machines (\"ATMs\"), interactive-teller-machines (\"ITMs\"), mobile banking, debit cards, interactive voice response systems, and Internet technology. The Company's business activities are currently limited to one reportable business segment, which is community banking.\nIn January 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, to The Hilb Group effective January 1, 2015. As a result of this sale, the Company recognized a one-time after tax gain of $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nOn November 6, 2015, the Company purchased three branch locations from American Founders Bank, Inc. ( AFB\u201d) located in Lexington, Kentucky. The Company acquired approximately $119 million in performing loans and assumed deposit liabilities of approximately $145 million. The Company paid AFB a deposit premium of 5.5% on non-time deposits and 1.0% on premium loan balances acquired.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnotes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available to management as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from management's estimates. As this information changes, management's estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Company's financial statements and related disclosures may also change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified: (i) the determination of the allowance for loan losses and (ii) income taxes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nThe Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides management's analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses and related provision. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance for loan losses related to loans considered to be impaired is generally evaluated based on the discounted cash flows using the impaired loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. The allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits is generally determined by analyzing potential exposure and other qualitative factors that could negatively impact the overall credit risk of the loan portfolio. Loans not individually evaluated for impairment are grouped by pools with similar risk characteristics and the related historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current inherent risk factors, such as unemployment, overall economic conditions, concentrations of credit, loan growth, classified and impaired loan trends, staffing, adherence to lending policies, and loss trends.\nThe Income Taxes section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides management's analysis of the Company's income taxes. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In computing the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments regarding interpretation of laws in those jurisdictions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations for many types of transactions is susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing\nauthorities. On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate for the year and uses that rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next twelve months as a result of various factors. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2016.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nThe Company's financial performance over the previous three years is summarized in the following table:\n\n*ROA (Return on Average Assets) is a measure of the effectiveness of asset utilization. ROE (Return on Average Equity) is a measure of the return on shareholders' investment. ROATCE (Return on Average Tangible Common Equity) is a measure of the return on shareholders' equity less intangible assets.\nThe Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 6.5%, from $119.8 million in 2016 to $127.6 million in 2017 (see Net Interest Income). The Company's provision for loan losses decreased $1.4 million from $4.4 million in 2016 to $3.0 million in 2017 (see Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses). Non-interest income increased $4.8 million and non-interest expense decreased $0.2 million (see Non-Interest Income and Expense). As a result of a reduction in the corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, the Company reassessed its deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in additional deferred income taxes of $7.1 million (see Income Taxes). As a result, the Company's net income increased $2.2 million from $52.1 million in 2016 to $54.3 million in 2017 and the Company achieved a return on assets of 1.33%, a return on tangible equity of 13.1% and an efficiency ratio of 51.5%.\nBALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS\nSelected balance sheet fluctuations are summarized in the following table (in millions):\n\nInvestment securities increased $89 million, or 16.6%, from $540 million at December 31, 2016, to $629 million at December 31, 2017. During 2017, in conjunction with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company elected to grow investment balances and maintain cash balances to enhance net interest income.\nGross loans increased $81 million, or 2.7%, from $3.05 billion at December 31, 2016 to $3.13 billion at December 31, 2017. Commercial loans increased $70.9 million (5.0%) and residential real estate loans increased $16.8 million (1.2%) from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017.\nDeferred tax assets decreased $16 million, or (57.4)%, from $28 million at December 31, 2016 to $12 million at December 31, 2017. This is primarily due to the remeasurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets associated with the\nenactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). This remeasurement decreased the Company's net deferred tax assets by $7.1 million. In addition, the deferred tax asset associated with other-than-temporarily impaired investment securities decreased by $3.4 million due to the sales of those securities during the year (see Income taxes).\nTotal deposits increased $84 million, or 2.6%, from $3.23 billion at December 31, 2016 to $3.32 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase is due to growth in interest bearing demand deposits of $73.4 million and growth in time deposits of $42.1 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in savings deposit accounts ($25.8 million) and noninterest-bearing deposits ($5.6 million).\nShareholders' equity increased $60.1 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 (see Capital Resources).\nTABLE TWO\nAVERAGE BALANCE SHEETS AND NET INTEREST INCOME\n(In thousands)\n\n 1. For purposes of this table, non-accruing loans have been included in average balances and loan fees, which are immaterial, have been included in interest income.  2.Includes the Company's residential real estate and home equity loan categories.\n 3. Included in the above table are the following amounts (in thousands) for the accretion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company's recent acquisitions: \n\n4.Includes the Company's commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loan categories.\n5.Includes the Company's consumer and DDA overdrafts loan categories.\n6.Effective January 1, 2012, the carrying value of the Company's previously securitized loans was reduced to $0.\n7.Computed on a fully federal tax-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of approximately 35%.\nNET INTEREST INCOME\n2017 vs. 2016\nThe Company's net interest income increased from $118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $126.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 6.5%, from $119.8 million in 2016 to $127.6 million in 2017. This increase was due primarily to higher average balances on commercial loans ($132.0 million) which increased interest income by $5.1 million, and residential real estate loans ($33.5 million) which increased interest income by $1.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased interest yields on residential real estate loans also increased net interest income by $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($86.9 million) increased investment income by $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense on interest bearing deposits ($3.0 million), primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds, and lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions ($1.0 million). The Company's reported net interest margin decreased from 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from fair value adjustments, the net interest margin would have been 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $266 million from 2016 to 2017, due to increases in commercial, financial, and agriculture loans ($132 million), investment securities ($87 million) and residential real estate loans ($34 million). Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $173 million from 2016 due to increases in savings deposits ($60 million), short-term borrowings ($54 million), time deposits ($38 million) and interest-bearing demand deposits ($20 million).\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe Company's net interest income increased from $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $4.0 million, or 3.4%, from $115.9 million in 2015 to $119.8 million in 2016. This increase was due primarily to an increase in average loan balances from organic growth ($127 million) and from loans associated with the acquisition of three branches in the Lexington, Kentucky market in November 2015 (approximately $102 million in loans) contributing additional net interest income of $9.0 million in 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($111.5 million) increased net interest income by $3.9 million. During 2016, in conjunction with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company elected to grow investment balances and reduce cash balances to enhance net interest income. As part of this strategy, the Company purchased tax-exempt municipal securities to improve its earnings by lowering its effective income tax rate. As a result of this strategy, the Company's overnight borrowings increased during 2016 . These increases in net interest income were partially offset by lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions that decreased net interest income $3.8 million ($6.7 million in 2015 compared to $2.9 million in 2016) and margin compression, which lowered net interest income $3.9 million. The Company's reported net interest margin decreased from 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions, the net interest margin would have been 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 3.54% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily caused by loan yields (excluding accretion) compressing from 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and by the yield on investment securities decreasing from 3.28% to 3.01% for the same period.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $341 million from 2015 to 2016, due to increases in commercial, financial,\nand agriculture loans ($142 million), investment securities ($112 million) and residential real estate loans ($90 million). Average\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased $161 million from 2015 due to increases in savings deposits ($65 million), interest-bearing\ndemand deposits ($40 million), short-term borrowings ($31 million) and time deposits ($24 million).\nTABLE THREE\nRATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE\n(In thousands)\n\n 1. Fully federal taxable equivalent using a tax rate of approximately 35%. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement of the Company uses measures in its analysis of the Company's performance other than those in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance of the Company's operations. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The Company's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial performance without the impact of those items that may obscure trends in the Company's performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies. The following table reconciles fully taxable equivalent net interest income and fully taxable equivalent net interest income excluding accretion with net interest income as derived from the Company's financial statements (in thousands):\nTABLE FOUR\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(In thousands)\n\nNON-INTEREST INCOME AND NON-INTEREST EXPENSE\n2017 vs. 2016\nSelected income statement fluctuations are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company realized investment gains of $4.5 million and $3.5 million, respectively, from the sale of pools of trust preferred securities, which represented a partial recovery of impairment charges previously recognized.\nExclusive of these gains, non-interest income increased $3.8 million to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily due to increases in service charges of $1.9 million, or 7.0%, bank owned life insurance of $0.9 million, or 26.6% (primarily due to death benefit proceeds), trust revenues of $0.7 million, or 12.5%, and bankcard revenue of $0.6 million, or 3.7%.\nNon-interest expenses decreased $0.2 million from $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This is primarily due to decreases in occupancy related expenses of $0.6 million, or 5.6%, bankcard expenses of $0.5 million, or 12.0%, and FDIC insurance of $0.3 million, or 16.9%. These decreases were partially offset by increases in equipment and software related expenses of $0.5 million, or 7.2%, advertising of $0.3 million, or 11.8%, salaries and employee benefits of $0.2 million, or 0.3%, telecommunciation expenses of $0.2 million, or 9.7%, and repossessed asset losses, net of expenses, of $0.2 million or 17.4%.\n2016 vs. 2015\nSelected income statement fluctuations are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company realized investment gains of $3.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, from the call or sale of trust preferred securities, which represented a partial recovery of impairment charges previously recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $11.1 million.\nExclusive of these gains, non-interest income increased $1.3 million to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is primarily due to increases in bankcard revenue of $0.6 million, or 3.9%, trust revenues of $0.4 million, or 8.8%, and service charges of $0.4 million, or 1.5%.\nNon-interest expenses increased $3.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016. During 2015, the Company recognized $0.6 million of acquisition and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of three branches in Lexington, Kentucky. Excluding acquisition related expenses, non-interest expenses increased $3.8 million from $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCITY HOLDING COMPANY\nCity Holding Company (the Company\u201d), a West Virginia corporation headquartered in Charleston, West Virginia, is a registered financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act and conducts its principal activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, City National Bank of West Virginia (\"City National\"). City National is a retail and consumer-oriented community bank with 86 bank branches in West Virginia (57), Virginia (14), Kentucky (12) and Ohio (3). City National provides credit, deposit, and trust and investment management services to its customers in a broad geographical area that includes many rural and small community markets in addition to larger cities including Charleston (WV), Huntington (WV), Martinsburg (WV), Winchester (VA), Staunton (VA), Virginia Beach (VA), Ashland (KY) and Lexington (KY). In the Company's key markets, the Company's primary subsidiary, City National, generally ranks in the top three relative to deposit market share and the top two relative to branch share (Charleston/Huntington MSA, Beckley/Lewisburg counties, Staunton MSA and Winchester, VA/WV Eastern Panhandle counties). In addition to its branch network, City National's delivery channels include automated-teller-machines (\"ATMs\"), interactive-teller-machines (\"ITMs\"), mobile banking, debit cards, interactive voice response systems, and Internet technology. The Company's business activities are currently limited to one reportable business segment, which is community banking.\nIn January 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, to The Hilb Group effective January 1, 2015. As a result of this sale, the Company recognized a one-time after tax gain of $5.8 million in the first quarter of 2015.\nOn November 6, 2015, the Company purchased three branch locations from American Founders Bank, Inc. ( AFB\u201d) located in Lexington, Kentucky. The Company acquired approximately $119 million in performing loans and assumed deposit liabilities of approximately $145 million. The Company paid AFB a deposit premium of 5.5% on non-time deposits and 1.0% on premium loan balances acquired.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accounting policies of the Company conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and require management to make estimates and develop assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnotes. These estimates and assumptions are based on information available to management as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from management's estimates. As this information changes, management's estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Company's financial statements and related disclosures may also change. The most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note One of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, management has identified: (i) the determination of the allowance for loan losses and (ii) income taxes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments and, as such, could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available.\nThe Allowance and Provision for Loan Losses section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides management's analysis of the Company's allowance for loan losses and related provision. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an evaluation of individual credits in the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This determination is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance for loan losses related to loans considered to be impaired is generally evaluated based on the discounted cash flows using the impaired loan's initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans. The allowance not specifically allocated to individual credits is generally determined by analyzing potential exposure and other qualitative factors that could negatively impact the overall credit risk of the loan portfolio. Loans not individually evaluated for impairment are grouped by pools with similar risk characteristics and the related historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current inherent risk factors, such as unemployment, overall economic conditions, concentrations of credit, loan growth, classified and impaired loan trends, staffing, adherence to lending policies, and loss trends.\nThe Income Taxes section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides management's analysis of the Company's income taxes. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In computing the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments regarding interpretation of laws in those jurisdictions. Because the application of tax laws and regulations for many types of transactions is susceptible to varying interpretations, amounts reported in the financial statements could be changed at a later date upon final determinations by taxing\nauthorities. On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates its annual effective tax rate for the year and uses that rate to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits could change over the next twelve months as a result of various factors. The Company is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state taxing authorities for the years ended December 31, 2014 through 2016.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nThe Company's financial performance over the previous three years is summarized in the following table:\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income available to common shareholders (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share, basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share, diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROA*\n</td> <td>1.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>1.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROE*\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ROATCE*\n</td> <td>13.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*ROA (Return on Average Assets) is a measure of the effectiveness of asset utilization.

The Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 6.5%, from $119.8 million in 2016 to $127.6 million in 2017. This increase was due primarily to higher average balances on commercial loans ($132.0 million) which increased interest income by $5.1 million, and residential real estate loans ($33.5 million) which increased interest income by $1.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Increased interest yields on residential real estate loans also increased net interest income by $1.8 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($86.9 million) increased investment income by $3.2 million. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense on interest bearing deposits ($3.0 million), primarily due to an increase in the cost of funds, and lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions ($1.0 million). The Company's reported net interest margin decreased from 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 3.46% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from fair value adjustments, the net interest margin would have been 3.40% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $266 million from 2016 to 2017, due to increases in commercial, financial, and agriculture loans ($132 million), investment securities ($87 million) and residential real estate loans ($34 million). Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $173 million from 2016 due to increases in savings deposits ($60 million), short-term borrowings ($54 million), time deposits ($38 million) and interest-bearing demand deposits ($20 million).\n2016 vs. 2015\nThe Company's net interest income increased from $115.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $118.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company's tax equivalent net interest income increased $4.0 million, or 3.4%, from $115.9 million in 2015 to $119.8 million in 2016. This increase was due primarily to an increase in average loan balances from organic growth ($127 million) and from loans associated with the acquisition of three branches in the Lexington, Kentucky market in November 2015 (approximately $102 million in loans) contributing additional net interest income of $9.0 million in 2016. In addition, higher average investment balances ($111.5 million) increased net interest income by $3.9 million. During 2016, in conjunction with its interest rate risk management strategy, the Company elected to grow investment balances and reduce cash balances to enhance net interest income. As part of this strategy, the Company purchased tax-exempt municipal securities to improve its earnings by lowering its effective income tax rate. As a result of this strategy, the Company's overnight borrowings increased during 2016 . These increases in net interest income were partially offset by lower accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions that decreased net interest income $3.8 million ($6.7 million in 2015 compared to $2.9 million in 2016) and margin compression, which lowered net interest income $3.9 million. The Company's reported net interest margin decreased from 3.76% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.50% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the favorable impact of the accretion from fair value adjustments on recent acquisitions, the net interest margin would have been 3.41% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 3.54% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily caused by loan yields (excluding accretion) compressing from 4.05% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.96% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and by the yield on investment securities decreasing from 3.28% to 3.01% for the same period.\nAverage interest-earning assets increased $341 million from 2015 to 2016, due to increases in commercial, financial,\nand agriculture loans ($142 million), investment securities ($112 million) and residential real estate loans ($90 million). Average\ninterest-bearing liabilities increased $161 million from 2015 due to increases in savings deposits ($65 million), interest-bearing\ndemand deposits ($40 million), short-term borrowings ($31 million) and time deposits ($24 million).\nTABLE THREE\nRATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE\n(In thousands)\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td>

These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance of the Company's operations. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The Company's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial performance without the impact of those items that may obscure trends in the Company's performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies.

December 31, 2017 as compared to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This is primarily due to increases in service charges of $1.9 million, or 7.0%, bank owned life insurance of $0.9 million, or 26.6% (primarily due to death benefit proceeds), trust revenues of $0.7 million, or 12.5%, and bankcard revenue of $0.6 million, or 3.7%.\nNon-interest expenses decreased $0.2 million from $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This is primarily due to decreases in occupancy related expenses of $0.6 million, or 5.6%, bankcard expenses of $0.5 million, or 12.0%, and FDIC insurance of $0.3 million, or 16.9%. These decreases were partially offset by increases in equipment and software related expenses of $0.5 million, or 7.2%, advertising of $0.3 million, or 11.8%, salaries and employee benefits of $0.2 million, or 0.3%, telecommunciation expenses of $0.2 million, or 9.7%, and repossessed asset losses, net of expenses, of $0.2 million or 17.4%.\n2016 vs. 2015\nSelected income statement fluctuations are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment security gains\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of insurance division\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest income, excluding net investment securities gains and gain on sale of insurance division\n</td> <td>55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest expense\n</td> <td>96.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company realized investment gains of $3.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively, from the call or sale of trust preferred securities, which represented a partial recovery of impairment charges previously recognized.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, which resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax gain of $11.1 million.\nExclusive of these gains, non-interest income increased $1.3 million to $55.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This is primarily due to increases in bankcard revenue of $0.6 million, or 3.9%, trust revenues of $0.4 million, or 8.8%, and service charges of $0.4 million, or 1.5%.\nNon-interest expenses increased $3.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016.
