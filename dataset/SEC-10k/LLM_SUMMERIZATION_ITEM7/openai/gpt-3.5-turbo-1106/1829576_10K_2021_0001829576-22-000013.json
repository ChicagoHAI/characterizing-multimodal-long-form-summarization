MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Carter Bankshares, Inc., our operations, and our present business environment. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A includes the following sections:\n\u2022Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Our Business\n\u2022Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\u2022Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Liquidity\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Stock Repurchase Program\nThis section reviews our financial condition for each of the past two years and results of operations for each of the past three years. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current period presentation. Some tables may include additional time periods to illustrate trends within our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. The results of operations reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.\nExplanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States, management uses, and this annual report references, adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent, or ( FTE\u201d), basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying business, operational performance and performance trends as it facilitates comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial services industry. The Company believes the presentation of net interest income on an FTE basis ensures the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) is reconciled to net interest income adjusted to an FTE basis in the Net Interest Income section of the \"Results of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2021.\"\nAlthough management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances investors' understanding of our business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more relevant than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Over time, these estimates, assumptions and judgments may prove to be inaccurate or vary from actual results and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the periods presented or in future periods. We currently view the determination of the allowance for credit losses to be critical, because it is made in accordance with GAAP, is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management and have had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting estimates:\nAllowance for Credit Losses ( ACL\u201d)\nThe ACL represents an amount which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb expected credit losses on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and prepayment experience. The ACL is measured and recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. The ACL is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries of previous losses, and is increased or decreased by a provision for credit losses, which is recorded as a current period operating expense.\nDetermination of an appropriate ACL is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. The reasonableness of the ACL is reviewed quarterly by management.\nManagement believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the ACL and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the ACL requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio can vary from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected credit losses, future additions to the ACL may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes to the interest rate environment which may directly impact prepayment and curtailment rate assumptions, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nThe ACL base case\u201d model is derived from various economic forecasts provided by widely recognized sources. Management evaluates the variability of market conditions by examining the peak and trough of economic cycles. These peaks and troughs are used to stress the base case model to develop a range of potential outcomes. Management then determines the appropriate reserve through an evaluation of these various outcomes relative to current economic conditions and known risks in the portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2021 the range of outcomes would produce a 17% reduction or a 27% increase in reserves based on the best and worst case scenarios, respectively.\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL and Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business\nCarter Bankshares, Inc. (the Company\u201d) is a bank holding company headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia with assets of $4.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company is the parent company of its wholly owned subsidiary, Carter Bank & Trust (the Bank\u201d). The Bank is an insured, Virginia state-chartered bank, which operates branches in Virginia and North Carolina. The Company provides a full range of financial services with retail, and commercial banking products and insurance. Per the 2020 Annual Report of the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, our Company continues to be the fourth largest state-chartered bank by asset size at year end 2020. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CARE.\u201d\nThe Company earns revenue primarily from interest on loans and securities and fees charged for financial services provided to our customers. The Company incurs expenses for the cost of deposits, provision for credit losses and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy and tax expense.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nOur mission is that the Company strives to be the preferred lifetime financial partner for our customers and shareholders, and the employer of choice in the communities the Company is privileged to serve. Our strategic plan focuses on restructuring the balance sheet to provide more diversification and higher yielding assets to increase the net interest margin. Another area of focus is the transformation of the infrastructure of the Company to provide a foundation for operational efficiency and provide new products and services for our customers that will ultimately increase noninterest income.\nOur focus continues to be on loan and deposit growth with a shift in the composition of deposits to more low cost core deposits with less dependence in higher cost certificates of deposits ( CDs\u201d), as well as, implementing opportunities to increase fee income while closely monitoring our operating expenses. The Company is focused on executing this strategy to successfully build our brand and grow our business in our markets.\nThe Company's Response to COVID-19\nLending Operations\nThe Company elected to take advantage of Section 4014 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) provision to temporarily delay adoption of the CECL methodology. The Company was subject to the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) accounting method under the FASB ASU 2016-03 and related amendments, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020 and has since implemented CECL on January 1, 2021. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures relating to CECL in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company quickly responded to the pandemic and the CARES Act, offering the option of payment deferrals, participation in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), fee waivers and other relief actions to customers. In 2021 and, to date in 2022, we continued to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers by taking precautions to protect both customers and associates through enhanced cleaning services, social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements for both. A portion of the Company's workforce continues to work remotely.\nUnder the CARES Act, the PPP is an amendment to a program administered as part of the Small Business Administration's ( SBA\u201d)'s 7-A loan program. The Bank became an approved SBA 7-A lender in November 2019. The PPP is a guaranteed, unsecured loan program created to fund certain payroll and operating costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, $349 billion was approved and designated for the PPP in order for the SBA to guarantee 100% of collective loans made under the program to eligible small businesses, nonprofits, veteran's organizations, and tribal businesses. The Company participated in the initial round of funding through a referral relationship with a third-party, non-bank lender. When an additional $310 billion in funds were approved and designated for the PPP, we opted to set up an internal, automated loan process utilizing our core system provider.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d) implemented a liquidity facility available to financial institutions participating in the PPP. However, we opted to fund all PPP loans through our internal liquidity sources. These loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and do not represent a credit risk. The vast majority of these PPP loans have been forgiven.\nThe Bank provided loan payment deferrals to customers under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and regulatory interagency guidance regarding loan modifications. The Bank launched successive deferral programs with short-term expirations. The Part I program was launched on March 23, 2020 and expired on August 31, 2020. The deferrals in Part I provided for deferral of principal and up to the deferral of principal and interest, if requested through the expiry. The Part II program extended deferrals through December 31, 2020 subject to the collection of updated financial information and validation of need. For these borrowers the Bank requested verification of business and/or guarantor liquidity to ascertain the viability of the business in a post-pandemic environment. Prior to the extension of the CARES Act, the Bank launched the Part III program, which offered borrowers in the Part II program an extension of deferrals through June 30, 2021. Borrowers who opted into the Part III program were required to provide monthly financial statements and remit payments on a quarterly basis equal to the lesser of: i) 90% of free cash flow (EBITDA) or, ii) the otherwise contractual payment ( recapture payment\u201d). Following the expiration of the deferral programs on June 30, 2021, for term loans, payments were applied to accrued interest first and once accrued interest is current, payments will be applied to principal. Deferred principal will be due at maturity. For interest only loans, such as lines of credit, deferred interest will be due at maturity. Cumulative deferred interest totaled $12.0 million as of June 30, 2021, but declined to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2021.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nThe Bank also participated in the PPP established by the CARES Act. During the first round of PPP, we approved 451 loans that were referred to an online small business lender, totaling $17.9 million. Through the second round we had approved 515 loan applications totaling $39.9 million through our internal lending program, of which 498 loans totaling $38.5 million have been fully forgiven by the SBA. The $57.8 million in PPP loans originated during the first two rounds of PPP generated $1.5 million in fees, which have been, or will be, recognized in income as loans are forgiven, or over the remaining life of the loan for any portion that is not forgiven. On December 22, 2020 Congress passed legislation that was signed into law on December 27, 2020, making available a third round of PPP funding. We provided access to the program through our internal lending program for our current business customers. As of December 31, 2021, we had approved 136 loan applications totaling $11.0 million, of which 125 loans totaling $9.8 million have been fully forgiven by the SBA and generated an additional $0.6 million in fees. These loans, as they were forgiven, generated fee income of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, and $1.1 million and $0.3 million, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOur interest income could be reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest and fees will still accrue to income through normal GAAP accounting. Should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, we are unable to project the significance of such an impact, but recognize the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers' ability to repay in future periods.\nOur exposure to the hospitality industry at December 31, 2021 equated to approximately $418.6 million, or 14.9% of total portfolio loans. These were mostly loans secured by upscale or top tier flagged hotels, which have historically exhibited low leverage and strong operating cash flows. However, we anticipate that a significant portion of our borrowers in the hotel industry will continue to operate at occupancy levels at or below breakeven which has caused, or will cause, them to draw on their existing lines of credit with other financial institutions or other sources of liquidity and may adversely affect their ability to repay existing indebtedness. These developments, together with the current economic conditions generally, may adversely impact the value of real estate collateral in hospitality and other commercial real estate exposure. These risk considerations were factored into qualitative adjustments included in the ACL. As a result, we anticipate that our financial condition, capital levels and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRetail Operations\nThe Company continues to promote digital banking options through our website. Customers are encouraged to utilize online and mobile banking tools and our customer contact center for personal and automated telephone banking services. Retail branches are staffed and available to assist customers by offering lobby appointments, drive-up and virtual servicing.\nIn 2021 and, to date in 2022, we continued to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers by offering drive-up and appointment only services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail leadership continues to monitor branch traffic and local conditions daily and makes adjustments as needed. All branches are equipped with video conferencing and online tools that enable virtual servicing. We continue to pay all associates according to their normal work schedule, even if their hours were reduced and no associates were furloughed. Associates whose job responsibilities can be effectively carried out remotely are working from home. Associates whose critical duties require their continued presence on-site are utilizing personal protection equipment and observing social distancing and cleaning protocols.\nOur fee income for 2020 was negatively impacted due to COVID-19 by approximately $1.5 million. Beginning on July 20, 2020, certain account fees that were waived for customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were reinstated. In keeping with guidance from regulators, we actively worked with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to waive fees from a variety of sources, such as, but not limited to, insufficient funds and overdraft fees and account maintenance fees. As of December 31, 2021, we had no fee waivers specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these reductions in fees were temporary.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2021, all of the Company's capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. We believe the economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic improved during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nWe maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Funding sources accessible to the Company include borrowing availability at the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), equal to 25% of the Company's assets approximating $1.0 billion, subject to the amount of eligible collateral pledged, and of which $667.3 million remained available at December 31, 2021, federal funds unsecured lines with six other correspondent financial institutions in the amount of $145.0 million and access to the institutional CD market through brokered CDs. In addition to the above resources, the Company also has $743.8 million of unpledged available-for-sale securities as an additional source of liquidity at December 31, 2021. If an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.\nThe Company is monitoring and will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the potential risks and impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nEarnings Summary\n2021 Highlights\n\u2022Net interest income increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $111.2 million for the full year 2021 compared to $105.1 million for the full year 2020 primarily due to the enhanced return on restructured loan assets and collection of significant late fees on those loan assets, as well as a decline in funding costs during 2021.\n\u2022The provision for credit losses totaled $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $18.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Total noninterest income increased $2.3 million to $28.9 million for the full year 2021 compared to $26.6 million for the full year 2020.\n\u2022Total noninterest expense decreased $56.5 million to $102.3 million for the full year 2021 compared to $158.8 million for the full year 2020.\n\u2022Provision for income taxes increased $3.3 million to $4.1 million for the full year 2021 compared to $0.8 million for the full year 2020.\nWe reported net income of $31.6 million, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $45.9 million, or $1.74 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PERFORMANCE RATIOS </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.12) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Shareholders' Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>7.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.78) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Loans to Deposit Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>76.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>79.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nOur principal source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the average balance of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is managed by our Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d), in order to mitigate interest rate and liquidity risks of the balance sheet. A variety of ALCO strategies were implemented, within prescribed ALCO risk parameters, to produce what the Company believes is an acceptable level of net interest income.\nThe interest income on interest-earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using the applicable\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nfederal statutory tax rate of 21% for each period and the dividend-received deduction for equity securities. The Company believes this FTE presentation provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable sources of interest income.\nThe following table reconciles net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) to net interest income on an FTE basis for the periods presented:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>22,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,773 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income per Consolidated Statements of Net Income (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>111,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to FTE Basis </td> <td> </td> <td>1,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income (FTE) (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Margin </td> <td> </td> <td>2.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to FTE Basis </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income (FTE) (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>2.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balance Sheet and Net Interest Income Analysis (FTE)\nTotal net interest income increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $111.2 million in 2021, as compared to $105.1 million in 2020. Net interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased $5.2 million, or 4.8%, to $112.7 million in 2021 as compared to $107.5 million in 2020. The increase in net interest income, on an FTE basis, is driven by $13.1 million decrease in interest expense, offset by a $7.9 million decrease in interest income during 2021 as compared to 2020. The low interest rate environment and large commercial paydowns during 2021 has a negative impact on both net interest income and the net interest margin, but continues to be offset by a lower cost of funds as well as the positive impact of enhanced pricing on restructured loans and related late fees. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.80% in 2021 compared to 2.74% in 2020. The net interest margin, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased four basis points to 2.84% in 2021 compared to 2.80% in 2020, primarily due to the aforementioned enhanced return on restructured loan assets and the collection of related fees during 2021. The intentional runoff of higher cost CDs continues to drive the decline in the overall cost of funds.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7.

Interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), decreased $7.9 million, or 5.5%, for 2021 compared to 2020. The change was primarily due to increases in average interest-earning assets of $138.0 million for 2021, offset by a lower interest rate yield of 33 basis points compared to 2020. Average interest-bearing deposits with banks increased $90.0 million in 2021, and the average rate paid decreased 15 basis points for 2021 compared to 2020. Average loan balances decreased $38.6 million, primarily due to large commercial payoffs and loan sales, during 2021 compared to 2020, which included PPP loan production that began in the second quarter of 2020. Average PPP loans totaled $19.3 million during 2021. The average rate earned on loans decreased 13 basis points for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to lower short-term interest rates. Average investment securities increased $88.1 million and the average rate earned decreased 50 basis points for 2021 compared to 2020.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nInterest expense decreased $13.1 million for 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower short-term interest rates in 2021 as compared to 2020 in addition to the intentional runoff of higher cost CDs. Interest expense on deposits decreased $13.1 million for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the decline in the average balance of CDs. The decrease of $334.4 million or 18.4% in the average balance of CDs for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the aforementioned intentional runoff of these higher cost CDs. Money market and interest-bearing demand accounts increased $186.2 million and $92.7 million, respectively for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to our deposit acquisition strategy. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits decreased 45 basis points for 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the aforementioned intentional runoff of higher cost CDs and lower short-term interest rates. Overall, the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased 45 basis points for 2021 compared to 2020.\nThe following table sets forth for the periods presented a summary of the changes in interest

adequately absorb expected credit losses associated with the Company's financial instruments. Similarly, the Company recognizes provision expense for unfunded commitments based on the difference between the existing balance of reserves for unfunded commitments and the reserve balance for unfunded commitments necessary to adequately absorb expected credit losses associated with those commitments. The Company elected to defer its adoption of CECL in accordance with relief provided under the CARES Act and the adoption became effective January 1, 2021. At January 1, 2021, we increased the ACL by $64.5 million, which includes $61.6 million for the Day 1 CECL adjustment and $2.9 million\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nrelated to the life-of-loan reserve on unfunded loan commitments. The ACL as a percentage of total portfolio loans was 3.41% at December 31, 2021 and 1.83% at December 31, 2020.\nProvision expense decreased $14.6 million to $3.4 million for the year ended 2021 compared to $18.0 million for the year ended 2020. The decline in provision expense was because of increased qualitative loss factors as a result of the estimated economic impact of COVID-19 during 2020 and the relatively stable economy and improving COVID-19 conditions from the date of adoption through December 31, 2021.\nDuring 2021, management observed that $62.2 million of loans that were previously in the deferral program were recovering at rates much lower than peers. Accordingly, management sold all of these loans during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 after workout strategies had been exhausted.\nA release of $1.3 million was recorded in 2021 related to the provision for unfunded commitments. Per the guidance related to CECL, unfunded loan commitments are included as part of the provision for credit losses rather than noninterest expense, where it was previously recorded.\nNet charge-offs were $23.1 million for the full year 2021 compared to $2.7 million for the full year 2020. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily attributable to the resolution of five problem relationships during 2021, in which the majority of losses were anticipated and previously reserved. As a percentage of average portfolio loans, on an annualized basis, net charge-offs were 0.79% and 0.09% for the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. See the Allowance for Credit Losses\u201d section of this MD&A for additional details regarding our charge-offs.\nNonperforming loans ( NPLs\u201d) decreased significantly at December 31, 2021 by $24.6 million, or 76.9% to $7.4 million compared to $32.0 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the resolution of our largest NPL relationship during 2021 and a significant reduction of our second largest NPL relationship. NPLs as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 0.26% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.09% at December 31, 2020. See the Credit Quality\u201d section of this MD&A for more detail on our NPLs.\nDiscussion of net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7.

The above increases were offset by lower commercial loan swap fee income of $1.6 million and a decrease in OREO income of $0.3 million.

The decline was driven by the one-time charge resulting from goodwill impairment of $62.2 million recorded in the third quarter of 2020. Offsetting the decrease were increases of $2.2 million in losses on sales and write-downs of OREO, net primarily due to nonrecurring write-downs related to closed bank branches. There were also increases of $1.8 million in salaries and employee benefits, a $1.1 million increase in data processing expense and a $0.6 million increase in tax credit amortization. The increase in salaries and employee benefits was due to increased profit sharing incentives of $1.1 million and higher medical expenses of $1.7 million, offset by lower salaries of $1.3 million due to our branch network optimization project. Higher data processing expenses resulted from increased customer accounts and new modules added to our core processor and the increase in tax credit amortization was due to new historic tax credits entered into throughout 2021.\nDiscussion of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes increased $3.3 million to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $0.8 million for December 31, 2020. Pre-tax income increased $80.8 million for the year ended 2021 compared to 2020. A full goodwill impairment charge in the amount of $62.2 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2020. Our effective tax rate was 11.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to negative 1.7% for December 31, 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a higher level of pre-tax income and a lower level of tax-exempt interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the nondeductible goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company ordinarily generates an annual effective tax rate that is less than the statutory rate of 21% due to benefits resulting from tax-exempt interest income, tax credit projects and Bank Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d), which are relatively consistent regardless of the level of pre-tax income.\nDiscussion of provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 has been omitted as such discussion was provided in Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis,\u201d under the heading Provision for Income Taxes\u201d in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on March 12, 2021, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nFinancial Condition\nDecember 31, 2021\nTotal assets of $4.1 billion decreased $45.4 million, or 1.1%, from December 31, 2020. Total portfolio loans at December 31, 2021 were $2.8 billion, decreasing $135.0 million, or 4.6%, year over year. We experienced a decline in total loans during 2021 primarily due to large commercial loan payoffs of approximately $312.3 million, $62.2 million of loan sales and mortgage refinancing sold in the secondary markets. The variances between loan segments for portfolio loans are also related to the adoption of Topic 326. See the impact of Topic 326 in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We made changes to our loan portfolio segments to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance under CECL. The new segmentation breaks out an Other category from the original loan categories, which applies only to the current year 2021 and was not applied to periods during 2020 and prior years, therefore showing fluctuations in all categories. At January 1, 2021, the initial break-out of Other loans related to the adoption of Topic 326 totaled $379.9 million consisting of $140.8 million of Commercial Real Estate, ( CRE\u201d), $78.1 million of Commercial and Industrial ( C&I\u201d), $50.8 million of Residential Mortgages and $110.2 million of Construction. This segment of loans has unique risk attributes considered inconsistent with current underwriting standards. The analysis applied to this segment resulted in an expected credit loss of $51.3 million at adoption. Loans held-for-sale were $0.2 million at December 31, 2021 a decrease of $25.2 million over prior year.\nThe Company's investment portfolio increased $143.7 million, or 18.5%, from December 31, 2020. Deposits increased $13.8 million from December 31, 2020 primarily due to our core deposits offset by the runoff of higher cost CDs and $84.7 million of deposits held-for-assumption in connection with the sale of four bank branches, which were completed during the second quarter of 2021. Shareholders' equity at December 31, 2021 was $407.6 million, a $32.6 million or 7.4% decrease from $440.2 million at December 31, 2020.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7.

a taxable-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent.\n(2) Securities not due at a single maturity date\nAt December 31, 2021 the Company had no held-to-maturity securities; however, if at a future date we classify securities as held-to-maturity, our disclosures will show the weighted average yield for each range of maturities.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company held 52% fixed rate and 48% floating rate securities. The floating rate securities may have a stated maturity greater than ten years, but the interest rate generally adjusts monthly. Therefore, the duration on these securities is short, generally less than one year, and will therefore not be as sensitive to interest rate changes.\nRefer to Note 4, Investment Securities, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our securities.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

The risk that borrowers are unable to pay such obligations is inherent in the loan portfolio. Other conditions such as downturns in the borrower's industry or the overall economic climate can significantly impact the borrower's ability to pay.\nTotal portfolio loans decreased $135.0 million, or 4.6% to $2.8 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2020. We experienced a decline in total loans during 2021 primarily due to large commercial loan payoffs, $62.2 million of loan sales and mortgage refinancing sold in the secondary markets. The variances between loan segments for portfolio loans also relates to the adoption of Topic 326 as we adjusted our loan portfolio segments to align with the methodology applied in determining the allowance under CECL.\nThe commercial portfolio is monitored for potential concentrations of credit risk by market, loan type, property type and tenants.\nOur exposure to the hospitality industry at December 31, 2021 equated to approximately $418.6 million, or 14.9% of total portfolio loans. These were mostly loans secured by upscale or top tier flagged hotels, which have historically exhibited low leverage and strong operating cash flows. Beginning in the second quarter of 2021, we observed improvements in occupancy and the average daily rates for our hotel clients following sharp declines throughout the pandemic. However, like many service industries our clients continue to face challenges with respect to labor, which impedes their ability to turnover rooms resulting in occupancy constraints. This has caused, or may cause, them to operate with lower levels of liquidity and an inability to reserve for capital improvements and may adversely affect their ability to pay property expenses, capital improvements and/or repay existing indebtedness. Contractual payments have been restored since the expiration of our deferral program on June 30, 2021. These developments, together with the current economic conditions, generally, may adversely impact the value of real estate collateral in hospitality and other commercial real estate exposure. As a result, our financial condition, capital levels and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAggregate commitments to our top 10 credit relationships were $721.6 million at December 31, 2021.

certain special mention and substandard loans within prescribed policy thresholds. These loans typically represent the highest risk of loss to the Company. Action plans are established and these loans are monitored through regular contact with the borrower and loan officer, review of current financial information and other documentation, review of all loan or potential loan restructures or modifications and the regular re-evaluation of assets held as collateral.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Credit Risk Committee of the Board meets to review our loan portfolio metrics, approve segment limits, approve the adequacy of ACL, and findings from Loan Review identified in the previous quarter. Annually, this same committee approves credit related policies and policy enhancements as they become available.\nAdditional credit risk management practices include continuous reviews of our lending policies and procedures to support sound underwriting practices, concentrations, delinquencies and annual portfolio stress testing. Our Loan Review department serves as a mechanism to individually monitor credit quality and assess the effectiveness of credit risk management practices to provide oversight of all lending activities. The loan review function has the primary responsibility for assessing commercial credit administration and credit decision functions of consumer and mortgage underwriting, as well as providing input to the loan risk rating process. Our policy is to place loans in all categories in nonaccrual status when collection of interest or principal is doubtful, or generally when interest or principal payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms. Consumer unsecured loans and secured loans are evaluated for charge-off after the loan becomes 90 days past due. Unsecured loans are fully charged-off and secured loans are charged-off to the estimated fair value of the collateral less the cost to sell.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7.

The two largest NPL relationships had an aggregate principal balance of $21.4 million at December 31, 2020. We recognized charge-offs totaling $8.2 million related to these relationships during the second quarter of 2021 resulting in the release of $4.8 million of individually evaluated loan reserves. The $8.2 million in charge-offs consisted of a $6.3 million charge-off triggered by a settlement of the debt and proceeds received while the remaining $1.9 million charge-off was triggered by the sale of the underlying collateral through a purchase agreement approved by the bankruptcy court. Nonperforming construction loans decreased primarily due to paydowns from borrower asset sales on four loans related to one relationship during the fourth quarter of 2021. Paydowns on this relationship totaled $2.4 million and charge-offs totaled $1.9 million leaving a remaining book balance of $0.8 million that is adequately secured by collateral. Offsetting the declines were new NPLs totaling $2.8 million, of which $2.7 million is one loan. NPLs as a percentage of total portfolio loans were 0.26% at December 31, 2021 compared to 1.09% at December 31, 2020.\nOREO decreased $4.8 million, or 30.6%, at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 due to the sale of 23 branches and six OREO properties during 2021. Closed retail bank office carrying values decreased $1.5 million and have a remaining book value of $1.0 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $2.5 million at December 31, 2020. During 2021, 20 branch closures were completed and 16 of these were sold as part of our branch network optimization project that aligns with our strategic goals to enhance franchise value and improve operating efficiency.\nThere were no nonaccrual loans related to loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020 total nonaccrual loans include $7 thousand in loans held-for-sale in connection with sale of Bank branches.\nRefer to Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our nonperforming loans and OREO.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

There were no loans during the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 that were past due more than 90 days and still accruing.\nClosed-end installment loans, amortizing loans secured by real estate and any other loans with payments scheduled monthly are reported past due when the borrower is in arrears two or more monthly payments. Other multi-payment obligations with payments scheduled other than monthly are reported past due when one scheduled payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more. We monitor delinquency on a monthly basis, including loans that are at risk for becoming delinquent and early stage delinquencies in order to identify emerging patterns and potential problem loans.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring ( TDRs\u201d) are loans that we, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower's financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise grant. The Company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify terms and conditions before their loan defaults and/or is transferred to nonaccrual status. Modified terms that might be considered a TDR generally include extension of maturity dates at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar characteristics, reductions in contractual interest rates or principal deferment. While unusual, there may be instances of principal forgiveness. Short-term modifications that are considered insignificant are generally not considered a TDR unless there are other concessions granted.\nAn accruing loan that is characterized as a TDR can remain in accrual status if, based on a current credit analysis, collection of principal and interest in accordance with the modified terms is reasonably assured, and the borrower has demonstrated sustained historical performance for a reasonable period before the modification. All TDRs are considered to be impaired loans and will be reported as impaired loans for their remaining lives, unless a subsequent restructuring includes an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate that would be accepted at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk, we fully expect that the remaining principal and interest will be collected according to the restructured agreement or the contractual terms of the original loan agreement are restored. Generally, the Company individually evaluates all impaired loans, which includes TDRs, with a commitment greater than or equal to $1.0 million for Individually Evaluated Loan reserves. In addition, the Company may evaluate credits that have complex loan structures for impairment, even if the balance is less than $1.0 million. Nonaccrual TDRs can be returned to accruing status if the ultimate collectability of all contractual amounts due, according to the restructured agreement, is not in doubt and there is a period of a minimum of six months of satisfactory payment performance by the borrower either immediately before or after the restructuring.\nAs an example, consider a substandard commercial construction loan that is currently 90 days past due where the loan is restructured to extend the maturity date for a period longer than would be considered an insignificant period of time. The post-modification interest rate given to the borrower is considered to be lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk and all other terms remain the same according to the original loan agreement. This loan will be considered a TDR as the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and a concession has been granted due to the significant extension, resulting in payment delay as well as the rate being lower than current market rate for new debt with similar risk. The loan will be reported\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nas a nonaccrual TDR and an impaired loan. In addition, the loan could be charged down to the fair value of the collateral if a confirmed loss exists. If the loan subsequently performs, by means of making on-time payments according to the newly restructured terms for a period of six months, and it is expected that all remaining principal and interest will be collected according to the terms of the restructured agreement, the loan will be returned to accrual status and reported as an accruing TDR. The loan will remain an impaired loan for the remaining life of the loan because the interest rate was not adjusted to be equal to or greater than the rate that would be accepted at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe following summarizes our allowance for credit loss experience at December 31 for each of the years presented:\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance Beginning of Year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,074 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,199 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of CECL Adoption </td> <td> </td> <td>61,642 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Credit Losses </td> <td> </td> <td>3,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,404 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td>19,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Mortgages </td> <td> </td> <td>273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td>2,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,401 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>1,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>393 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td>24,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,082 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Real Estate </td> <td> </td> <td>159 </td> <td> </td> <td>707 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial and Industrial </td> <td> </td> <td>291 </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential Mortgages </td> <td> </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td>586 </td> <td> </td> <td>737 </td> <td> </td> <td>602 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td>630 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Recoveries </td> <td> </td> <td>1,297 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,661 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,241 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Net Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td>23,127 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,694 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,841 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance End of Year </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,939 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,074 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,762 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Charge-offs to Average Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.79% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.13% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.83% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal net charge-offs increased to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily in the commercial real estate segment.

Loan risk ratings are assigned based upon the creditworthiness of the borrower and are reviewed on an ongoing basis according to our internal policies. Loans rated special mention or substandard have potential or well-defined weaknesses not generally found in high quality, performing loans, and require attention from management to limit loss.\nThe following table summarizes the credit quality ratios and their components as of December 31 for the years presented below:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>2,812,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,947,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.83 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming Loans to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>2,812,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,947,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming Loans to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.09 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Nonperforming Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,074 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>7,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,004 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Nonperforming Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>1,297.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>168.96 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Charge-offs to Average Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Charge-offs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,694 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>2,927,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,959,376 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Charge-offs to Average Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.79 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.09 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA discussion of the factors that drove the material changes in the ACL ratios presented in the table above, such as the significant reduction in nonperforming loans and the significant increase in net charge-offs have been communicated in the paragraphs preceding this table within the Credit Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses sections within this MD&A.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

The investment is carried at cost and evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value. We hold FHLB stock because we are a member of the FHLB of Atlanta. The FHLB requires members to purchase and hold a specified level of FHLB stock based upon the members' asset values, level of borrowings and participation in other programs offered. Stock in the FHLB is non-marketable and is redeemable at the discretion of the FHLB. Members do not purchase stock in the FHLB for the same reasons that traditional equity investors acquire stock in an investor-owned enterprise. Rather, members purchase stock to obtain access to the products and services offered by the FHLB. Unlike equity securities of traditional for-profit enterprises, the stock of the FHLB does not provide its holders with an opportunity for capital appreciation because, by regulation, FHLB stock can only be purchased, redeemed and transferred at par value.\nRefer to Note 13, Federal Home Loan Bank Borrowings, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our borrowings.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

The decrease was primarily due to the $50.7 million cumulative-effect adjustment related to the adoption of Topic 326, a $14.0 million, net of tax, decrease in other comprehensive loss due to changes in the fair value of available-for-\nsale securities and $0.5 million related to the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by net income of $31.6 million. The remaining difference of $1.0 million is related to stock-based compensation during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company continues to maintain its capital position with a leverage ratio of 10.62% as compared to the regulatory guideline of 5.00% to be well-capitalized and a risk-based Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 14.21% compared to the regulatory guideline of 6.50% to be well-capitalized. Our risk-based Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios were 14.21% and 15.46%, respectively, which places the Company above the federal bank regulatory agencies' well-capitalized guidelines of 8.00% and 10.00%, respectively. We believe that we have the ability to raise additional capital, if necessary.\nIn July 2013 the federal banking agencies issued a final rule to implement the Basel III Final Rules and the minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule established a comprehensive capital framework and went into effect on January 1, 2015 for smaller banking organizations such as the Company. The rule also requires the Company and the Bank to maintain a capital conservation buffer composed of Common Equity Tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2.50% of total risk-weighted assets beginning in 2019. The capital conservation buffer was phased-in, in equal increments from 2016 through 2019. As a result, starting in 2019, the Company and the Bank were required to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio greater than 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio greater than 8.5%, and a Total risk-based capital ratio greater than 10.5%; otherwise, they will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.\nFederal regulators periodically propose amendments to the regulatory capital rules and the related regulatory framework and consider changes to the capital standards that could significantly increase the amount of capital needed to meet applicable standards. The timing of adoption, ultimate form and effect of any such proposed amendments cannot be predicted.\nThe community bank leverage ratio final rule was effective on January 1, 2020 and allows qualifying community banking organizations to calculate a leverage ratio to measure capital adequacy. Qualifying banking organizations that have less than $10 billion total assets, a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, and meet other criteria such as off-balance sheet exposures and trading assets limits. Banks opting into this framework are not required to calculate or report risk-based capital. We did not adopt this framework; therefore, capital ratios are calculated and reported as detailed above.\nRefer to Note 21, Capital Adequacy, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our capital.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

Purchase obligations primarily represent obligations under agreement with a third-party data processing vendor and communications charges.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Company offers our customers lines of credit and letters of credit to meet their financing objectives. The undrawn or unfunded portion of these facilities do not represent outstanding balances and therefore are not reflected in our financial statements as loans receivable. The Company provides lines of credit to our clients to memorialize the commitment to finance the completion of construction projects and revolving lines of credit to operating companies to finance their working capital needs. Lines of credit for construction projects represent $283.9 million, or 55.3% and $391.4 million, or 66.2% of the commitments to extend credit identified in the table below at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The Company provides letters of credit, generally, for the benefit or our customers to provide assurance to various municipalities that construction projects will be completed according to approved plans and specifications. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest rate risk and our exposure to credit loss, in the event the customer does not satisfy the terms of the agreement, could be equal to the contractual amount of the obligation less the value of any collateral. The Company analyzes this risk and calculates a reserve for unfunded commitments. The same credit policies are applied in granting these facilities as those used for underwriting loans. Lines of credit to finance construction projects include a construction end date, at which time the loan is expected to convert to a mini-perm loan. A department independent of our lending group monitors construction commitments of $1.0 million or more. Lines of credit to operating companies to finance working capital include a maturity date and may include various financial covenants. Letters of credit include an expiration date unless it is a standby letter of credit which automatically renews but generally provide for a termination clause on an annual basis given sufficient notice to the beneficiary. The Company typically charges an annual fee for the issuance of letters of credit. Because letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon, these commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company.\nThe following table sets forth the commitments and letters of credit as of December 31:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to Extend Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>513,482 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>591,175 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby Letters of Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>27,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>540,565 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>620,468 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimates of the fair value of these off-balance sheet items were not made because of the short-term nature of these arrangements and the credit standing of the counterparties.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is defined as a financial institution's ability to meet its cash and collateral obligations at a reasonable cost. This includes the ability to satisfy the financial needs of depositors who want to withdraw funds or borrowers needing to access funds to meet their credit needs. In order to manage liquidity risk the Company's Board has delegated authority to the ALCO for formulation, implementation and oversight of liquidity risk management for the Company. The ALCO's goal is to maintain adequate levels of liquidity at a reasonable cost to meet funding needs in both a normal operating environment and for potential liquidity stress events. The ALCO monitors and manages liquidity through various ratios, reviewing cash flow projections, performing stress tests and by having a detailed contingency funding plan. The ALCO policy guidelines define graduated risk tolerance levels. If our liquidity position moves to a level that has been defined as high risk, specific actions are required, such as increased monitoring or the development of an action plan to reduce the risk position.\nOur primary funding and liquidity source is a stable customer deposit base. Management believes that we have the ability to retain existing deposits and attract new deposits, mitigating any funding dependency on other more volatile sources. Although deposits are the primary source of funds, the Company has identified various other funding sources that can be used as part of our normal funding program when either a structure or cost efficiency has been identified. Additional funding sources accessible to the Company include borrowing availability at the FHLB, equal to 25% of the Company's assets approximating $1.0 billion, subject to the amount of eligible collateral pledged, federal funds lines with six other correspondent financial institutions in the amount of $145.0 million, access to the institutional CD market, and the brokered deposit market. In addition to the lines referenced above, the Company also has $743.8 million of unpledged available-for-sale investment securities as an additional source of liquidity.\nAn important component of our ability to effectively respond to potential liquidity stress events is maintaining a cushion of highly liquid assets. Highly liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly, with little or no loss in value, to meet financial obligations. ALCO policy guidelines define a ratio of highly liquid assets to total assets by graduated risk tolerance levels of minimal, moderate and high. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had $985.1 million in highly liquid assets, which consisted of $64.9 million in interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, $176.2 million in FRB Excess Reserves, $743.8 million in unpledged securities and $0.2 million in mortgage loans held-for-sale. This resulted in highly liquid assets to total assets ratio of 23.8% at December 31, 2021.\nIf an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.\nThe following table provides detail of liquidity sources as of December 31:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and Due From Banks </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,535 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Bearing Deposits in Other Financial Institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>64,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal Reserve Bank Excess Reserves </td> <td> </td> <td>176,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,453 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpledged Investment Securities </td> <td> </td> <td>743,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>632,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess Pledged Securities </td> <td> </td> <td>28,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB Borrowing Availability </td> <td> </td> <td>667,307 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>510,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured Lines of Credit </td> <td> </td> <td>145,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity Sources </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,862,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,538,056 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nInflation\nManagement is aware of the significant effect inflation has on interest rates and can have on financial performance. The Company's ability to cope with this is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing interest rates and its ability to manage noninterest income and expense. The mix of interest-rate sensitive assets and liabilities is monitored through ALCO in order to reduce the impact of inflation on net interest income. The effects of inflation are controlled by reviewing the prices of our products and services, by introducing new products and services and by controlling overhead expenses. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than the effects of general levels of inflation.\nStock Repurchase Plan\nOn December 13, 2021, the Company authorized, effective December 10, 2021, a common stock repurchase program to purchase up to two million shares of the Company's common stock in the aggregate over a period of twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, 30,407 shares of common stock had been repurchased under this program at an average price of $15.22 per share.\nThe specific timing, price and quantity of repurchases will be at our discretion and will depend on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the trading price of common stock, legal and contractual requirements, applicable securities laws and the Company's financial performance. The repurchase plan does not obligate us to repurchase any particular number of shares.\nThe Stock Repurchase Plan is also described in Item 5, Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Carter Bankshares, Inc., our operations, and our present business environment. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A includes the following sections:\n\u2022Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Our Business\n\u2022Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\u2022Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Liquidity\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Stock Repurchase Program\nThis section reviews our financial condition for each of the past two years and results of operations for each of the past three years. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current period presentation. Some tables may include additional time periods to illustrate trends within our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. The results of operations reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.\nExplanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States, management uses, and this annual report references, adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent, or ( FTE\u201d), basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying business, operational performance and performance trends as it facilitates comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial services industry. The Company believes the presentation of net interest income on an FTE basis ensures the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) is reconciled to net interest income adjusted to an FTE basis in the Net Interest Income section of the \"Results of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2021.\"\nAlthough management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances investors' understanding of our business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more relevant than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Over time, these estimates, assumptions and judgments may prove to be inaccurate or vary from actual results and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the periods presented or in future periods. We currently view the determination of the allowance for credit losses to be critical, because it is made in accordance with GAAP, is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management and have had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting estimates:\nAllowance for Credit Losses ( ACL\u201d)\nThe ACL represents an amount which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb expected credit losses on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and prepayment experience. The ACL is measured and recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. The ACL is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries of previous losses, and is increased or decreased by a provision for credit losses, which is recorded as a current period operating expense.\nDetermination of an appropriate ACL is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. The reasonableness of the ACL is reviewed quarterly by management.\nManagement believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the ACL and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the ACL requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio can vary from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected credit losses, future additions to the ACL may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes to the interest rate environment which may directly impact prepayment and curtailment rate assumptions, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nThe ACL base case\u201d model is derived from various economic forecasts provided by widely recognized sources. Management evaluates the variability of market conditions by examining the peak and trough of economic cycles. These peaks and troughs are used to stress the base case model to develop a range of potential outcomes. Management then determines the appropriate reserve through an evaluation of these various outcomes relative to current economic conditions and known risks in the portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2021 the range of outcomes would produce a 17% reduction or a 27% increase in reserves based on the best and worst case scenarios, respectively.\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL and Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business\nCarter Bankshares, Inc. (the Company\u201d) is a bank holding company headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia with assets of $4.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company is the parent company of its wholly owned subsidiary, Carter Bank & Trust (the Bank\u201d). The Bank is an insured, Virginia state-chartered bank, which operates branches in Virginia and North Carolina. The Company provides a full range of financial services with retail, and commercial banking products and insurance. Per the 2020 Annual Report of the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, our Company continues to be the fourth largest state-chartered bank by asset size at year end 2020. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CARE.\u201d\nThe Company earns revenue primarily from interest on loans and securities and fees charged for financial services provided to our customers. The Company incurs expenses for the cost of deposits, provision for credit losses and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy and tax expense.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nOur mission is that the Company strives to be the preferred lifetime financial partner for our customers and shareholders, and the employer of choice in the communities the Company is privileged to serve. Our strategic plan focuses on restructuring the balance sheet to provide more diversification and higher yielding assets to increase the net interest margin. Another area of focus is the transformation of the infrastructure of the Company to provide a foundation for operational efficiency and provide new products and services for our customers that will ultimately increase noninterest income.\nOur focus continues to be on loan and deposit growth with a shift in the composition of deposits to more low cost core deposits with less dependence in higher cost certificates of deposits ( CDs\u201d), as well as, implementing opportunities to increase fee income while closely monitoring our operating expenses. The Company is focused on executing this strategy to successfully build our brand and grow our business in our markets.\nThe Company's Response to COVID-19\nLending Operations\nThe Company elected to take advantage of Section 4014 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) provision to temporarily delay adoption of the CECL methodology. The Company was subject to the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) accounting method under the FASB ASU 2016-03 and related amendments, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020 and has since implemented CECL on January 1, 2021. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures relating to CECL in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company quickly responded to the pandemic and the CARES Act, offering the option of payment deferrals, participation in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), fee waivers and other relief actions to customers. In 2021 and, to date in 2022, we continued to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers by taking precautions to protect both customers and associates through enhanced cleaning services, social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements for both. A portion of the Company's workforce continues to work remotely.\nUnder the CARES Act, the PPP is an amendment to a program administered as part of the Small Business Administration's ( SBA\u201d)'s 7-A loan program. The Bank became an approved SBA 7-A lender in November 2019. The PPP is a guaranteed, unsecured loan program created to fund certain payroll and operating costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, $349 billion was approved and designated for the PPP in order for the SBA to guarantee 100% of collective loans made under the program to eligible small businesses, nonprofits, veteran's organizations, and tribal businesses. The Company participated in the initial round of funding through a referral relationship with a third-party, non-bank lender. When an additional $310 billion in funds were approved and designated for the PPP, we opted to set up an internal, automated loan process utilizing our core system provider.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d) implemented a liquidity facility available to financial institutions participating in the PPP. However, we opted to fund all PPP loans through our internal liquidity sources. These loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and do not represent a credit risk. The vast majority of these PPP loans have been forgiven.\nThe Bank provided loan payment deferrals to customers under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and regulatory interagency guidance regarding loan modifications. The Bank launched successive deferral programs with short-term expirations. The Part I program was launched on March 23, 2020 and expired on August 31, 2020. The deferrals in Part I provided for deferral of principal and up to the deferral of principal and interest, if requested through the expiry. The Part II program extended deferrals through December 31, 2020 subject to the collection of updated financial information and validation of need. For these borrowers the Bank requested verification of business and/or guarantor liquidity to ascertain the viability of the business in a post-pandemic environment. Prior to the extension of the CARES Act, the Bank launched the Part III program, which offered borrowers in the Part II program an extension of deferrals through June 30, 2021. Borrowers who opted into the Part III program were required to provide monthly financial statements and remit payments on a quarterly basis equal to the lesser of: i) 90% of free cash flow (EBITDA) or, ii) the otherwise contractual payment ( recapture payment\u201d). Following the expiration of the deferral programs on June 30, 2021, for term loans, payments were applied to accrued interest first and once accrued interest is current, payments will be applied to principal. Deferred principal will be due at maturity. For interest only loans, such as lines of credit, deferred interest will be due at maturity. Cumulative deferred interest totaled $12.0 million as of June 30, 2021, but declined to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2021.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nThe Bank also participated in the PPP established by the CARES Act. During the first round of PPP, we approved 451 loans that were referred to an online small business lender, totaling $17.9 million. Through the second round we had approved 515 loan applications totaling $39.9 million through our internal lending program, of which 498 loans totaling $38.5 million have been fully forgiven by the SBA. The $57.8 million in PPP loans originated during the first two rounds of PPP generated $1.5 million in fees, which have been, or will be, recognized in income as loans are forgiven, or over the remaining life of the loan for any portion that is not forgiven. On December 22, 2020 Congress passed legislation that was signed into law on December 27, 2020, making available a third round of PPP funding. We provided access to the program through our internal lending program for our current business customers. As of December 31, 2021, we had approved 136 loan applications totaling $11.0 million, of which 125 loans totaling $9.8 million have been fully forgiven by the SBA and generated an additional $0.6 million in fees. These loans, as they were forgiven, generated fee income of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, and $1.1 million and $0.3 million, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOur interest income could be reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interest and fees will still accrue to income through normal GAAP accounting. Should eventual credit losses on these deferred payments emerge, interest income and fees accrued would need to be reversed. In such a scenario, interest income in future periods could be negatively impacted. At this time, we are unable to project the significance of such an impact, but recognize the breadth of the economic impact may affect our borrowers' ability to repay in future periods.\nOur exposure to the hospitality industry at December 31, 2021 equated to approximately $418.6 million, or 14.9% of total portfolio loans. These were mostly loans secured by upscale or top tier flagged hotels, which have historically exhibited low leverage and strong operating cash flows. However, we anticipate that a significant portion of our borrowers in the hotel industry will continue to operate at occupancy levels at or below breakeven which has caused, or will cause, them to draw on their existing lines of credit with other financial institutions or other sources of liquidity and may adversely affect their ability to repay existing indebtedness. These developments, together with the current economic conditions generally, may adversely impact the value of real estate collateral in hospitality and other commercial real estate exposure. These risk considerations were factored into qualitative adjustments included in the ACL. As a result, we anticipate that our financial condition, capital levels and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRetail Operations\nThe Company continues to promote digital banking options through our website. Customers are encouraged to utilize online and mobile banking tools and our customer contact center for personal and automated telephone banking services. Retail branches are staffed and available to assist customers by offering lobby appointments, drive-up and virtual servicing.\nIn 2021 and, to date in 2022, we continued to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers by offering drive-up and appointment only services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Retail leadership continues to monitor branch traffic and local conditions daily and makes adjustments as needed. All branches are equipped with video conferencing and online tools that enable virtual servicing. We continue to pay all associates according to their normal work schedule, even if their hours were reduced and no associates were furloughed. Associates whose job responsibilities can be effectively carried out remotely are working from home. Associates whose critical duties require their continued presence on-site are utilizing personal protection equipment and observing social distancing and cleaning protocols.\nOur fee income for 2020 was negatively impacted due to COVID-19 by approximately $1.5 million. Beginning on July 20, 2020, certain account fees that were waived for customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic were reinstated. In keeping with guidance from regulators, we actively worked with customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to waive fees from a variety of sources, such as, but not limited to, insufficient funds and overdraft fees and account maintenance fees. As of December 31, 2021, we had no fee waivers specific to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe these reductions in fees were temporary.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2021, all of the Company's capital ratios were in excess of all regulatory requirements. We believe the economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic improved during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nWe maintain access to multiple sources of liquidity. Funding sources accessible to the Company include borrowing availability at the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d), equal to 25% of the Company's assets approximating $1.0 billion, subject to the amount of eligible collateral pledged, and of which $667.3 million remained available at December 31, 2021, federal funds unsecured lines with six other correspondent financial institutions in the amount of $145.0 million and access to the institutional CD market through brokered CDs. In addition to the above resources, the Company also has $743.8 million of unpledged available-for-sale securities as an additional source of liquidity at December 31, 2021. If an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.\nThe Company is monitoring and will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the potential risks and impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nEarnings Summary\n2021 Highlights\n\u2022Net interest income increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $111.2 million for the full year 2021 compared to $105.1 million for the full year 2020 primarily due to the enhanced return on restructured loan assets and collection of significant late fees on those loan assets, as well as a decline in funding costs during 2021.\n\u2022The provision for credit losses totaled $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $18.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Total noninterest income increased $2.3 million to $28.9 million for the full year 2021 compared to $26.6 million for the full year 2020.\n\u2022Total noninterest expense decreased $56.5 million to $102.3 million for the full year 2021 compared to $158.8 million for the full year 2020.\n\u2022Provision for income taxes increased $3.3 million to $4.1 million for the full year 2021 compared to $0.8 million for the full year 2020.\nWe reported net income of $31.6 million, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $45.9 million, or $1.74 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nNet Interest Income\nOur principal source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the average balance of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is managed by our Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d), in order to mitigate interest rate and liquidity risks of the balance sheet. A variety of ALCO strategies were implemented, within prescribed ALCO risk parameters, to produce what the Company believes is an acceptable level of net interest income.\nThe interest income on interest-earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using the applicable\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nfederal statutory tax rate of 21% for each period and the dividend-received deduction for equity securities. The Company believes this FTE presentation provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable sources of interest income.\nThe following table reconciles net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) to net interest income on an FTE basis for the periods presented:\n\nAverage Balance Sheet and Net Interest Income Analysis (FTE)\nTotal net interest income increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $111.2 million in 2021, as compared to $105.1 million in 2020. Net interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased $5.2 million, or 4.8%, to $112.7 million in 2021 as compared to $107.5 million in 2020. The increase in net interest income, on an FTE basis, is driven by $13.1 million decrease in interest expense, offset by a $7.9 million decrease in interest income during 2021 as compared to 2020. The low interest rate environment and large commercial paydowns during 2021 has a negative impact on both net interest income and the net interest margin, but continues to be offset by a lower cost of funds as well as the positive impact of enhanced pricing on restructured loans and related late fees. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.80% in 2021 compared to 2.74% in 2020. The net interest margin, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased four basis points to 2.84% in 2021 compared to 2.80% in 2020, primarily due to the aforementioned enhanced return on restructured loan assets and the collection of related fees during 2021. The intentional runoff of higher cost CDs continues to drive the decline in the overall cost of funds.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand Carter Bankshares, Inc., our operations, and our present business environment. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A includes the following sections:\n\u2022Explanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\u2022Our Business\n\u2022Results of Operations and Financial Condition\n\u2022Capital Resources\n\u2022Contractual Obligations\n\u2022Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022Liquidity\n\u2022Inflation\n\u2022Stock Repurchase Program\nThis section reviews our financial condition for each of the past two years and results of operations for each of the past three years. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to place them on a basis comparable with the current period presentation. Some tables may include additional time periods to illustrate trends within our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. The results of operations reported in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods.\nExplanation of Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the United States, management uses, and this annual report references, adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent, or ( FTE\u201d), basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure provides information useful to investors in understanding our underlying business, operational performance and performance trends as it facilitates comparisons with the performance of other companies in the financial services industry. The Company believes the presentation of net interest income on an FTE basis ensures the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice. Net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) is reconciled to net interest income adjusted to an FTE basis in the Net Interest Income section of the \"Results of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2021.\"\nAlthough management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances investors' understanding of our business and performance, this non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered an alternative to GAAP or considered to be more relevant than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable with similar non-GAAP measures which may be presented by other companies.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company's preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Over time, these estimates, assumptions and judgments may prove to be inaccurate or vary from actual results and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the periods presented or in future periods. We currently view the determination of the allowance for credit losses to be critical, because it is made in accordance with GAAP, is highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management and have had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified the following critical accounting estimates:\nAllowance for Credit Losses ( ACL\u201d)\nThe ACL represents an amount which, in management's judgment, is adequate to absorb expected credit losses on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and prepayment experience. The ACL is measured and recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. The ACL is reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries of previous losses, and is increased or decreased by a provision for credit losses, which is recorded as a current period operating expense.\nDetermination of an appropriate ACL is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. The reasonableness of the ACL is reviewed quarterly by management.\nManagement believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the ACL and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the ACL requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected credit losses in the loan portfolio can vary from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected credit losses, future additions to the ACL may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes to the interest rate environment which may directly impact prepayment and curtailment rate assumptions, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.\nThe ACL base case\u201d model is derived from various economic forecasts provided by widely recognized sources. Management evaluates the variability of market conditions by examining the peak and trough of economic cycles. These peaks and troughs are used to stress the base case model to develop a range of potential outcomes. Management then determines the appropriate reserve through an evaluation of these various outcomes relative to current economic conditions and known risks in the portfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2021 the range of outcomes would produce a 17% reduction or a 27% increase in reserves based on the best and worst case scenarios, respectively.\nRefer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the ACL and Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Business\nCarter Bankshares, Inc. (the Company\u201d) is a bank holding company headquartered in Martinsville, Virginia with assets of $4.1 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company is the parent company of its wholly owned subsidiary, Carter Bank & Trust (the Bank\u201d). The Bank is an insured, Virginia state-chartered bank, which operates branches in Virginia and North Carolina. The Company provides a full range of financial services with retail, and commercial banking products and insurance. Per the 2020 Annual Report of the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, our Company continues to be the fourth largest state-chartered bank by asset size at year end 2020. Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CARE.\u201d\nThe Company earns revenue primarily from interest on loans and securities and fees charged for financial services provided to our customers. The Company incurs expenses for the cost of deposits, provision for credit losses and other operating costs such as salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy and tax expense.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - (continued)\nOur mission is that the Company strives to be the preferred lifetime financial partner for our customers and shareholders, and the employer of choice in the communities the Company is privileged to serve. Our strategic plan focuses on restructuring the balance sheet to provide more diversification and higher yielding assets to increase the net interest margin. Another area of focus is the transformation of the infrastructure of the Company to provide a foundation for operational efficiency and provide new products and services for our customers that will ultimately increase noninterest income.\nOur focus continues to be on loan and deposit growth with a shift in the composition of deposits to more low cost core deposits with less dependence in higher cost certificates of deposits ( CDs\u201d), as well as, implementing opportunities to increase fee income while closely monitoring our operating expenses. The Company is focused on executing this strategy to successfully build our brand and grow our business in our markets.\nThe Company's Response to COVID-19\nLending Operations\nThe Company elected to take advantage of Section 4014 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) provision to temporarily delay adoption of the CECL methodology. The Company was subject to the adoption of the Current Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) accounting method under the FASB ASU 2016-03 and related amendments, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020 and has since implemented CECL on January 1, 2021. Refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosures relating to CECL in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Company quickly responded to the pandemic and the CARES Act, offering the option of payment deferrals, participation in the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d), fee waivers and other relief actions to customers. In 2021 and, to date in 2022, we continued to prioritize the safety of our associates and customers by taking precautions to protect both customers and associates through enhanced cleaning services, social distancing and personal protective equipment requirements for both. A portion of the Company's workforce continues to work remotely.\nUnder the CARES Act, the PPP is an amendment to a program administered as part of the Small Business Administration's ( SBA\u201d)'s 7-A loan program. The Bank became an approved SBA 7-A lender in November 2019. The PPP is a guaranteed, unsecured loan program created to fund certain payroll and operating costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, $349 billion was approved and designated for the PPP in order for the SBA to guarantee 100% of collective loans made under the program to eligible small businesses, nonprofits, veteran's organizations, and tribal businesses. The Company participated in the initial round of funding through a referral relationship with a third-party, non-bank lender. When an additional $310 billion in funds were approved and designated for the PPP, we opted to set up an internal, automated loan process utilizing our core system provider.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB\u201d) implemented a liquidity facility available to financial institutions participating in the PPP. However, we opted to fund all PPP loans through our internal liquidity sources. These loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and do not represent a credit risk. The vast majority of these PPP loans have been forgiven.\nThe Bank provided loan payment deferrals to customers under Section 4013 of the CARES Act and regulatory interagency guidance regarding loan modifications.

If an extended recession caused large numbers of our deposit customers to withdraw their funds, we might become more reliant on volatile or more expensive sources of funding.\nThe Company is monitoring and will continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the potential risks and impact on our liquidity and capital resources.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nEarnings Summary\n2021 Highlights\n\u2022Net interest income increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $111.2 million for the full year 2021 compared to $105.1 million for the full year 2020 primarily due to the enhanced return on restructured loan assets and collection of significant late fees on those loan assets, as well as a decline in funding costs during 2021.\n\u2022The provision for credit losses totaled $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $18.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Total noninterest income increased $2.3 million to $28.9 million for the full year 2021 compared to $26.6 million for the full year 2020.\n\u2022Total noninterest expense decreased $56.5 million to $102.3 million for the full year 2021 compared to $158.8 million for the full year 2020.\n\u2022Provision for income taxes increased $3.3 million to $4.1 million for the full year 2021 compared to $0.8 million for the full year 2020.\nWe reported net income of $31.6 million, or $1.19 diluted earnings per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net loss of $45.9 million, or $1.74 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PERFORMANCE RATIOS </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>0.76 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.12) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Shareholders' Equity </td> <td> </td> <td>7.92 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.78) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.76 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Loans to Deposit Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>76.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>79.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>82.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for Credit Losses to Total Portfolio Loans </td> <td> </td> <td>3.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nOur principal source of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is affected by changes in the average balance of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads. The level and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities is managed by our Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d), in order to mitigate interest rate and liquidity risks of the balance sheet. A variety of ALCO strategies were implemented, within prescribed ALCO risk parameters, to produce what the Company believes is an acceptable level of net interest income.\nThe interest income on interest-earning assets and the net interest margin are presented on an FTE basis, which is a non-GAAP measure. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefit of income on certain tax-exempt loans and securities using the applicable\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7.

The Company believes this FTE presentation provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable sources of interest income.\nThe following table reconciles net interest income per the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) to net interest income on an FTE basis for the periods presented:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Interest Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>22,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,826 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,773 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income per Consolidated Statements of Net Income (Loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>111,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112,347 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to FTE Basis </td> <td> </td> <td>1,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income (FTE) (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>107,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,393 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Margin </td> <td> </td> <td>2.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.97 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to FTE Basis </td> <td> </td> <td>0.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Income (FTE) (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>2.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.05 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage Balance Sheet and Net Interest Income Analysis (FTE)\nTotal net interest income increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, to $111.2 million in 2021, as compared to $105.1 million in 2020. Net interest income, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased $5.2 million, or 4.8%, to $112.7 million in 2021 as compared to $107.5 million in 2020. The increase in net interest income, on an FTE basis, is driven by $13.1 million decrease in interest expense, offset by a $7.9 million decrease in interest income during 2021 as compared to 2020. The low interest rate environment and large commercial paydowns during 2021 has a negative impact on both net interest income and the net interest margin, but continues to be offset by a lower cost of funds as well as the positive impact of enhanced pricing on restructured loans and related late fees. Net interest margin increased six basis points to 2.80% in 2021 compared to 2.74% in 2020. The net interest margin, on an FTE basis (non-GAAP), increased four basis points to 2.84% in 2021 compared to 2.80% in 2020, primarily due to the aforementioned enhanced return on restructured loan assets and the collection of related fees during 2021. The intentional runoff of higher cost CDs continues to drive the decline in the overall cost of funds.\nCARTER BANKSHARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 7.
