Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe historical consolidated financial statements included herein represent the consolidated financial position, results of operations, other comprehensive income and cash flows of NSAM prior to the Mergers. As such, the consolidated financial statements included herein do not reflect the Colony NorthStar consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future or what Colony NorthStar's financial condition and results of operations would have been had NSAM been merged with Colony and NorthStar Realty during the historical periods presented. The consolidated financial statements included herein should be read and considered with the Colony and NorthStar Realty consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included as exhibits to this Form 10-K and pro forma financial statements and notes thereto that are filed with the SEC.\nNSAM commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the spin-off by NorthStar Realty of its asset management business into a separate publicly-traded company. Prior to the Mergers, NSAM was a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally including a substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital through various vehicles that include REITs and closed-end funds. Such Retail Companies raise capital through the retail market through NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the SEC. In addition, NSAM managed NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe.\nNSAM's primary business objective was to provide asset management and other services by managing the NorthStar Listed Companies and Retail Companies, both in the United States and internationally. In addition, NSAM entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to benefit from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures. NSAM earned asset management and other fees pursuant to management and other contracts and through its direct and indirect investments in strategic partnerships and joint ventures. The NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry.\nNSAM's historical business lines were as follows:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>NorthStar Listed Companies - Provided asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of the NorthStar Listed Companies.

In addition, such segment included opportunistic investments, such as the purchase of the NorthStar Listed Companies common stock.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe segments of NSAM's historical business described above do not represent segments of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers.\nNorthStar Listed Companies\nAs an asset manager, NSAM was responsible for the NorthStar Listed Companies' day-to-day activities, subject to supervision and management by each of the NorthStar Listed Companies' board of directors, as applicable. The management agreements with the NorthStar Listed Companies provided for a base management fee and incentive fee. The NorthStar Listed Companies are each responsible for all of their direct costs and expenses and reimburse NSAM for costs and expenses incurred by NSAM on their behalf. In addition, NSAM may allocate indirect costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the applicable NorthStar Listed Company's management agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM allocated $2 million of costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies. Such amounts are recorded net in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon completion of the Mergers, the management agreement with NorthStar Realty ceased to exist.\nRetail Companies\nThe following table presents a summary of the Retail Companies, including capital raise activity and investments as of or through February 23, 2017:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary Strategy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offering Amount (in millions)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offering Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capital Raised (in millions)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Investments (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed July 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,293.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,599.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare Equity and Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed January 2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,880.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,413.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed November 2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,739.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar/RXR New York Metro(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New York Metro Area CRE Equity and Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ends February 2018(4)(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9)\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Capital Fund\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt and Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>Ends July 2019(5)(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9)\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not Yet Effective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar/Townsend Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt and Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents amount of shares registered and raised to offer pursuant to each Retail Company's public offering, distribution reinvestment plan and follow-on public offering.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its initial public offering on February 2, 2015 by raising $1.1 billion in capital and its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016 by raising $0.7 billion in capital.

The operating cost reimbursement is calculated based on the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of each Retail Company's average invested assets; or (ii) 25.0% of each Retail Company's net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar\nnon-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. NSAM facilitates the payments of organization, offering and direct operating cost amounts, which are recorded in receivables on NSAM's consolidated balance sheets until repaid. The reimbursement of indirect operating cost amounts are recorded net in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM allocated $33 million of expense related to the Retail Companies.\nAn affiliate of Colony NorthStar is committed to invest up to $10 million in each of the Retail Companies during the respective two-year period following commencement of the offering. In addition, an affiliate of Colony NorthStar will commit up to $10 million for distribution support in the event that the Retail Companies' distributions to stockholders exceed certain measures of operating performance, in any Retail Company that Colony NorthStar may sponsor, up to a total of five new companies per year. The distribution support agreement related to NorthStar/RXR New York Metro is an obligation of both an affiliate of Colony NorthStar and RXR Realty, where each agreed to purchase 75% and 25% of any shares purchased, respectively. The distribution support agreement related to NorthStar Capital Fund is an obligation of an affiliate of Colony NorthStar.\nDirect Investments\nNSAM entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to augment NSAM's business operations, while at the same time benefiting from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments have included the acquisition of an 84% interest in Townsend, a 43% interest in American Healthcare Investors LLC, or AHI or AHI Interest, and a 45% interest in Island Hospitality Management Inc., or Island or Island Interest. In December 2016, in connection with the Mergers, NSAM sold the Island Interest for a note receivable of $29 million that matures in December 2026 at 8% and cash of $3 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Critical Accounting Policies presented represent those of NSAM's historical business and do not represent all of the Critical Accounting Policies of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers. We continue to evaluate the impact of Critical Accounting Policies for Colony NorthStar.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nNSAM's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NSAM, its operating partnership or NSAM OP and their consolidated subsidiaries. NSAM consolidates variable interest entities, or VIEs, where it is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by NSAM. All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. NSAM bases the qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.\nNSAM reassesses the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. NSAM determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for NSAM or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to NSAM's business activities and the other interests. NSAM reassesses the determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nNSAM evaluates the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which NSAM is the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE. NSAM analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If NSAM has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. NSAM does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nNSAM performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity's net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nNSAM may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option. NSAM may record the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow or may follow the practical expedient of the net asset value of the underlying fund investment based on the most recent available information, which is generally on a one quarter lag. NSAM will record the change from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).\nNSAM may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if it determines that it does not have significant influence. Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.\nNSAM reviews its investments in unconsolidated ventures for which it did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable. An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value. In conducting this review, NSAM considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nBusiness Combinations\nNSAM accounts for purchases of assets that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method where the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair value. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill. Such valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets including, but not limited to, customer relationships, acquired technology and trade names. Management's estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, NSAM may record adjustments to the assets acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred.\nIntangible Assets\nNSAM records acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as goodwill and other intangibles), based on estimated fair value. Other intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is expected to be realized.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. NSAM performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and evaluates the recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. NSAM first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets. The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEvents or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with non-compliance with regulatory requirements; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; a significant change in client mix; and/or a significant change in forecasts and assets under management.\nA discounted cash flow model is performed based on management's forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit to assess fair value. In addition, NSAM looks at comparable companies and representative transactions to validate management's expectations, where possible. The inputs used in the annual test is updated for current market conditions and forecasts. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the cash flow from operations from our reporting unit and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for the reporting unit's cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan. The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including EBITDA, EBITDA margins, revenue growth rate and capital spending requirements, among other items which impact the reporting unit projections. Cash flow beyond the specific operating plans are estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporate historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine the discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short-term or long term trend. Fair value of the reporting unit is using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments.\nThe annual impairment test for the reporting unit acquired in January 2016 was conducted as of December 31, 2016. Management used an independent third-party valuation party specialist to assist. NSAM's reporting unit calculated fair value was 7% in excess of its carrying value. Colony NorthStar continues to monitor the cash flow for this reporting unit.\nRevenue Recognition\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees include base and incentive fees earned from the NorthStar Listed Companies, acquisition, disposition and other fees earned from the Retail Companies and fees earned from clients and limited partners of Townsend. Asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned. Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents. Incentive fees that are subject to contingent repayment are not recognized as revenue until all related contingencies have been resolved.\nSelling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by NSAM for selling equity in the Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities. Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.\nThe present value of the expected future distribution fees earned from certain Retail Companies and incurred to participating broker-dealers is recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nNSAM follows fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for its financial instruments. NSAM categorizes its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The\nfair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on NSAM's consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1.\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2.\n</td> <td>Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3.\n</td> <td>Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair\n</td> </tr>\n</table> value measurement.\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as NSAM's knowledge and experience of the market.\nSecurities\nThe fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition. NSAM elected to apply the fair value option for its securities investments. Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend income is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nNSAM accounts for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award. Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof. For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method. For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.\nFor awards with a combination of performance or market measures, NSAM estimates the fair value as if it were two separate awards. First, NSAM estimates the probability of achieving the performance measure. If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, NSAM recognizes the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above. This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met. If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, NSAM records compensation expense based on the performance-based measure. NSAM would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.\nEquity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date. The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.\nIn connection with the Mergers, substantially all outstanding time-based equity awards issued to executives and non-executive employees vested in accordance with their terms. In addition, all or a portion of the outstanding NSAM performance-based awards issued to executives and non-executives vested in accordance with their terms, subject to forfeiture and reduction. As such, substantially all remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized immediately.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the spot currency exchange rate at the time of the transaction. The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency in the consolidated statements of operations.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nNSAM reported consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in a separate statement following the consolidated statements of operations. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI. The component of OCI includes an adjustment for foreign currency translation.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of NSAM's subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented. On March 13, 2015, NSAM restructured by forming the NSAM OP, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from NSAM for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit holders. The NSAM OP is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including NSAM. For the period prior to March 13, 2015, NSAM and its U.S. subsidiaries filed consolidated federal income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future tax consequences when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Such amounts arise from differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax laws and tax rates in the period which such changes are enacted. A provision for income tax represents the total of income taxes paid or payable for the current period, plus the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe below represent the evaluation by Colony NorthStar of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP. Key provisions include, but are not limited to, determining which goods or services are capable of being distinct in a contract to be accounted for separately as a performance obligation and recognizing variable consideration only to extent that it is probable a significant revenue reversal would not occur. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented (full retrospective) or retrospectively to contracts not completed as of date of initial application with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings (modified retrospective). In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year. The FASB has subsequently issued several amendments to the standard, including clarifying the guidance on assessing principal versus agent based on the notion of control, which affects recognition of revenue on a gross or net basis. These amendments have the same effective date and transition requirements as the new standard. Colony NorthStar plans to adopt the standard on its required effective date of January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. While Colony NorthStar continues to assess all potential impacts of the standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers, it currently believes that NSAM's historical management fees and selling commission and dealer manager fees will not be materially affected and continue to monitor accounting updates as it relates to NSAM's historical performance fees which will be subject to the revenue recognition provisions for variable consideration.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation. The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds. The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. NSAM adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined the NSAM OP is considered a VIE. NSAM is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE's assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE's obligations and NSAM's partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest. As such, this standard did not have a material impact on NSAM's historical consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. In the first quarter 2016, NSAM adopted this guidance and, as a result, the fair value of its interest in real estate private equity funds sponsored by Townsend of $21.0 million is not included in Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2016. NSAM did not have any investments measured using net asset value as of December 31, 2015.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addressed certain aspects of accounting and disclosure requirements of financial instruments, including the requirement that equity investments with readily determinable fair value be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in results of operations. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. NSAM does not have any equity investments with readily determinable fair value recorded as available-for-sale. Colony NorthStar does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The update requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase of the leased asset by the lessee. This classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The update is expected to result in the recognition of a right-to-use asset and related liability to account for NSAM's future obligations under its lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining contractual payments under lease agreements are discussed in Note 8. Additionally, the new update will require that lessees capitalize, as initial direct costs, only those costs that are incurred due to the execution of a lease. Under this guidance, allocated payroll costs and other costs that are incurred regardless of whether the lease is obtained will no longer be capitalized as initial direct costs and instead will be expensed as incurred. The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Colony NorthStar continues to assess the potential effect that the adoption of the updated guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting. The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting. The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Colony NorthStar will adopt the new guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017 and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, increasing the fair value of shares applied for income tax withholding without triggering liability accounting, allowing forfeitures related to service condition to be recognized upon occurrence, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Colony NorthStar will adopt the new guidance prospectively on January 1, 2017 and does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model for most financial instruments by requiring companies to recognize an allowance for expected losses, rather than incurred losses as required currently by the other-than-temporary impairment model. The guidance will apply to most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including trade and other receivables, loans, held-to-maturity debt securities, net investments in leases and off-balance-sheet credit exposures (e.g., loan commitments). The new guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and will be applied as a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. Colony NorthStar is currently assessing the potential effect the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued guidance that makes eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows which includes clarifying how the predominance principle should be applied when\ncash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows, as well as requiring an accounting policy election for classification of distributions received from equity method investees using either the cumulative earnings or nature of distributions approach. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The new guidance requires adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case the company would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Colony NorthStar does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. Entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and will be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. Colony NorthStar does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the definition of a business under ASC 805. This new standard clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this update will be applied on a prospective basis. Colony NorthStar does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued guidance which removes Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. The guidance is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Colony NorthStar anticipates early adoption of this guidance for the annual goodwill impairment test in 2017 for its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, as applicable, subsequent to the Mergers as it relates to NSAM's historical business.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\nThe

Other income in 2015 primarily represents special servicing fees related to certain securitization transactions at the corporate level. NSAM was a rated special servicer by Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings and NSAM received special servicing fees for services related to certain securitization transactions.\nExpenses\nCommission Expense\nCommission expense represents fees to participating broker-dealers with whom NorthStar Securities has selling agreements to raise capital for the Retail Companies and commissions to employees of NorthStar Securities. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, NSAM paid $2.7 million and $14.0 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 mostly due to: (i) lower capital raising activity as NorthStar Healthcare completed its follow-on offering in January 2016 and NorthStar Income II completed its offering in November 2016; and (ii) raising capital from the sale of Class T shares which has lower selling commissions and dealer manager fee than Class A shares.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense relates to a $500.0 million term loan, or Term Loan, that NSAM entered into in January 2016 in NSAM's corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nTransaction costs represent costs such as professional fees associated with new investments, merger related costs, dead deal costs and restructuring costs which are related to specific transactions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, transaction costs of $47.4 million primarily related to the Mergers of $37.7 million in NSAM's corporate segment and $7.2 million associated with the acquisition of NSAM's interest in Townsend in NSAM's direct investments segment. For the year ended December 31, 2015, transaction costs represent costs such as a one-time buyout in satisfaction of all participating interests related to NorthStar Income in NSAM's corporate segment and professional fees associated with the acquisition of NSAM's interest in Townsend in NSAM's direct investments segment.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased primarily due to $2.1 million of reimbursable expenses and $1.0 million of commission expense related to Townsend in NSAM's direct investments segment and $2.5 million of incremental base management fees to AHI and $1.0 million impairment of a convertible debt investment in NSAM's corporate segment. Other expenses in 2015 primarily related to the base management fees NSAM incurred to AHI in NSAM's corporate segment.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expenses and other costs incurred at NorthStar Securities, which is part of NSAM's broker-dealer segment and Townsend, which is part of NSAM's direct investments segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies of $34.8 million and $46.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $42.0 million primarily attributable to the following:\nThe following table presents compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015

decrease in allocation of costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies.\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nUnrealized gain (loss) on investments and other is primarily related to the non-cash change in fair value for the investment in the NorthStar Listed Companies common stock.\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments and Other\nRealized gain (loss) on

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, NSAM paid $14.0 million and $13.8 million, respectively, to NorthStar Securities employees. Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense increased due to higher capital raising activity for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense relates to the revolving credit agreement that NSAM entered into in November 2015, in NSAM's corporate segment.\nTransaction Costs\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, transaction costs represent a one-time buyout in satisfaction of all participating interests related to NorthStar Income in NSAM's corporate segment and professional fees associated with the acquisition of NSAM's interest in Townsend in NSAM's direct investments segment. For the year ended December 31, 2014, transaction costs represents costs such as professional fees associated with the NSAM Spin-off in NSAM's corporate segment.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses increased primarily due to the base management fees NSAM incurred to AHI for the year ended December 31, 2015 in NSAM's corporate segment. Such fees began in December 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses are principally incurred at the corporate level except as it relates to direct compensation expenses and other costs incurred at NorthStar Securities, which is part of NSAM's broker-dealer segment. In addition, the amount of general and administrative expenses reflects an offset from an allocation of costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies of $46.9 million and $37.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $52.6 million primarily attributable to the following:\nThe following table presents compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014

primarily due to the NSAM Spin-off as the 2014 amount represented an allocation of other general and administrative expense related to NorthStar Realty's historical asset management business for the

domestic and international income tax, as such, there was no income tax benefit (expense) for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase is primarily due to a one-time valuation allowance in 2014 and the distribution of earnings between tax jurisdictions in 2015 compared to 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nColony NorthStar's financing strategy is to employ investment-specific financing principally on a non-recourse basis with matching terms and currencies, as available and applicable, through first mortgages, senior loan participations or securitizations. In addition to investment-specific financings, we may use and have used credit facilities and repurchase facilities on a shorter term basis and public and private, secured and unsecured debt issuances on a longer term basis.

Distribution requirements imposed on us to qualify as a REIT generally will require that we distribute to our stockholders 90% of our taxable income, which may constrain our ability to accumulate operating cash flow. In connection with the Mergers, the Operating Partnership entered into a revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion with JP Morgan Chase as lender and administrative agent and several lenders.\nU.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income. We intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. The board of directors will determine an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including cash available for distribution, availability of existing cash balances, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impacted our business or prospects. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal income tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service, if any. If our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities.\nSources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flow\nColony NorthStar will primarily generate revenue from net operating income comprised of property related revenues less property operating expenses. In addition, we will generate interest income from commercial real estate related loans and securities and will generate equity in earnings from investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Our income from such segments will be partially offset by interest expense associated with borrowings against our investments. Finally, we expect to generate fee revenue from our investment management segment through the management of various types of investment products, including both institutional and retail capital. Our overall operating income generated from our investment portfolio and investment management segment will be partially offset by interest expense associated with corporate level borrowing and cash general and administrative and other expenses.\nCash Flows\nThe following presents a summary of NSAM's consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. NSAM historically generated revenue from asset management and other fee income pursuant to contractual arrangements with the NorthStar Listed Companies, the Retail Companies and through its interest in Townsend. NSAM also generated revenue from commission income from selling equity in the Retail Companies and recorded equity in earnings (losses) and received distributions from investments in unconsolidated ventures.

The activity in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily related to the timing of receipt of the NorthStar Realty management fee, more asset management fees from the Retail Companies and operating income from the acquisition of Townsend partially offset by the payment of transaction costs related to the Mergers and acquisition of Townsend and less acquisition fees from the Retail Companies.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $383 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Townsend in January 2016.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $262 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $121 million used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash flows provided from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was due to entering into the Term Loan, partially offset by the repayment of the credit facility of $100 million, $76 million for the payment of dividends, $18 million net cash payment on repurchase of shares related to equity-based awards and tax withholding and $5 million for the distributions to redeemable non-controlling interests. Cash flows used for financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to $105 million for the retirement of NSAM's shares, $78 million for the payment of dividends, $17 million for the call spread premium and $19 million for withholding tax related to vesting and net settlement of restricted stock units, or RSUs, partially offset by $100 million borrowed under the credit facility.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to December 31, 2014\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $47 million provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily due to fees beginning to be earned on July 1, 2014 from NorthStar Realty and an increase in asset management and other fees from the Retail Companies primarily due to more investment activity. Year ended December 31, 2015 excludes $54 million of fees received subsequent to December 31, 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $44 million used in investment activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase was due to the acquisition of the Island Interest and the purchase of shares of NorthStar Realty in 2015, compared to the acquisition of the AHI Interest and interest in Distributed Finance Corporation, or Distributed Finance, in 2014.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $121 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $99 million provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to $105 million for the retirement of NSAM's shares, $78 million for the payment of dividends, $17 million for the call spread premium and $19 million for withholding tax related to vesting and net settlement of restricted stock units, or RSUs, partially offset by $100 million borrowed under the credit facility. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to NSAM's initial capitalization from NorthStar Realty, partially offset by the payment of dividends.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents NSAM's contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016.

Refer to Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in NSAM's consolidated financial statements. NSAM's exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of its investment.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nThe following disclosures of related party arrangements are that of NSAM prior to the Mergers:\nNorthStar Realty\nInvestment Opportunities\nUnder the management agreement with NorthStar Realty prior to the Mergers, NorthStar Realty agreed to make available to NSAM for the benefit of the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies, including NorthStar Realty, all investment opportunities sourced by NorthStar Realty.

Pursuant to the management agreement, NorthStar Realty is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for its services in connection with any loan origination opportunities sourced by it, which may include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage interests, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests, in each case relating to commercial real estate.

The revolving credit facility was unsecured. The terms of the revolving credit facility contained various representations, warranties, covenants and conditions, including the condition that NorthStar Realty's obligation to advance proceeds to NSAM is dependent upon NorthStar Realty and its affiliates having at least $100 million of either unrestricted cash\nand cash equivalents or amounts available under committed lines of credit, after taking into account the amount NSAM seeks to draw under the facility. As of December 31, 2016, NSAM had no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement. In January 2017, NSAM borrowed $40 million under the credit agreement, which was eliminated in connection with the Mergers.\nLoan Agreements\nSeparately, in January 2017 and prior to the Mergers, affiliates of NSAM entered into loan agreements with affiliates of NorthStar Realty in the aggregate amount of $500.9 million with a maturity of January 10, 2027 at 8.0%. Such intercompany loans remain outstanding between subsidiaries of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers.\nNorthStar Listed Companies Shares\nNSAM purchased 2.7 million and 0.2 million shares of NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe, respectively, in the open market for $52 million in the aggregate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM recorded an unrealized loss of $4 million and recorded $4 million of related dividend income.\nRecent Sales or Commitments to Sell to the Retail Companies\nDuring 2016, NorthStar Realty entered into agreements to sell certain assets to the Retail Companies. The board of directors of each Retail Company, including all of the independent directors, approved of the respective transactions after considering, among other matters, third party pricing support.\nHealthcare Strategic Joint Venture\nIn January 2014, NSAM entered into a long-term strategic partnership with James F. Flaherty III, former Chief Executive Officer of HCP, Inc., focused on expanding its healthcare business into a preeminent healthcare platform, or the Healthcare Strategic Partnership. In connection with the partnership, Mr. Flaherty oversees both NorthStar Realty's healthcare real estate portfolio and the portfolio of NorthStar Healthcare. In connection with entering into the partnership, NorthStar Realty granted Mr. Flaherty certain RSUs, half of which became RSUs of NSAM as a result of the NSAM Spin-off. The Healthcare Strategic Partnership is entitled to incentive fees ranging from 20% to 25% above certain hurdles for new and existing healthcare real estate investments held by NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Healthcare. The Healthcare Strategic Partnership is also entitled to any incentive fees earned from NorthStar Healthcare or any future healthcare retail vehicles sponsored by NSAM, NorthStar Realty or any affiliates, as well as future healthcare retail vehicles sponsored by AHI Ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM did not earn incentive fees related to the Healthcare Strategic Partnership.\nOn February 2, 2015, in connection with the completion of NorthStar Healthcare's initial primary offering, NSAM issued 20,305 RSUs to Mr. Flaherty. On December 17, 2015, in connection with the completion of NorthStar Healthcare's follow-on public offering, NSAM issued 139,473 RSUs to Mr. Flaherty. On January 19, 2016, NSAM issued an additional 527 RSUs to Mr. Flaherty.\nAHI Venture\nIn connection with NSAM's 43% interest in AHI, or AHI Interest, AHI Newco, LLC, or AHI Ventures, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of AHI, provides certain asset management, property management and other services to affiliates of NSAM assisting in managing the current and future healthcare assets (excluding any joint venture assets) of NorthStar Realty and other Retail Companies, including the assets formerly owned by Griffin-American, and its former operating partnership, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT II Holdings, LP, or Griffin-America OP portfolio, and third party assets, representing $8 billion, of which $5 billion is owned by NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Healthcare. AHI Ventures receives a base management fee of $2 million per year plus an additional 0.50% on certain additional equity invested by NorthStar Realty or NorthStar Healthcare in future healthcare assets (excluding assets in the Griffin-American OP portfolio and other joint ventures) that AHI Ventures may manage. AHI Ventures may also participate in the incentive fees earned by NSAM and its affiliates with respect to new and existing healthcare real estate investments held by NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Healthcare, including the Griffin-American OP portfolio, any future healthcare retail vehicles sponsored by NSAM, NorthStar Realty or any affiliates, as well as any future healthcare retail vehicles sponsored by AHI Ventures. AHI Ventures would also be entitled to additional base management fees should it manage assets on behalf of any other NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies. AHI Ventures also intends to directly or indirectly sponsor, co-sponsor, form, register, market, advise, manage and/or operate investment vehicles that are intended to invest primarily in healthcare real estate assets. In addition, Mr. Flaherty acquired a 12% interest, as adjusted, in AHI Ventures. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM incurred $3 million of base management fees to AHI. Also, AHI provides certain asset management, property management and other services to NorthStar Realty to assist in managing its properties. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NorthStar Realty incurred $2 million of property management fees to AHI.\nIn April 2015, Griffin-American Healthcare REIT III, Inc., a vehicle managed by an affiliate of AHI, distributed shares of its common stock to the members of AHI Ventures, of which NSAM received 0.2 million shares in connection with the distribution.\nIsland Venture\nIsland provides certain asset management, property management and other services to NorthStar Realty to assist in managing its hotel properties. Island receives a base management fee of 2.5% to 3.0% of the current monthly revenue of the NorthStar Realty hotel properties it manages for NorthStar Realty. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NorthStar Realty incurred $18 million of base property management and other fees to Island. In December 2016, in connection with the Mergers, NSAM sold the Island Interest for a note receivable of $29 million that matures in January 2027 at 8% and cash of $3 million.\nRecent Developments\nColony NorthStar\nOn January 10, 2017, NSAM completed the tri-party merger with Colony and NorthStar Realty under which the companies combined in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management company. The Mergers create a global equity REIT with an embedded investment management platform with increase scale and capabilities with approximately $56 billion of assets under management.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM redomesticated to Maryland and elected to be treated as a REIT beginning in 2017 and Colony and NorthStar Realty, through a series of transactions, merged with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which was renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc. NSAM's common stockholders received one share of Colony NorthStar's common stock for each share of NSAM common stock they owned. NSAM's stockholders received approximately 32.85%, Colony stockholders received approximately 33.25% and NorthStar Realty stockholders received approximately 33.90% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, excluding the effect of certain equity-based awards issued in 2017 in connection with the Mergers.\nHealthcare Joint Venture\nIn January 2017, Colony NorthStar completed the sale of an 18.7% interest in its healthcare real estate portfolio for net proceeds of approximately $340 million. The healthcare real estate portfolio is currently comprised of the Company's ownership interest, excluding existing minority interest holders, in 191 senior housing properties, 114 medical office properties, 14 hospitals and 107 skilled nursing facilities (such properties collectively referred to as the Healthcare Properties\u201d). The transaction represents an implied valuation for the Healthcare Properties of approximately $5 billion.\nDividends\nOn December 22, 2016, NSAM declared a special dividend for its common stockholders of $228 million or approximately $1.16 per share contingent upon consummation of the Mergers. The common stock dividend was paid on January 27, 2017 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2017.\nCredit Facility\nIn connection with the Mergers, the Operating Partnership entered into a revolving credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of up to $1 billion with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and the several lenders that are parties thereto. This facility matures in January 2021 and includes two six-month extension options.", "summary": "The report includes a summary of NSAM's historical consolidated financial statements and business operations prior to the Mergers.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe historical consolidated financial statements included herein represent the consolidated financial position, results of operations, other comprehensive income and cash flows of NSAM prior to the Mergers. As such, the consolidated financial statements included herein do not reflect the Colony NorthStar consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future or what Colony NorthStar's financial condition and results of operations would have been had NSAM been merged with Colony and NorthStar Realty during the historical periods presented. The consolidated financial statements included herein should be read and considered with the Colony and NorthStar Realty consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included as exhibits to this Form 10-K and pro forma financial statements and notes thereto that are filed with the SEC.\nNSAM commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the spin-off by NorthStar Realty of its asset management business into a separate publicly-traded company. Prior to the Mergers, NSAM was a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally including a substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital through various vehicles that include REITs and closed-end funds. Such Retail Companies raise capital through the retail market through NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the SEC. In addition, NSAM managed NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe.\nNSAM's primary business objective was to provide asset management and other services by managing the NorthStar Listed Companies and Retail Companies, both in the United States and internationally. In addition, NSAM entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to benefit from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures. NSAM earned asset management and other fees pursuant to management and other contracts and through its direct and indirect investments in strategic partnerships and joint ventures. The NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry.\nNSAM's historical business lines were as follows:\n \u2022 NorthStar Listed Companies - Provided asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of the NorthStar Listed Companies. NSAM began earning fees from NorthStar Realty on July 1, 2014 and NorthStar Europe on November 1, 2015. \n \u2022 Retail Companies - Provided asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of the Retail Companies. \n \u2022 Broker-dealer - Raised capital in the retail market through NorthStar Securities and earned dealer manager fees for selling equity in the Retail Companies. \n \u2022 Direct Investments - Invested in strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third-parties, either consolidated or unconsolidated, with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets, where NSAM benefited from the fee stream and potential incentive fee. \n \u2022 Corporate/Other - Included corporate level general and administrative expenses, as well as special servicing on a fee basis in connection with certain securitization transactions. In addition, such segment included opportunistic investments, such as the purchase of the NorthStar Listed Companies common stock. \nThe segments of NSAM's historical business described above do not represent segments of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers.\nNorthStar Listed Companies\nAs an asset manager, NSAM was responsible for the NorthStar Listed Companies' day-to-day activities, subject to supervision and management by each of the NorthStar Listed Companies' board of directors, as applicable. The management agreements with the NorthStar Listed Companies provided for a base management fee and incentive fee. The NorthStar Listed Companies are each responsible for all of their direct costs and expenses and reimburse NSAM for costs and expenses incurred by NSAM on their behalf. In addition, NSAM may allocate indirect costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the applicable NorthStar Listed Company's management agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM allocated $2 million of costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies. Such amounts are recorded net in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon completion of the Mergers, the management agreement with NorthStar Realty ceased to exist.\nRetail Companies\nThe following table presents a summary of the Retail Companies, including capital raise activity and investments as of or through February 23, 2017:\n\n________________\n (1) Represents amount of shares registered and raised to offer pursuant to each Retail Company's public offering, distribution reinvestment plan and follow-on public offering. \n (2) NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its initial public offering on February 2, 2015 by raising $1.1 billion in capital and its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016 by raising $0.7 billion in capital. NorthStar Income II closed its initial public offering on November 9, 2016 and raised $1.1 billion in capital. \n (3) Any asset management and other fees incurred by NorthStar/RXR New York Metro will be shared equally between NSAM and RXR Realty, as co-sponsors. \n (4) NorthStar/RXR New York Metro's registration statement became effective in 2015 and began raising capital in 2016. Colony NorthStar expects the capital raise to accelerate in 2017. \n (5) Offering period subject to extension as determined by the board of directors or trustees of each Retail Company. \n (6) Offering is for two feeder funds in a master feeder structure. \n (7) NorthStar Capital Fund's registration statement was declared effective by the SEC in May 2016. Colony NorthStar expects NorthStar Capital Fund to begin raising capital from third parties in the first half 2017. \n (8) NorthStar/Townsend Investment submitted a registration statement on Form N-2 to the SEC in October 2016. Colony NorthStar expects NorthStar/Townsend Investment to begin raising capital in the first half 2017. \n (9) In connection with the distribution support agreement with each Retail Company, an affiliate of Colony NorthStar purchased shares of common stock in NorthStar/RXR New York Metro and NorthStar Capital Fund for $1.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, since inception through December 31, 2016.  In addition, NSAM is entitled to certain expense allocations for costs paid on behalf of the Retail Companies which include: (i) reimbursement for organization and offering costs such as professional fees and other costs associated with the formation and offering of the Retail Company not to exceed 1.0% to 1.5% of the proceeds expected to be raised from the offering and excluding shares being offered pursuant to distribution reinvestment plans; and (ii) reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs such as certain salaries, bonus, equity-based compensation and professional and other costs such as rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses associated with managing the operations of the Retail Company. The operating cost reimbursement is calculated based on the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of each Retail Company's average invested assets; or (ii) 25.0% of each Retail Company's net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar\nnon-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. NSAM facilitates the payments of organization, offering and direct operating cost amounts, which are recorded in receivables on NSAM's consolidated balance sheets until repaid. The reimbursement of indirect operating cost amounts are recorded net in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM allocated $33 million of expense related to the Retail Companies.\nAn affiliate of Colony NorthStar is committed to invest up to $10 million in each of the Retail Companies during the respective two-year period following commencement of the offering. In addition, an affiliate of Colony NorthStar will commit up to $10 million for distribution support in the event that the Retail Companies' distributions to stockholders exceed certain measures of operating performance, in any Retail Company that Colony NorthStar may sponsor, up to a total of five new companies per year. The distribution support agreement related to NorthStar/RXR New York Metro is an obligation of both an affiliate of Colony NorthStar and RXR Realty, where each agreed to purchase 75% and 25% of any shares purchased, respectively. The distribution support agreement related to NorthStar Capital Fund is an obligation of an affiliate of Colony NorthStar.\nDirect Investments\nNSAM entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to augment NSAM's business operations, while at the same time benefiting from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments have included the acquisition of an 84% interest in Townsend, a 43% interest in American Healthcare Investors LLC, or AHI or AHI Interest, and a 45% interest in Island Hospitality Management Inc., or Island or Island Interest. In December 2016, in connection with the Mergers, NSAM sold the Island Interest for a note receivable of $29 million that matures in December 2026 at 8% and cash of $3 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Critical Accounting Policies presented represent those of NSAM's historical business and do not represent all of the Critical Accounting Policies of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers. We continue to evaluate the impact of Critical Accounting Policies for Colony NorthStar.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nNSAM's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NSAM, its operating partnership or NSAM OP and their consolidated subsidiaries. NSAM consolidates variable interest entities, or VIEs, where it is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by NSAM. All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. NSAM bases the qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.\nNSAM reassesses the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. NSAM determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for NSAM or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to NSAM's business activities and the other interests. NSAM reassesses the determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nNSAM evaluates the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which NSAM is the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE. NSAM analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If NSAM has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. NSAM does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nNSAM performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity's net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nNSAM may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option. NSAM may record the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow or may follow the practical expedient of the net asset value of the underlying fund investment based on the most recent available information, which is generally on a one quarter lag. NSAM will record the change from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).\nNSAM may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if it determines that it does not have significant influence. Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.\nNSAM reviews its investments in unconsolidated ventures for which it did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable. An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value. In conducting this review, NSAM considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nBusiness Combinations\nNSAM accounts for purchases of assets that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method where the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair value. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill. Such valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets including, but not limited to, customer relationships, acquired technology and trade names. Management's estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, NSAM may record adjustments to the assets acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred.\nIntangible Assets\nNSAM records acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as goodwill and other intangibles), based on estimated fair value. Other intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is expected to be realized.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. NSAM performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and evaluates the recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. NSAM first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets. The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEvents or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with non-compliance with regulatory requirements; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; a significant change in client mix; and/or a significant change in forecasts and assets under management.\nA discounted cash flow model is performed based on management's forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit to assess fair value. In addition, NSAM looks at comparable companies and representative transactions to validate management's expectations, where possible. The inputs used in the annual test is updated for current market conditions and forecasts. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the cash flow from operations from our reporting unit and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for the reporting unit's cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan. The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including EBITDA, EBITDA margins, revenue growth rate and capital spending requirements, among other items which impact the reporting unit projections. Cash flow beyond the specific operating plans are estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporate historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine the discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short-term or long term trend. Fair value of the reporting unit is using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments.\nThe annual impairment test for the reporting unit acquired in January 2016 was conducted as of December 31, 2016. Management used an independent third-party valuation party specialist to assist. NSAM's reporting unit calculated fair value was 7% in excess of its carrying value. Colony NorthStar continues to monitor the cash flow for this reporting unit.\nRevenue Recognition\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees include base and incentive fees earned from the NorthStar Listed Companies, acquisition, disposition and other fees earned from the Retail Companies and fees earned from clients and limited partners of Townsend. Asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned. Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents. Incentive fees that are subject to contingent repayment are not recognized as revenue until all related contingencies have been resolved.\nSelling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by NSAM for selling equity in the Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities. Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.\nThe present value of the expected future distribution fees earned from certain Retail Companies and incurred to participating broker-dealers is recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nNSAM follows fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for its financial instruments. NSAM categorizes its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The\nfair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on NSAM's consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\n\n\n (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. \n (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. \n (c) Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n (d) Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n Level 3. Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair  value measurement.\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as NSAM's knowledge and experience of the market.\nSecurities\nThe fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition. NSAM elected to apply the fair value option for its securities investments. Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend income is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nNSAM accounts for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award. Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof. For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method. For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.\nFor awards with a combination of performance or market measures, NSAM estimates the fair value as if it were two separate awards. First, NSAM estimates the probability of achieving the performance measure. If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, NSAM recognizes the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above. This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met. If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, NSAM records compensation expense based on the performance-based measure. NSAM would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.\nEquity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date. The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.\nIn connection with the Mergers, substantially all outstanding time-based equity awards issued to executives and non-executive employees vested in accordance with their terms. In addition, all or a portion of the outstanding NSAM performance-based awards issued to executives and non-executives vested in accordance with their terms, subject to forfeiture and reduction. As such, substantially all remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized immediately.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the spot currency exchange rate at the time of the transaction. The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency in the consolidated statements of operations.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nNSAM reported consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in a separate statement following the consolidated statements of operations. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI. The component of OCI includes an adjustment for foreign currency translation.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of NSAM's subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented. On March 13, 2015, NSAM restructured by forming the NSAM OP, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from NSAM for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit holders. The NSAM OP is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including NSAM. For the period prior to March 13, 2015, NSAM and its U.S. subsidiaries filed consolidated federal income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe historical consolidated financial statements included herein represent the consolidated financial position, results of operations, other comprehensive income and cash flows of NSAM prior to the Mergers. As such, the consolidated financial statements included herein do not reflect the Colony NorthStar consolidated financial condition and results of operations in the future or what Colony NorthStar's financial condition and results of operations would have been had NSAM been merged with Colony and NorthStar Realty during the historical periods presented. The consolidated financial statements included herein should be read and considered with the Colony and NorthStar Realty consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included as exhibits to this Form 10-K and pro forma financial statements and notes thereto that are filed with the SEC.\nNSAM commenced operations on July 1, 2014 upon the spin-off by NorthStar Realty of its asset management business into a separate publicly-traded company. Prior to the Mergers, NSAM was a global asset management firm focused on strategically managing real estate and other investment platforms in the United States and internationally including a substantial business raising and managing capital in the retail marketplace accessing a variety of pools of capital through various vehicles that include REITs and closed-end funds. Such Retail Companies raise capital through the retail market through NorthStar Securities, a captive broker-dealer platform registered with the SEC. In addition, NSAM managed NorthStar Realty and NorthStar Europe.\nNSAM's primary business objective was to provide asset management and other services by managing the NorthStar Listed Companies and Retail Companies, both in the United States and internationally. In addition, NSAM entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to benefit from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures. NSAM earned asset management and other fees pursuant to management and other contracts and through its direct and indirect investments in strategic partnerships and joint ventures. The NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies have historically invested in the CRE industry.\nNSAM's historical business lines were as follows:\n \u2022 NorthStar Listed Companies - Provided asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of the NorthStar Listed Companies. NSAM began earning fees from NorthStar Realty on July 1, 2014 and NorthStar Europe on November 1, 2015. \n \u2022 Retail Companies - Provided asset management and other services on a fee basis by managing the day-to-day activities of the Retail Companies. \n \u2022 Broker-dealer - Raised capital in the retail market through NorthStar Securities and earned dealer manager fees for selling equity in the Retail Companies. \n \u2022 Direct Investments - Invested in strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third-parties, either consolidated or unconsolidated, with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets, where NSAM benefited from the fee stream and potential incentive fee. \n \u2022 Corporate/Other - Included corporate level general and administrative expenses, as well as special servicing on a fee basis in connection with certain securitization transactions. In addition, such segment included opportunistic investments, such as the purchase of the NorthStar Listed Companies common stock. \nThe segments of NSAM's historical business described above do not represent segments of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers.\nNorthStar Listed Companies\nAs an asset manager, NSAM was responsible for the NorthStar Listed Companies' day-to-day activities, subject to supervision and management by each of the NorthStar Listed Companies' board of directors, as applicable. The management agreements with the NorthStar Listed Companies provided for a base management fee and incentive fee. The NorthStar Listed Companies are each responsible for all of their direct costs and expenses and reimburse NSAM for costs and expenses incurred by NSAM on their behalf. In addition, NSAM may allocate indirect costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, the applicable NorthStar Listed Company's management agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM allocated $2 million of costs to the NorthStar Listed Companies. Such amounts are recorded net in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon completion of the Mergers, the management agreement with NorthStar Realty ceased to exist.\nRetail Companies\nThe following table presents a summary of the Retail Companies, including capital raise activity and investments as of or through February 23, 2017:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary Strategy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offering Amount (in millions)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Offering Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Capital Raised (in millions)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Investments (in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed July 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,293.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,599.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Healthcare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Healthcare Equity and Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed January 2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,880.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,413.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Income II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,650.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Completed November 2016(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,739.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar/RXR New York Metro(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>New York Metro Area CRE Equity and Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ends February 2018(4)(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9)\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar Capital Fund\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt and Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,200.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>Ends July 2019(5)(7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9)\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Not Yet Effective\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NorthStar/Townsend Investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CRE Debt and Equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/A\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n (1) Represents amount of shares registered and raised to offer pursuant to each Retail Company's public offering, distribution reinvestment plan and follow-on public offering. \n (2) NorthStar Healthcare successfully completed its initial public offering on February 2, 2015 by raising $1.1 billion in capital and its follow-on public offering on January 19, 2016 by raising $0.7 billion in capital.

Colony NorthStar expects NorthStar/Townsend Investment to begin raising capital in the first half 2017. \n (9) In connection with the distribution support agreement with each Retail Company, an affiliate of Colony NorthStar purchased shares of common stock in NorthStar/RXR New York Metro and NorthStar Capital Fund for $1.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, since inception through December 31, 2016.  In addition, NSAM is entitled to certain expense allocations for costs paid on behalf of the Retail Companies which include: (i) reimbursement for organization and offering costs such as professional fees and other costs associated with the formation and offering of the Retail Company not to exceed 1.0% to 1.5% of the proceeds expected to be raised from the offering and excluding shares being offered pursuant to distribution reinvestment plans; and (ii) reimbursement for direct and indirect operating costs such as certain salaries, bonus, equity-based compensation and professional and other costs such as rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses associated with managing the operations of the Retail Company. The operating cost reimbursement is calculated based on the four preceding fiscal quarters not to exceed the greater of: (i) 2.0% of each Retail Company's average invested assets; or (ii) 25.0% of each Retail Company's net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, loan losses or other similar\nnon-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period. NSAM facilitates the payments of organization, offering and direct operating cost amounts, which are recorded in receivables on NSAM's consolidated balance sheets until repaid. The reimbursement of indirect operating cost amounts are recorded net in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, NSAM allocated $33 million of expense related to the Retail Companies.\nAn affiliate of Colony NorthStar is committed to invest up to $10 million in each of the Retail Companies during the respective two-year period following commencement of the offering. In addition, an affiliate of Colony NorthStar will commit up to $10 million for distribution support in the event that the Retail Companies' distributions to stockholders exceed certain measures of operating performance, in any Retail Company that Colony NorthStar may sponsor, up to a total of five new companies per year. The distribution support agreement related to NorthStar/RXR New York Metro is an obligation of both an affiliate of Colony NorthStar and RXR Realty, where each agreed to purchase 75% and 25% of any shares purchased, respectively. The distribution support agreement related to NorthStar Capital Fund is an obligation of an affiliate of Colony NorthStar.\nDirect Investments\nNSAM entered into strategic partnerships and joint ventures with third parties with expertise in commercial real estate or other sectors and markets to augment NSAM's business operations, while at the same time benefiting from fee streams generated by such strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments have included the acquisition of an 84% interest in Townsend, a 43% interest in American Healthcare Investors LLC, or AHI or AHI Interest, and a 45% interest in Island Hospitality Management Inc., or Island or Island Interest. In December 2016, in connection with the Mergers, NSAM sold the Island Interest for a note receivable of $29 million that matures in December 2026 at 8% and cash of $3 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Critical Accounting Policies presented represent those of NSAM's historical business and do not represent all of the Critical Accounting Policies of Colony NorthStar subsequent to the Mergers. We continue to evaluate the impact of Critical Accounting Policies for Colony NorthStar.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nNSAM's consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NSAM, its operating partnership or NSAM OP and their consolidated subsidiaries. NSAM consolidates variable interest entities, or VIEs, where it is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by NSAM. All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. NSAM bases the qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.\nNSAM reassesses the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events.\nA VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE. NSAM determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for NSAM or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE's purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to NSAM's business activities and the other interests. NSAM reassesses the determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions.\nNSAM evaluates the NorthStar Listed Companies and the Retail Companies, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions to which NSAM is the special servicer to determine whether they are a VIE. NSAM analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If NSAM has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. NSAM does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.\nNSAM performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Ventures\nA non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method.\nUnder the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity's net income (loss). Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents. An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents.\nNSAM may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option. NSAM may record the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow or may follow the practical expedient of the net asset value of the underlying fund investment based on the most recent available information, which is generally on a one quarter lag. NSAM will record the change from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations. Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss).\nNSAM may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if it determines that it does not have significant influence. Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment.\nNSAM reviews its investments in unconsolidated ventures for which it did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable. An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value. In conducting this review, NSAM considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors. To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEstimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nBusiness Combinations\nNSAM accounts for purchases of assets that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method where the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired based on estimated fair value. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable assets is recorded as goodwill. Such valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets including, but not limited to, customer relationships, acquired technology and trade names. Management's estimate of fair value is based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, NSAM may record adjustments to the assets acquired, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings. Transaction costs related to acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred and excluded from the fair value of consideration transferred.\nIntangible Assets\nNSAM records acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as goodwill and other intangibles), based on estimated fair value. Other intangible assets are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, reflecting the manner in which the related benefit is expected to be realized.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. NSAM performs an annual impairment test for goodwill and evaluates the recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable. NSAM first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary. The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets. The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill. To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEvents or circumstances which could indicate a potential impairment include (but are not limited to) issues with non-compliance with regulatory requirements; on-going or projected negative operating income or cash flow; a significant change in client mix; and/or a significant change in forecasts and assets under management.\nA discounted cash flow model is performed based on management's forecast of operating performance for each reporting unit to assess fair value. In addition, NSAM looks at comparable companies and representative transactions to validate management's expectations, where possible. The inputs used in the annual test is updated for current market conditions and forecasts. The two main assumptions used in measuring goodwill impairment, include the cash flow from operations from our reporting unit and the weighted average cost of capital. The starting point for the reporting unit's cash flow from operations is the detailed annual plan. The detailed planning process takes into consideration many factors including EBITDA, EBITDA margins, revenue growth rate and capital spending requirements, among other items which impact the reporting unit projections. Cash flow beyond the specific operating plans are estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporate historical and forecasted financial cyclical trends for each reporting unit and considered long-term earnings growth rates. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine the discount rate. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit changes are a short-term or long term trend. Fair value of the reporting unit is using significant unobservable inputs or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. These inputs are based on internal management estimates, forecasts and judgments.\nThe annual impairment test for the reporting unit acquired in January 2016 was conducted as of December 31, 2016. Management used an independent third-party valuation party specialist to assist. NSAM's reporting unit calculated fair value was 7% in excess of its carrying value. Colony NorthStar continues to monitor the cash flow for this reporting unit.\nRevenue Recognition\nAsset Management and Other Fees\nAsset management and other fees include base and incentive fees earned from the NorthStar Listed Companies, acquisition, disposition and other fees earned from the Retail Companies and fees earned from clients and limited partners of Townsend. Asset management and other fees are recognized based on contractual terms specified in the underlying governing documents in the periods during which the related services are performed and the amounts have been contractually earned. Incentive fees and payments are recognized subject to the achievement of return hurdles in accordance with the respective terms set forth in the governing documents. Incentive fees that are subject to contingent repayment are not recognized as revenue until all related contingencies have been resolved.\nSelling Commission and Dealer Manager Fees and Commission Expense\nSelling commission and dealer manager fees represent income earned by NSAM for selling equity in the Retail Companies through NorthStar Securities. Selling commission, dealer manager fees and commission expense are accrued on a trade date basis.\nThe present value of the expected future distribution fees earned from certain Retail Companies and incurred to participating broker-dealers is recorded gross on the consolidated balance sheets and in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nNSAM follows fair value guidance in accordance with U.S. GAAP to account for its financial instruments. NSAM categorizes its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The\nfair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on NSAM's consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1.\n</td> <td>Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2.\n</td> <td>Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. \n (b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. \n (c) Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n (d) Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. \n Level 3. Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair  value measurement.\nFinancial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as NSAM's knowledge and experience of the market.\nSecurities\nThe fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect fair value for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition. NSAM elected to apply the fair value option for its securities investments. Any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations. Dividend income is recorded in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nNSAM accounts for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of the fair value of the award. Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof. For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method. For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate. NSAM recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.\nFor awards with a combination of performance or market measures, NSAM estimates the fair value as if it were two separate awards. First, NSAM estimates the probability of achieving the performance measure. If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, NSAM recognizes the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above. This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met. If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, NSAM records compensation expense based on the performance-based measure. NSAM would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.\nEquity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date. The awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.\nIn connection with the Mergers, substantially all outstanding time-based equity awards issued to executives and non-executive employees vested in accordance with their terms. In addition, all or a portion of the outstanding NSAM performance-based awards issued to executives and non-executives vested in accordance with their terms, subject to forfeiture and reduction. As such, substantially all remaining unrecognized compensation cost was recognized immediately.\nForeign Currency\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the spot currency exchange rate at the time of the transaction. The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency in the consolidated statements of operations.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nNSAM reported consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in a separate statement following the consolidated statements of operations. Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as a change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI. The component of OCI includes an adjustment for foreign currency translation.\nIncome Taxes\nCertain of NSAM's subsidiaries are subject to taxation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities for the periods presented. On March 13, 2015, NSAM restructured by forming the NSAM OP, under Delaware law, by converting an existing limited liability company disregarded as separate from NSAM for federal income tax purposes to a Delaware limited partnership and admitting as limited partners LTIP Unit holders. The NSAM OP is taxed as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and consequently, its items of income gain, loss, deduction and credit are passed through to, and included in, the taxable income of each of its partners including NSAM. For the period prior to March 13, 2015, NSAM and its U.S. subsidiaries filed consolidated federal income tax returns. Income taxes are accounted for by the asset/liability approach in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes, if any, represent the expected future"}
