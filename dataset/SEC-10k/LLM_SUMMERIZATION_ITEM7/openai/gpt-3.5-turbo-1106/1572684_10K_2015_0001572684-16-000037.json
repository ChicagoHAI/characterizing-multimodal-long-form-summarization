Individual markets continue to experience varying results, as local home inventories, affordability, and employment factors strongly influence local markets.\nHomebuilding and land development is a local business. As a result, we expect local market conditions will affect our community count, revenue growth and operating performance. Local market trends are the principal factors that impact our revenue growth and our revenue related expenses. For example, when these trends are favorable, we expect our revenues from homebuilding and land development, as well as the expenses that vary with revenue, to generally increase; conversely, when these trends are negative, we expect our revenue and the expenses that vary with revenue to generally decline, although in each case the impact may not be immediate or directly proportional. When trends are favorable, we would expect to increase our community count by opening additional communities and expanding existing communities; conversely, when these trends are negative, we would expect to reduce or maintain our community count or decrease the pace at which we open additional communities and expand existing communities.\nOur operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect our continued focus on a number of initiatives, including growing our homebuilding operations and revenues, by increasing community count and units sold, improving our gross margin percentage, and gaining higher leverage of our fixed expenses.\nDuring 2015, we achieved growth in revenues as a result of increasing the number of average active selling communities (\"ASC\") by 75.0% from 16 during 2014 to 28 during 2015. Since our IPO, our annual homebuilding deliveries have increased 257.7% from 196 homes delivered in 2013 to 432 homes delivered in 2014 to 701 homes delivered in 2015. Our homebuilding revenue increased by $97.2 million, or 62.5%, to $252.6 million during 2015 from $155.4 million during 2014 and by $82.9 million in 2013. Our average selling price (\"ASP\") of homes delivered remained relatively constant at approximately $360,000 during 2015 and 2014.\n__________________________________\n1University of Michigan's monthly Survey of Consumers. The monthly average in 2015 was 92.9 as compared to the monthly average in 2014 of 84.1.\nOur strategy for generating revenue in our land development segment is centered around maximizing the value of each asset through active management including, but not limited to, entitlement activities, maintenance, municipal fee reduction, and development costs and phasing. While land sales tend to be more opportunistic, we evaluate each land parcel by considering the benefits of selling a land parcel at a given time, including the reinvestment of the proceeds, versus building homes on the property through our homebuilding operations and discounting these future cash flows. Land prices fluctuate and depend on various factors, such as the demand levels for land of other homebuilders and the supply of land to meet such demand. We regularly evaluate our land holdings in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by market and demand dynamics.\nOur land development segment saw reduced activity as revenue decreased by $11.4 million to $21.1 million in 2015 from $32.5 million in 2014. This decline is indicative of the opportunities we identified in 2015, and may or may not be indicative of market opportunities in the future.\nWe generated other revenue of $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of other income was from our construction management services provided to property owners primarily under cost plus fee\u201d contracts in Hilton Head, South Carolina. We acquired this business as a result of the Citizens Acquisition. This business was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nOur consolidated net income was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our consolidated net loss was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $13.5 million in net income from the prior year was due mainly to an increase in home deliveries from 432 in 2014 to 701 in 2015 that drove homebuilding revenue growth from $155.4 million in 2014 to $252.6 million in 2015.\nAnother factor that contributed to the increase in net income was the 1.1% improvement in our consolidated gross margin percentage. Our gross margin increased from 17.4% in 2014 to 18.5% in 2015.\nAdditionally, our net income in 2015 was positively impacted by our ability to increase revenue while maintaining sales and marketing and general and administration expenses, which improved by 5.1%, to 16.4% of revenue in 2015 from 21.5% of revenue in 2014. The combination of increasing unit deliveries and revenue throughout the year and maintaining our operating expenses reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nWe continued to focus our efforts on allocating capital in order to enhance our return metrics. Each new opportunity is evaluated on its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return thresholds. Once underway, our focus is on effectively managing our existing communities, inventory and absorption pace in order to seek improved gross margins. Our approach is proactive and focused on identifying operational efficiencies across all of our operations, including our corporate office.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the value of our backlog was $108.8 million compared to $32.5 million as of December 31, 2014 representing growth of 234.7%, or $76.3 million. The growth in backlog is a direct result of our increased community count that yielded an 81.8% growth in net new orders in 2015. Our backlog consists of homes under contract that have not yet been delivered and closed.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $39.8 million of cash, and cash equivalents. We had total indebtedness of $157.5 million, consisting of $74.7 million of our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2017 and $82.8 million of acquisition, development and construction financing. At December 31, 2015, our total equity was $217.4 million and our debt to total capitalization was 42.0%.\nWe are focused on finding the proper balance between maintaining adequate land positions to provide for continued growth and prudently managing our balance sheet. In 2015, land investment opportunities that met our underwriting criteria were such that our total lots owned and controlled decreased by 490 lots. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled a total of 5,878 residential lots.\nWe owned or controlled 4,284 lots in our West operating segment and 1,594 lots in our Southeast operating segment. As of December 31, 2015, we had an 8.4 year supply of owned or controlled lots based on 2015 deliveries. As of December 31, 2015, our property portfolio consisted of assets located in cities in the states of California, Washington, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\nNet new orders increased 81.8% to 860 net new orders in 2015 from 473 net new orders in 2014. As a result of new community openings, the number of average active selling communities increased 75.0% from 16 in 2014 to 28 in 2015. In addition, absorption per community per month increased to 2.6 net new orders in 2015 from 2.5 net new orders in 2014.\nOur backlog value increased by $76.3 million, or 234.7%, to $108.8 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a combination of an increase of 158 homes in backlog at year end and a 22.4% increase in the average sales price of each home in backlog to $437,000 from $357,000.\nResults of

We wrote 860 net new orders in 2015 as compared to 473 net new orders in 2014. The increase in net new orders was primarily due to opening new communities in 2015. We increased our average number of active selling communities 75.0% from 16 in 2014 to 28 in 2015. This increase in average number of active selling communities played the most significant role in the growth of new orders accounting for 95.3% of the growth. Improvement in our absorption per community per month accounted for 4.7% of the increase. Absorption per community per month increased to 2.6 sales in 2015 from 2.5 sales in 2014.\nOur backlog value increased by $76.3 million, or 234.7%, to $108.8 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The growth in backlog value is related to the increase in net new orders resulting in an increase of 158 homes in backlog at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014, and an $80,000 increase in average sales price of homes in backlog to $437,000 from $357,000. The significant change in backlog was attributable to a greater number of homes from the higher cost markets in the West homebuilding reporting segment.

The increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in home deliveries during 2015. The increase in home deliveries in 2015 was attributable to several factors, including an increased number of average selling communities and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales absorption per community. These factors were favorably impacted during 2015, in part, by a continued housing recovery in the majority of our markets, which contributed to increased demand for homes by home-buyers and our ability to open new communities. The increase in total revenue was moderated by a decrease in land development revenue, as more fully described below.\nHomebuilding Revenue\nHomebuilding revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $97.2 million, or 62.5%, to $252.6 million from $155.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily the result of an increase in the number of homes delivered to 701 in 2015, as compared to 432 homes delivered in 2014. The increase in number of homes delivered was mainly caused by the higher number of average active selling communities in 2015 as compared to 2014. Of the 28 average active selling communities as of December 31, 2015, 10 were located in our Southeast homebuilding segment and 18 were located in our Western homebuilding segment. The average selling price of a delivered home remained relatively constant at approximately $360,000 during 2015 and 2014, primarily due to the regional mix of homes sold.\nWe delivered 432 homes in our West homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $444,000 and 269 homes in our Southeast homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $226,000. The $97.2 million increase in homebuilding revenue in 2015 over 2014, was primarily related to increased units delivered.\nLand Development Revenue\nWhile our emphasis is on growing our homebuilding operations, we continue to seek opportunistic land sales to third-party homebuilders. Land development revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $11.4 million, or 35.0%, to $21.1 million, from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily the result of a decrease in the price to $66,000 per lot during 2015, as compared to $93,000 per lot during 2014. Of the $11.4 million decrease in land development revenue, approximately $8.1 million was due to decrease in pricing and $5.0 million was due to a decrease in number of lots sold, partially offset by $1.6 million of previously deferred revenue, recognized in 2015 as a result of partially satisfying certain performance obligations related to a land sale. Various factors can affect the price of land including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which we have land holdings. The lots sold during 2015\nwere a mix of improved and unimproved parcels primarily in our Western land development segment within the Washington Puget Sound, Central Valley and Southern California areas, and our Southeast land development segment within North Carolina.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, relates to construction management services provided by the Company which began in April 2014 with the Citizens Acquisition in our Southeast operating segment. This business line was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nCost of Sales\nHomebuilding Cost of Sales\nCost of sales in our homebuilding segments for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $78.1 million, including the impairment on real estate, or 59.6%, to $207.7 million, as compared to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $80.7 million was due to the increase in the number of homes delivered during 2015 (701 homes sold in 2015, as compared to 432 homes sold in 2014), partially offset by $2.8 million due to the decrease in the average cost per home sold during 2015 ($296,000 per home in 2015, as compared to $300,000 per home in 2014). The decrease in the average cost per home in 2015 was primarily attributable to our focus on improving the purchasing and management of construction costs.\nWe regularly monitor our real estate owned and our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment. As a part of this process, we look at trends in the national economy, trends in the local economies in which we operate, and trends in each individual community in which we own real estate.\nIn 2015, one of our local markets, Kern County, California, experienced negative trends. We have a number of communities in Bakersfield, which is in Kern County. Kern County's unemployment rate has remained elevated at 10.2% in December 2015, while the national average unemployment rate was 5.0% and the California state unemployment rate was 5.8%. In addition, building permit activity in Kern County decreased 7.0% year-over-year. A major driver of the Bakersfield economy is the drilling and extraction of oil and natural gas. Since June 1, 2014, the price of crude oil has fallen from $105.37 a barrel to a closing price of $29.08 on February 1, 2016. Over this period a barrel of crude oil had fallen 72%. In addition, one of our communities in Bakersfield recently delivered a number of homes at gross margins much lower than what we consider normal and customary.\nThe impairment analysis procedures for real estate are a two-step process. In the first step we look at the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. As part of our annual and quarterly planning process we generate detailed financial projections for each of our communities. Our analysis includes, among other items, 3-year undiscounted projected cash flows. In the case of our River Run community in Bakersfield, our 3-year undiscounted cash flow projections indicated negative cash flows. As of December 31, 2015 the River Run community consisted of 15 completed homes of which three were sold and in backlog, eight were completed standing inventory (i.e. spec homes), and three were model homes. In addition to the homes, we owned 14 finished lots.\nAs a result of the negative undiscounted cash flow projections, we identified that an impairment existed. In order to determine the amount of the impairment, we discounted the projected cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. As a result of our impairment procedures, we recorded an impairment of $923,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015 on our real estate inventory at River Run, located in Bakersfield, California.\nLand Development Cost of Sales\nCost of sales in our land development reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $10.2 million, or 40.0%, to $15.3 million, as compared to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this decrease, $3.9 million related to the decrease in the number of lots sold and $6.2 million related to a decrease in the average cost per lot sold. Various factors can affect the cost of land sales including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which our land sales occur.\nGross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

adjusted homebuilding gross margin and adjusted land development gross margin are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. These metrics have been adjusted to add back capitalized interest, and impairment and abandonment charges. We use adjusted gross margin information as a supplemental measure when evaluating our operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe this information is meaningful, because it isolates the impact that leverage and non-cash impairment and abandonment charges have on gross margin. Management uses adjusted gross margin when comparing our results with competitors and versus our internal budgets since the components (e.g. construction costs, land costs, incentives, etc.) are controllable at the operational level. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes interest expense and impairment and abandonment charges, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance is limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate gross margin information in the same manner that we do.\nAccordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. The table above provides a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin numbers to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nConsolidated gross margin increased $18.2 million, or 54.5% to $51.5 million in 2015 from $33.3 million in 2014. In percentage terms, our gross margin increased 1.1% to 18.5% in 2015 from 17.4% in 2014.\nHomebuilding gross margin increased by $19.1 million, or 73.9%, to $44.9 million in 2015 from $25.8 million in 2014. In percentage terms, homebuilding gross margin increases 1.2% to 17.8% in 2015 from 16.6% in 2014..\nThe increase in homebuilding gross margin was favorably impacted by the growth in the number of units delivered, the Company's focus on improving gross margins in 2015 by driving efficiency in its purchasing and field operations, coupled with the increase in the number of average active selling communities. We were able to accomplish the improvement in our gross margin by focusing on cost management and gaining additional incremental revenue from pre-sales, reducing the number of spec sales, increasing lot premiums where appropriate and a more deliberate offerings of upgrades.\nAs an example, the company's largest master planned community, East Garrison, located in Monterey County, California, wrote 95 net new orders and delivered 94 homes in three product lines in 2015. The three product lines generated an average gross margin of 22.0%. The company is introducing two new product lines, an age-targeted product and a first-time buyer product to complement the existing three product offerings. The combined offering allows us to reach the first time buyer, the first and second time move up buyers, and the active-adult and retiree buyers in one master planned community.\nLand development gross margin decreased by $1.2 million to $5.8 million in 2015 from $7.0 million in 2014. While the gross margin dollars decreased in land development, the gross margin percentage increased 5.9% to 27.6% in 2015 from 21.7% in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to a lower cost basis of the lots sold during 2015 relative to the sale price as compared to 2014.\nThe majority of our gross margin associated with other revenue is a result of our construction management services in our Southeast operating segment, which we sold in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nSales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expense\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change *\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As a Percentage of\nTotal Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>26,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total sales and marketing and general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Percentages may not add due to rounding.\nSales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $5.2 million, or 37.8%, to $18.9 million, as compared to approximately $13.7 million for the comparable 2014 period. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a 62.3% increase in the number of homes delivered as we account for outside realtor commissions and closing related costs as a sales and marketing expense.\nIn addition, the 75.0% increase in the average number of selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014 contributed to the increase sales and marketing expense. The increase in the number of selling communities led to an increase in the headcount of onsite sales personnel, the number of model homes and associated expenses as well as our marketing efforts to introduce our new communities. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expense decreased by 0.4% to 6.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 7.2% for the prior year. The decrease was due to a higher revenue base in 2015 relative to the increase in sales and marketing costs.\nGeneral and administrative (\"G&A\") expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased approximately $0.5 million, or 1.9%, to $26.9 million, as compared to $27.4 million for the 2014 period. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expense decreased 4.7% to 9.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 14.3% during the prior year.\nThe decrease was mainly due to a higher revenue base in 2015 coupled with the decrease in G&A expense. We were able to achieve this decrease by reducing our stock-based compensation expense, converting temporary staff to full time employees and reducing the fees paid under the Transitional Services Agreement which was completed on July 31, 2015. These savings amounted to approximately $2.8 million.\nStock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.7 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.6 million that was recorded in 2014. The decrease was a result of the initial grants from the IPO that were fully amortized in July 2015.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our G&A expenses included approximately $119,000 and $615,000, respectively, of expenses for certain services under the Transition Services Agreement with PICO. These services included executive management, information technology, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, risk management, tax and treasury. The Transition Services Agreement was completed on July 31, 2015.\nApproximately $778,000 of transaction costs related to the Citizens Acquisition were included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2014; no such expenses were incurred during the comparable period in 2015. These were offset by the revision of our estimate of the probable amount of contingent consideration due to Citizens which reduced G&A by $377,000.\nWhile headcount increased to 187 employees as of December 31, 2015 from 173 employees as of December 31, 2014, a majority of this increase was at the operational level as a result of opening new communities and the need to grow operational staff to support these new communities.\nOther Income\nOther income increased by $85,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $206,000, as compared to $121,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to commissions on the sale of homes.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, UCP, Inc. reported a consolidated pre-tax book income of $5.9 million and reported minimum tax for the year of $69,000. While we have recorded a tax deferred asset we have also recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. The full valuation allowance resulted after the Company considered whether it is more likely than not that any deferred income tax asset will be realized. The Company considered many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative earnings experience, expectations of future transactions, the carry-forward periods available and availability of tax planning strategies. The deferred tax assets and valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $7.6 million and $8.6 million, respectively. For a description of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance see Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" on income taxes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Income/Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $5.8 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nConsolidated Financial Data\nTable 117:

Accordingly, backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net new home orders, backlog (units) and backlog (value) in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to having 16 average active selling communities during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 7 during the year ended December 31, 2013. Active selling communities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 21 as compared to 9 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Additionally, the increase in number of selling communities The increase in the average number of active selling communities was mainly caused by new communities added as a result of our Citizens Acquisition.\nOur cancellation rate in 2014 decreased to 8.0% compared to 12.8% in 2013. The reduction was due in part to the influence of broader national factors, such as unease over the partial federal government shutdown and concerns over interest rate volatility, which adversely affected regional consumer confidence in the prior year. The decrease in our average sales price of backlog at year 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly because in 2013 we were primarily building and selling new homes in communities with higher average home prices particularly in Santa Clara and San Benito counties in California, which generally have higher average home prices than our other selling communities, especially in the Southeast.\nOwned and Controlled Lots\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we owned or controlled, pursuant to purchase or option contracts, an aggregate of 6,368 and 5,380 lots, respectively, as represented in the tables below (excludes home inventory):\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lots Owned\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lots\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>4,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southeast\n</td> <td>1,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>5,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lots Controlled(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(881\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southeast\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Lots Owned and Controlled(1)\n</td> <td>6,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Lots controlled include lots subject to purchase or option contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSoutheast projects were added during 2014 as part of our Citizens Acquisition which added 113 owned and 445 controlled lots to our owned and controlled lot portfolio.

Of our 6,368 owned and controlled lots as of December 31, 2014, 1,382 lots were finished, 4,707 were approved with primary entitlements and 279 lots were unentitled.\nRevenue\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homebuilding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Homes delivered (units)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average selling price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Land development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lots sold (units)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average selling price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average cost of sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $98.5 million, or 106.2%, to $191.2 million, as compared to $92.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of increased home sales during the 2014 period, attributable to an increased number of active selling communities and favorable sales pace at certain of those communities. These factors were favorably impacted during 2014 in part by a housing recovery in our markets, which contributed to increased demand for homes by homebuyers in many of our markets. The increase in number of average selling communities was mainly the result of our Citizens Acquisition.\nHomebuilding Revenue\nHomebuilding revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $82.9 million, or 114.3%, to $155.4 million, from $72.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This was primarily the result of an increase in the number of homes sold to 432 during 2014, as compared to 196 homes during 2013. The increase of homes sold was mainly caused by higher number of average active selling communities during 2014 when compared to 2013 primarily resulted from our Citizens Acquisition. Of the 21 active selling communities as of end of December 31, 2014, 7 were located in the Southeast (average selling communities as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 consists of those developments where we have more than 15 homes remaining to deliver). The increase in revenue was due to an increase in number of homes sold was partially offset by a decrease in average selling price in 2014 to $360,000 from $370,000 during 2013. This decrease in average selling price was mainly caused by the change in regional mix of homes sold. We sold 309 homes in our West homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $415,000 and 123 homes in our Southeast homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $220,000. Of the increase in homebuilding revenue during 2014 from the prior year, $87.3 million was related to increased units delivered offset by a decrease of $4.4 million due to a decrease in average selling price.\nLand Development Revenue\nDespite our emphasis on growing our homebuilding operations, we continue to seek and benefit from opportunistic land sales to third-party homebuilders. Land development revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $12.3 million, or 60.8%, to $32.5 million, as compared to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This was primarily the result of an increase in the number of lots sold to 348 during 2014, as compared to 253 lots during 2013. Of the $12.3 million increase in land development revenue, approximately $7.6 million was due to an increase in number of lots sold and $4.7 million was due to increase in pricing. Various factors can affect the price of land including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which the land sales occur. The lots sold during the 2014 period were a mix of improved and\nunimproved parcels in the South San Francisco Bay, Puget Sound, and Central Valley areas. The lots sold during the 2013 period were a mix of improved and unimproved parcels in the South San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound areas.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 relates to construction management services provided by the Company which began in April 2014 with the Citizens Acquisition.\nCost of Sales\nHome Building Cost of Sales\nCost of sales-homebuilding for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $72.1 million, or 125.4%, to $129.6 million, as compared to $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Of this increase, $69.1 million was due to the increase in the number of homes sold during 2014 (432 homes sold in 2014, as compared to 196 homes in 2013), and the remaining $3.0 million was due to the increase in the average cost per home sold during 2014 ($300,000 per home in 2014, as compared to $293,000 per home in 2013). The increase in the average cost per home sold in 2014 was primarily attributable to the regional mix of the homes delivered rather than cost increases associated with projects.\nLand Development Cost of Sales\nCost of sales-land development for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $11.6 million, or 84.3%, to $25.5 million, as compared to $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Of this increase, $5.3 million related to the increased number of lots sold and $6.3 million due to an increase in average cost per lot sold. Various factors can affect the cost of land sales, including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which the land sales occur.\nGross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

GAAP financial measures. These metrics have been adjusted to add back capitalized interest, and impairment and abandonment charges. We use adjusted gross margin information as a supplemental measure when evaluating our operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe this information is meaningful, because it isolates the impact that leverage and non-cash impairment and abandonment charges have on gross margin. Management uses adjusted gross margin when comparing our results with competitors and versus our internal budgets since the components (e.g. construction costs, land costs, incentives, etc.) are controllable at the operational level. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes interest expense and impairment and abandonment charges, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance is limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate gross margin information in the same manner that we do.\nAccordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. The table above provides a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin numbers to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nOur homebuilding gross margin percentage decreased by 4.1% from 20.7% in 2013 to 16.6% in 2014. This was mainly caused by higher cost basis of homes sold in 2014, as compared to the homes sold in prior year, as well as an increase in buyer incentives and higher interest costs from increased borrowings. Our homebuilding adjusted gross margin percentage decreased by 3.9% during the year ended December 31, 2014 over the prior year comparable period. The decrease in the adjusted gross margin percentage was also caused by the same factors stated above for gross margin excluding interest cost, a cost not included in this measure.\nThe decrease of 9.9% in our land development gross margin and 11.0% of land development adjusted gross margin percentage for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013, was primarily attributable to higher cost basis in the lots we sold during the 2014 period due to change in geographical mix of lots sold.\nOur other revenue was the result of construction management services, which began in April 2014 with the Citizens Acquisition.\nSales and Marketing and General and Administrative Expense\nWe are a growing company and have increased our resources, with a related increase in expenses, to accommodate that growth; however, we do not expect that our future operating expenses will be directly related to revenue, as we believe we have the opportunity to achieve operational efficiencies in connection with any future revenue growth.\nOur operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As a Percentage of\nTotal Revenue\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,101\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>27,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total sales and marketing and general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $7.1 million, or 106.8%, to $13.7 million, as compared to approximately $6.6 million for the comparable 2013 period. The increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to a 120.4% increase in the number of homes delivered for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same period in 2013. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expense remained constant at approximately 7.2% during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013.\nGeneral & Administrative (\"G&A\") expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased approximately $8.0 million, or 41.5%, to $27.4 million, as compared to $19.4 million for the 2013 period. The increase in G&A expense for the 2014 period as compared to the same period prior year was largely the result of expenses associated with becoming a public company in July of 2013 and increased headcount which increased personnel and related costs. Total headcount increased to 173 employees as of December 31, 2014 from 90 employees as of December 31, 2013. Total number of employees as of the end of fiscal year 2014 included 58 employees associated with our Southeast operating segment which was added as part of Citizens Acquisition. Stock-based compensation expense of approximately $3.6 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $2.2 million for the comparable period in the prior year. Moreover, approximately $778,000 of transaction costs related to the Citizens Acquisition were included in the results for the year ended December 31, 2014; no such expenses were incurred during the comparable period in the prior year. These were offset by the revision of our estimate of the probable amount of contingent consideration due to Citizens which reduced G&A by $377,000. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expense decreased to 14.3% during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to 20.9% for the comparable prior year period. The decrease was mainly due to a higher revenue base in 2014 relative to the increase in G&A expense.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our G&A expenses included approximately $615,000 and $400,000, respectively, of expenses for certain services under the Transition Services Agreement with PICO. These services included executive management, information technology, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, risk management, tax and treasury.\nOther Income\nOther income decreased by $201,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $121,000, as compared to $322,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was primarily attributable to $150,000 of income relating to the settlement of a claim we had against a third party during 2013.\nNet Income/Loss\nAs a result of the foregoing factors, consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $7.7 million compared to a consolidated net loss of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nReporting Segments\nWe are a leading homebuilder and land developer with expertise in residential land acquisition, development, and entitlement, as well as home design, construction, and sales. We operate in the states of California, Washington, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. We have homebuilding and land development reportable segments in our West operating segment and our Southeast operating segment.\nThe Company continuously evaluates its homebuilding and land development operations to ensure that resources were appropriately allocated. Based on this evaluation, the Company has classified its operating activities into two geographical regions, West and Southeast. See Note 12 Segment Information\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following table presents financial information related to

accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in Note 2, the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies:\nSegment Reporting:\nThe Company has segmented its operating activities into two geographical regions. The Company currently has homebuilding and land development reportable segments in the West and Southeast. As such, all segment information is shown under the West and Southeast homebuilding and land development reportable segments.\nIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the Company considered similar economic and other characteristics, including geography, product types, average selling prices, gross margins, production processes, suppliers, subcontractors, regulatory environments, land acquisition results and underlying supply and demand in determining its reportable segments.\nCapitalization of Interest:\nThe Company capitalizes interest to real estate inventories during the period of development for land inventories and during construction for home inventories. Interest capitalized as a cost of real estate inventories is included in cost of sales-homebuilding or cost of sales-land development as related homes or real estate are delivered. To the extent the Company's debt exceeds the cost of the related asset under development, the Company expenses that portion of the interest incurred. Qualifying assets include projects that are actively under construction or under development.\nReal Estate Inventories and Cost of Sales:\nWe capitalize pre-acquisition costs, the purchase price of real estate, development costs and other allocated costs, including interest, during development and home construction. Applicable costs incurred after development or construction is substantially complete are charged to sales and marketing or general and administrative, as appropriate. Pre-acquisition costs, including non-refundable land deposits, are expensed to cost of sales when the Company determines continuation of the related project is not probable.\nLand, development and other common costs are typically allocated to real estate inventories using the relative-sales-value method. Direct home construction costs are recorded using the specific identification method. Cost of sales-homebuilding includes the allocation of construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, real estate development, capitalized interest, and related common costs based upon the relative-sales-value of the home. Changes to estimated total development costs subsequent to initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a relative-sales-value method to remaining homes in the community. Cost of sales-land development includes land acquisition and development costs, capitalized interest, impairment charges, abandonment charges for projects that are no longer economically viable, and real estate taxes.\nReal estate inventories are stated at cost, unless the carrying amount is determined not to be recoverable, in which case inventories are written down to fair value.\nAll real estate inventories are classified as held until the Company commits to a plan to sell the real estate, the real estate can be sold in its present condition or is being actively marketed for sale, and it is probable that the real estate will be sold within the next twelve months. Completed homes are included in real estate inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nImpairment of Real Estate Inventories:\nThe Company evaluates an impairment loss when conditions exist where the carrying amount of real estate is not fully recoverable and exceeds its fair value. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, significant decreases in local housing market values and selling prices of comparable homes, significant decreases in gross margins and sales absorption rates, costs in excess of budget, and actual or projected cash flow losses. The Company prepares and analyzes cash flows at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets.\nIf events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired, such impairment will be measured based upon the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of such assets determined using the estimated future discounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, generated from the use and ultimate disposition of the respective real estate inventories. Such losses, if any, are reported within cost of sales.\nWhen estimating undiscounted future cash flows of its real estate assets, the Company makes various assumptions, including: (i) expected sales prices and sales incentives to be offered, including the number of homes available on the market, pricing and incentives being offered by us or other builders in other communities, and future sales price adjustments based on market and economic trends; (ii) expected sales pace and cancellation rates based on local housing market conditions, competition and historical trends; (iii) costs incurred to date and expected to be incurred, including, but not limited to, land and land development costs, home construction costs, interest costs, indirect construction costs, and selling and marketing costs; (iv) alternative product offerings that may be offered that could have an impact on sales pace, sales price and/or building costs; and (v) alternative uses for the property. As of December 31, 2015, real estate assets in which the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were not in excess of their carrying values were written-down to their fair value resulting in an impairment charge of $923,000.\nPurchase Accounting and Business Combinations:\nAssets acquired and the liabilities assumed as part of a business combination are recognized separately from goodwill at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Estimates and assumptions are used to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable. Management may refine these estimates during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. As a result, during the measurement period, the Company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss.\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration, where applicable.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nThe purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between the net tangible assets and intangible assets of the acquired business with the residual purchase price recorded as goodwill. The determination of the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves certain judgments and estimates. These judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.\nAcquired intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives, ranging from six months to five years, or added to the value of the land when an option intangible is used to purchase the related land, or expensed in the period when the option is cancelled. Acquired intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective contractual lives. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed for the intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans.\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to: a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors; an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; change in customer, target market and strategy; unanticipated competition; loss of key personnel; or the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed.\nAn assessment of qualitative factors may be performed to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the result of the qualitative assessment is that it is more likely than not (i.e. > 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required.\nUnder the quantitative test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income or loss as \"Impairment of goodwill.\" Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties; using present value techniques of estimated future cash flows; or using valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.\nAs of December 31, 2015, acquired intangibles, including goodwill, relate to the Citizens Acquisition, which was completed on April 10, 2014. See Note 6 Business Combination\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of intangible assets.\nHomebuilding, Land Development Sales and Other Revenues Profit Recognition:\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 360 - Property, Plant, and Equipment, revenue from home sales and other real estate sales are recorded and any profit is recognized when the respective sales are closed. Sales are closed when all conditions of escrow are met, title passes to the buyer, appropriate consideration is received and collection of associated receivables, if any, is reasonably assured and the Company has no continuing involvement with the sold asset. The Company does not offer financing to any buyers. Sales price incentives are accounted for as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recorded. If the earnings process is not complete, the sale and any related profits are deferred for recognition in future periods. Any profit recorded is based on the calculation of cost of sales, which is dependent on an allocation of costs.\nIn addition to homebuilding and land development, with the completion of the Citizens Acquisition, the Company provided construction management services pursuant to which it builds homes on behalf of property owners. Revenue from providing these services is included in other revenues in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income or loss. The property owners fund all project costs incurred by the Company to build the homes. The Company primarily enters into cost plus fee\u201d contracts where it charges property owners for all direct and indirect costs plus a negotiated management fee. The management fee is typically a fixed fee, based on a percentage of the cost or home sales revenue of the project, depending on the terms of the agreement with the property owners. In accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, revenues from construction management services are recognized based upon a cost-to-cost approach in applying the percentage-of-completion method. Under this approach, revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred, divided by total costs expected to be incurred. The total estimated cost plus the management fee represents the total contract value. The Company recognizes revenue based on the actual costs incurred, plus the portion of the management fee it has earned to date. In the course of providing construction management services, the Company routinely subcontracts for services and incurs other direct costs on behalf of the property owners. These costs are included in the Company's cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income or loss. This business was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the period in which the awards vest in accordance with applicable guidance under ASC 718.\nWarranty Reserves:\nEstimated future direct warranty costs are accrued and charged to cost of sales-homebuilding in the period in which the related homebuilding revenue is recognized. Amounts accrued are based upon estimates of the amount the Company expects to pay for warranty work. The Company assesses the adequacy of its warranty reserves on a quarterly basis and adjust the amounts recorded, if necessary. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities:\nThe Company enters into purchase and option agreements for the purchase of real estate as part of the normal course of business. These purchase and option agreements enable the Company to acquire real estate at one or more future dates at pre-determined prices. The Company believes these acquisition structures reduce its financial risk associated with real estate acquisitions and holdings and allow the Company to better manage its cash position.\nBased on the relevant accounting guidance, the Company concluded that when it enters into a purchase agreement to acquire real estate from an entity, a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), may be created. The Company evaluates all option and purchase\nagreements for real estate to determine whether they are a VIE. The applicable accounting guidance requires that for each VIE, the Company assess whether it is the primary beneficiary and, if it is, the Company would consolidate the VIE in its consolidated financial statements in accordance with ASC Topic 810 - Consolidations, and reflect such assets and liabilities as Real estate inventories not owned.\u201d\nIn order to determine if the Company is the primary beneficiary, it must first assess whether it has the ability to control the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance. Such activities include, but are not limited to, the ability to determine the budget and scope of land development work, if any; the ability to control financing decisions for the VIE; the ability to acquire additional land into the VIE or dispose of land in the VIE not under contract with us; and the ability to change or amend the existing option contract with the VIE. If the Company is not determined to control such activities, the Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If the Company does have the ability to control such activities, the Company will continue its analysis by determining if it is also expected to absorb a potentially significant amount of the VIE's losses or, if no party absorbs the majority of such losses, if the Company will benefit from a potentially significant amount of the VIE's expected gains.\nIn substantially all cases, creditors of the entities with which the Company has option agreements have no recourse against the Company and the maximum exposure to loss on the applicable option or purchase agreements is limited to non-refundable option deposits and any capitalized pre-acquisition costs. Some of the Company's option or purchase deposits may be refundable to the Company if certain contractual conditions are not performed by the party selling the lots. The Company did not consolidate any land under option irrespective of whether a VIE was or was not present at December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014.\nPrice Participation Interests:\nFrom time to time, certain land purchase contracts and other agreements include provisions for additional payments to the sellers. These additional payments are contingent on certain future outcomes, such as, selling homes above a certain preset price or achieving an internal rate of return above a certain preset level. These additional payments, if triggered, are accounted for as cost of sales when they become due, however, they are neither fully determinable, nor due, until the transfer of title to the buyer is complete. Accordingly, no liability is recorded until the sale is complete.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company's provision for income tax expense includes federal and state income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting basis of the Company's assets and liabilities. The liability method of accounting for income taxes also requires the Company to reflect the effect of a tax rate change on accumulated deferred income taxes in income in the period in which the change is enacted.\nIn assessing the realization of deferred income taxes, the Company considered whether it is more likely than not that any deferred income tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income during the period in which temporary differences become deductible. If it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded. The Company considered many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, expectations of future transactions, the carry-forward periods available to the Company for tax reporting purposes and availability of tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about future events. These judgments are consistent with the plans and estimates the Company uses to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we considered three years of cumulative operating income or loss of the Company and its predecessor.\nIn making this assessment, management considered all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2015. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company's projections for future growth. As a result of the analysis of all available evidence as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. If the Company's assumptions change and the Company believes that it will be able to realize these deferred tax assets, the tax benefits relating to any reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets will be recognized as a reduction of future income tax expense. If the assumptions do not change, each period the Company could record an additional valuation allowance on any increases in the deferred tax assets.\nThe Company recognizes any uncertain income tax positions on income tax returns at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized unless it\nhas a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. The Company recognizes any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nNoncontrolling Interest:\nThe Company reports the share of its results of operations that are attributable to other owners of its consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly-owned, as noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income or loss, the income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest is reported separately, and the accumulated income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, along with any changes in ownership of the subsidiary, is reported as a component of total equity.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal uses of capital for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were funding our operating expenses, investing activities (principally acquiring and developing land, and building homes) and repaying liabilities and capital contributions to PICO. Our principal sources of liquidity were cash on hand, cash provided by operations, cash provided by financing activities (such as acquisition, development and construction financing and the issuance and sale of our Senior Notes ) and, through the date of our IPO, capital contributions from PICO. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $39.8 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect our principal uses of cash to be similar to what they have been in the past. We anticipate funding future capital requirements in a manner similar to our historical funding, except that we do not expect to receive any capital contributions from PICO in the future.\nIn accordance with the operating agreement between its partners, UCP LLC is required to distribute quarterly minimum tax payments with an annual total equal to 41% of all such taxable income by March 15 of the following year. Consequently, in March 2016, UCP LLC will distribute $3.9 million to PICO to meet this requirement. In addition, UCP LLC estimated it will distribute another $871,000 to PICO by April 15 and each quarter thereafter for estimated quarterly amounts due given its expectations of taxable income during 2016.\nWe believe that we have access to sufficient capital resources to fund our business for at least the next twelve months. We generally have the ability to defer future investment activity, such as acquiring and developing land or building additional homes for sale, until such time as we have adequate capital resources available to us. We also have the ability to sell land as an ordinary part of our business, which is influenced by supply and demand and factors in the markets where we own land assets.\nOur funding strategy contemplates the use of debt and equity financing and the reinvestment of cash from operations. We generally attempt to match the duration of our real estate assets with the duration of the capital that finances each real estate asset. We generally look to finance our homes under construction, which have a short duration, with a combination of long-term capital (equity and long-term bonds) and short-term bank financing. We generally look to finance our finished lots that will be put in production within one year, and therefore have a short duration, with a combination of long-term capital (equity and long-term bonds) and short-term bank financing. We generally look to finance our assets with a long duration, such as land held for future development or finished lots that will not be put into production for more than one year, with long-term capital (equity and long-term bonds).\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $245.4 million invested in our long duration assets of land held and land under development. For a description of our real estate inventories and outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2015, see Note 4, \"Real Estate Inventories,\" and Note 8, \"Debt,\" respectively, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe seek to manage our balance sheet in a manner that provides us with flexibility to access various types of financing, such as equity capital, secured debt and unsecured debt financing. For example, on October 21, 2014, we completed a private offering of $75\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2017. We intend to finance future acquisitions and developments with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of common and preferred equity, secured and unsecured corporate level debt, property-level debt and mortgage financing and other public, private or bank debt. For a description of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2015, see Note 8, \"Debt\" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSenior Notes\nOn October 21, 2014, we completed a private offering of $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.5% Senior Notes due 2017. The Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated as of October 21, 2014 (the Indenture\u201d), by and among us, the guarantors named therein and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee. The Senior Notes bear interest at 8.5% per annum, payable on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. The Senior Notes mature on October 21, 2017, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.\nThe Senior Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by each of our subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors\u201d). The Senior Notes and the guarantees are the Company's, and the Subsidiary Guarantors', senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the Subsidiary Guarantors' existing and future senior unsecured debt and senior in right of payment to all of our, and the Subsidiary Guarantors', future subordinated debt. The Senior Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to any of our and the Subsidiary Guarantors' existing and future secured debt, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt.\nWe may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus a make-whole\u201d premium, if applicable. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, we must offer to repurchase the Senior Notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. Under the Indenture, a change of control\u201d generally means (i) any person or group of related persons acquires more than 35% of our voting stock or (ii) we transfer all or substantially all of our consolidated assets to any person or group of related persons, in each case other than PICO and its affiliates.\nThe Indenture provides for customary events of default\u201d which could cause, or permit, the acceleration of the Senior Notes. Such events of default include: (i) a default in any payment of principal or interest on the Senior Notes; (ii) failure to comply with certain covenants contained in the Indenture; (iii) defaults under certain other indebtedness or the acceleration of certain other indebtedness prior to maturity; (iv) the failure to pay certain final judgments; and (vi) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency.\nThe Indenture limits our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional unsecured and secured indebtedness (provided that we may incur indebtedness so long as our ratio of indebtedness to consolidated tangible assets (on a pro forma basis) would be equal to or less than 45% and provided that the aggregate amount of secured debt may not exceed the greater of $75 million or 30% of our consolidated tangible assets); pay dividends and make certain investments and other restricted payments; acquire unimproved real property in excess of $75 million per fiscal year or in excess of $150 million over the term of the Senior Notes, except to the extent funded with subordinated obligations or the proceeds of equity issuances; create or incur certain liens; transfer or sell certain assets; and merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer or sell all or substantially all of our consolidated assets.\nAdditionally, the Indenture requires us to: (i) maintain at least $50 million of consolidated tangible assets not subject to liens securing indebtedness (the Minimum Unlevered Asset Pool Test\u201d); (ii) maintain a minimum net worth of at least $175 million (the Minimum Net Worth Test\u201d); (iii) maintain a minimum of $15 million of unrestricted cash and/or cash equivalents (the Minimum Liquidity Test\u201d); and (iv) not permit decreases in the amount of consolidated tangible assets by more than $25 million in any fiscal year or more than $50 million at any time after the issuance of the Senior Notes (the Consolidated Tangible Assets Test\u201d).\nThe foregoing is only a brief description of the Senior Notes and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Indenture.\nAs set forth below, as of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with each of the Minimum Unlevered Asset Pool Test, the Minimum Net Worth Test, the Consolidated Tangible Assets Test and the Minimum Liquidity Test.

In 2014, we used $130.5 million in net cash in our operating activities. In 2015, we generated $8.6 million of net income before non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, impairment and abandonment charges, depreciation and amortization, as well as, an adjustment to the fair value of our contingent consideration, as compared to net loss before non-cash expenses of $3.7 million in 2014.\nIn 2015, we used $38.5 million to finance an increase in our real estate inventories as compared to $131.0 million in 2014, a decrease of $92.6 million. The increase in inventories in 2015 was partially attributable to significant land purchases, including $24.8 million in our West operating segment and $3.8 million in our Southeast operating segment. In 2015, we used $2.4 million to finance growth in other assets and receivables as compared to $2.7 million in 2014.\nIn 2015, we used net cash for investing activities of $1.0 million related to purchasing fixed assets, representing a decrease of $14.3 million from cash used for investing activities in 2014 In 2014 we used net cash for investing activities of $15.3 million, $14.0 million of which is related to our acquisition of Citizens Homes, $1.0 million of which related to our purchase of fixed assets, and $0.3 million of restricted cash.\nWe generated $19.9 million of net cash by financing activities in 2015 as compared to $100.3 million in 2014. In 2015, proceeds from acquisition, development and construction loans totaled $134.5 million while repayments on theseloans totaled $112.4 million. In 2014, in support of the growth in real estate inventories and the acquisition of Citizens Homes, we generated net proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Notes of $74.6 million and proceeds from acquisition, development and construction loans of $78.3 million. In 2014, the repayments on these loans totaled $48.4 million. We incurred $0.8 million of debt issuance costs in 2015 as compared to 2014 when we incurred $1.9 million of debt issuance costs. Debt issuance costs in 2014 were higher as a result of issuing the senior notes.\nIn 2015, we paid a cash tax distribution to noncontrolling interest (i.e. PICO) of approximately $1.0 million; in 2014, we paid a cash tax distribution to noncontrolling interest (i.e. PICO) of $0.7 million.\nAs a result of our net cash from operating, investing and financing activities, we decreased our cash and cash equivalents by $2.2 million to a balance of $39.8 million as of December 31, 2015. In 2014 we decreased our cash balance by $45.5 million to $42.0 million.\nCash Flows - Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013\nOur comparison of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, is as follows:\nNet cash used in operating activities for 2014 was $130.5 million, an increase of $95.6 million from 2013. In 2014, we used $34.9 million in net cash in our operating activities. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $3.7 million before no-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, impairment and abandonment charges, depreciation and amortization, as well as an adjustment to the fair value of our contingent consideration, as compared to net loss before non-cash expenses of $1.5 million in 2013.\nIn 2014, we used $131.0 million to finance an increase in our real estate inventories as compared to $45.1 million in 2013, a decrease of $85.9 million. The increase in inventories was partially attributable to significant land purchases, including $76.9 million in our West operating segment and $32.2 million in our Southeast operating segment. In 2014, we used $2.7 million to finance growth in other assets and receivables as compared to $0.8 million million in 2013.\nIn 2014, we used net cash for investing activities of $15.3 million compared to $0.6 million in 2013. In 2014 we used $14.0 million of cash related to the acquisition of Citizens Homes and $1.0 million was used for the purchase of fixed assets. The net cash for investing activities in 2013 of $0.6 million is attributable to the purchase of fixed assets.\nWe generated $100.3 million of net cash tby financing activities in 2014 as compared to $112.7 million in 2013. In 2014, we received $74.6 million of net proceeds from the issuance of Senior Notes and proceeds from acquisition, development and construction loans of $78.3 million, for a total of $152.9 million. In 2014, the repayments of the acquisition, development and construction loans totaled $48.4 million. In 2013, we completed our IPO, issuing 7,750,000 shares of our Class A common stock for net proceeds of $105.5 million. In 2013, we generated $33.6 million of proceeds from acquisition, development and construction loans and repayments on these loans totaled $38.5 million. During 2013, prior to our IPO, PICO invested $37.5 million through cash contributions in support of our growth, and we distributed $25.4 million to PICO; the net contributions from PICO were $12.1 million in 2013 prior to the IPO. We incurred $1.9 million of debt issuance costs in 2014 related to our Senior Notes and our acquisition, development and construction loans compared to 2013 when we did not incur any debt issuance costs.\nIn 2014, after our IPO, we paid a cash tax distribution to noncontrolling interest (i.e. PICO) of $0.7 million.\nAs a result of our net cash from operating, investing and financing activities, we decreased our cash and cash equivalents by $45.5 million to a balance of $42.0 million as of December 31, 2014. In 2013 we increased our cash balance by $77.2 million to $87.5 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may enter into purchase or option contracts to procure lots for development and construction of homes or for sale to third-party homebuilders. We are subject to customary obligations associated with entering into contracts for the purchase of land. These contracts to purchase land typically require a cash deposit and are generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by the sellers, including obtaining applicable property and development entitlements.\nWe may also utilize purchase or option contracts with land sellers as a method of acquiring land in staged takedowns to help us manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings and to reduce the use of funds from our corporate financing sources. Purchase or option contracts generally require a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices. We generally have the right to terminate our obligations under both purchase or option contracts by forfeiting our cash deposit with no further financial responsibility to the land seller.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash deposits of $3.8 million outstanding pertaining to purchase contracts for 1,127 optioned lots with an aggregate remaining purchase price of approximately $80.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had outstanding $2.4 million of cash deposits pertaining to purchase contracts for 925 optioned lots with an aggregate remaining purchase price of approximately $49.6 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had approximately $232.6 million and $134.5 million, respectively, of existing loan commitments, of which approximately $75.1 million and $87.3 million, respectively, was available to us for future borrowing. For additional information, see Note 8, Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe are often required to provide municipalities and other government agencies performance bonds to secure the completion of our projects and/or in support of obligations to build community improvements, such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had outstanding surety bonds totaling approximately $37.1 million and $38.0 million, respectively. If any such performance bonds are called, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond. We do not believe that a material amount of any currently outstanding performance bonds will be called. Performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates. Rather, we are released from the performance bonds as the underlying performance is completed.\nInflation\nOur business can be adversely impacted by inflation, primarily from higher land, financing, labor, material and construction costs. In addition, inflation can lead to higher mortgage rates, which can significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to home buyers. While we attempt to pass on cost increases to customers through increased prices, when weak housing market conditions exist, we are often unable to offset cost increases with higher selling prices. Additionally, rising mortgage rates may result in a decrease in the number of homes we sell and a reduction in selling prices.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, the homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is also highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, the timing of new community openings and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to six months to construct a new home, we generally deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders convert to home deliveries. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur during the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations:\nThe following table provides a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commitments and contingencies as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on debt\n</td> <td>9,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,709\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe had no liabilities or potential interest for unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2015.", "summary": "The report discusses the company's financial performance, highlighting the increase in homebuilding revenue and net income, as well as improvements in consolidated gross margin and low cancellation rates.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may vary materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth in \"Risk Factors\" and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"In addition, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in connection with the information presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nSelect Operating Metrics\n\u2022Homebuilding revenue increased by $97.2 million, or 62.5%, to $252.6 million during 2015.\n \u2022 Consolidated net income of $5.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Consolidated net income of $7.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2015. \n \u2022 Consolidated gross margin percent grew 1.1% to 18.5% for the year ended 2015 and 4.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period during 2014. \n \u2022 Backlog increased 234.7% to $108.8 million. \n \u2022 Net new orders increased 81.8% to 860. \n \u2022 Sales & Marketing and General & Administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 5.1% to 16.4%. \n \u2022 Revenue in our Southeast homebuilding segment increased by $33.6 million, or 124.2%, to $60.7 million during 2015. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, the overall U.S. housing market continued to show signs of improvement, driven by factors such as continued supply and demand imbalance, low mortgage rates, improving employment growth and higher average consumer sentiment1 in 2015. Individual markets continue to experience varying results, as local home inventories, affordability, and employment factors strongly influence local markets.\nHomebuilding and land development is a local business. As a result, we expect local market conditions will affect our community count, revenue growth and operating performance. Local market trends are the principal factors that impact our revenue growth and our revenue related expenses. For example, when these trends are favorable, we expect our revenues from homebuilding and land development, as well as the expenses that vary with revenue, to generally increase; conversely, when these trends are negative, we expect our revenue and the expenses that vary with revenue to generally decline, although in each case the impact may not be immediate or directly proportional. When trends are favorable, we would expect to increase our community count by opening additional communities and expanding existing communities; conversely, when these trends are negative, we would expect to reduce or maintain our community count or decrease the pace at which we open additional communities and expand existing communities.\nOur operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect our continued focus on a number of initiatives, including growing our homebuilding operations and revenues, by increasing community count and units sold, improving our gross margin percentage, and gaining higher leverage of our fixed expenses.\nDuring 2015, we achieved growth in revenues as a result of increasing the number of average active selling communities (\"ASC\") by 75.0% from 16 during 2014 to 28 during 2015. Since our IPO, our annual homebuilding deliveries have increased 257.7% from 196 homes delivered in 2013 to 432 homes delivered in 2014 to 701 homes delivered in 2015. Our homebuilding revenue increased by $97.2 million, or 62.5%, to $252.6 million during 2015 from $155.4 million during 2014 and by $82.9 million in 2013. Our average selling price (\"ASP\") of homes delivered remained relatively constant at approximately $360,000 during 2015 and 2014.\n__________________________________\n1University of Michigan's monthly Survey of Consumers. The monthly average in 2015 was 92.9 as compared to the monthly average in 2014 of 84.1.\nOur strategy for generating revenue in our land development segment is centered around maximizing the value of each asset through active management including, but not limited to, entitlement activities, maintenance, municipal fee reduction, and development costs and phasing. While land sales tend to be more opportunistic, we evaluate each land parcel by considering the benefits of selling a land parcel at a given time, including the reinvestment of the proceeds, versus building homes on the property through our homebuilding operations and discounting these future cash flows. Land prices fluctuate and depend on various factors, such as the demand levels for land of other homebuilders and the supply of land to meet such demand. We regularly evaluate our land holdings in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by market and demand dynamics.\nOur land development segment saw reduced activity as revenue decreased by $11.4 million to $21.1 million in 2015 from $32.5 million in 2014. This decline is indicative of the opportunities we identified in 2015, and may or may not be indicative of market opportunities in the future.\nWe generated other revenue of $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of other income was from our construction management services provided to property owners primarily under cost plus fee\u201d contracts in Hilton Head, South Carolina. We acquired this business as a result of the Citizens Acquisition. This business was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nOur consolidated net income was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our consolidated net loss was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $13.5 million in net income from the prior year was due mainly to an increase in home deliveries from 432 in 2014 to 701 in 2015 that drove homebuilding revenue growth from $155.4 million in 2014 to $252.6 million in 2015.\nAnother factor that contributed to the increase in net income was the 1.1% improvement in our consolidated gross margin percentage. Our gross margin increased from 17.4% in 2014 to 18.5% in 2015.\nAdditionally, our net income in 2015 was positively impacted by our ability to increase revenue while maintaining sales and marketing and general and administration expenses, which improved by 5.1%, to 16.4% of revenue in 2015 from 21.5% of revenue in 2014. The combination of increasing unit deliveries and revenue throughout the year and maintaining our operating expenses reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nWe continued to focus our efforts on allocating capital in order to enhance our return metrics. Each new opportunity is evaluated on its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return thresholds. Once underway, our focus is on effectively managing our existing communities, inventory and absorption pace in order to seek improved gross margins. Our approach is proactive and focused on identifying operational efficiencies across all of our operations, including our corporate office.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the value of our backlog was $108.8 million compared to $32.5 million as of December 31, 2014 representing growth of 234.7%, or $76.3 million. The growth in backlog is a direct result of our increased community count that yielded an 81.8% growth in net new orders in 2015. Our backlog consists of homes under contract that have not yet been delivered and closed.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $39.8 million of cash, and cash equivalents. We had total indebtedness of $157.5 million, consisting of $74.7 million of our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2017 and $82.8 million of acquisition, development and construction financing. At December 31, 2015, our total equity was $217.4 million and our debt to total capitalization was 42.0%.\nWe are focused on finding the proper balance between maintaining adequate land positions to provide for continued growth and prudently managing our balance sheet. In 2015, land investment opportunities that met our underwriting criteria were such that our total lots owned and controlled decreased by 490 lots. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled a total of 5,878 residential lots.\nWe owned or controlled 4,284 lots in our West operating segment and 1,594 lots in our Southeast operating segment. As of December 31, 2015, we had an 8.4 year supply of owned or controlled lots based on 2015 deliveries. As of December 31, 2015, our property portfolio consisted of assets located in cities in the states of California, Washington, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\nNet new orders increased 81.8% to 860 net new orders in 2015 from 473 net new orders in 2014. As a result of new community openings, the number of average active selling communities increased 75.0% from 16 in 2014 to 28 in 2015. In addition, absorption per community per month increased to 2.6 net new orders in 2015 from 2.5 net new orders in 2014.\nOur backlog value increased by $76.3 million, or 234.7%, to $108.8 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a combination of an increase of 158 homes in backlog at year end and a 22.4% increase in the average sales price of each home in backlog to $437,000 from $357,000.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nConsolidated Financial Data\n\n* Percentages may not add up due to rounding.\nSelect Operating Metrics\n\n (1) Net new home orders\u201d refers to new home sales contracts reduced by the number of sales contracts canceled during the relevant period. \n (2) Cancellation rate\u201d refers to sales contracts canceled divided by sales contracts executed during the relevant period. \n (3) Average active selling communities during the period\u201d refers to the average number of open selling communities at the end of each month during the period. \n (4) \"Active selling communities\" consists of those developments where we have more than 15 homes remaining to deliver. \n (5) Backlog\u201d refers to homes under sales contracts that have not yet closed at the end of the relevant period. Sales contracts relating to homes in backlog may be canceled by the purchaser for a number of reasons, such as the prospective purchaser's inability to obtain suitable mortgage financing. Upon a cancellation, the escrow deposit is returned to the prospective purchaser (other than with respect to certain design-related deposits, which we retain). Accordingly, backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue. \nOur net new home orders increased 81.8% in 2015 over 2014. We wrote 860 net new orders in 2015 as compared to 473 net new orders in 2014. The increase in net new orders was primarily due to opening new communities in 2015. We increased our average number of active selling communities 75.0% from 16 in 2014 to 28 in 2015. This increase in average number of active selling communities played the most significant role in the growth of new orders accounting for 95.3% of the growth. Improvement in our absorption per community per month accounted for 4.7% of the increase. Absorption per community per month increased to 2.6 sales in 2015 from 2.5 sales in 2014.\nOur backlog value increased by $76.3 million, or 234.7%, to $108.8 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The growth in backlog value is related to the increase in net new orders resulting in an increase of 158 homes in backlog at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014, and an $80,000 increase in average sales price of homes in backlog to $437,000 from $357,000. The significant change in backlog was attributable to a greater number of homes from the higher cost markets in the West homebuilding reporting segment. Our cancellation rate increased in 2015 to 10.0% compared to 8.0% in 2014.\nOwned and Controlled Lots\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we owned or controlled, pursuant to purchase or option contracts, an aggregate of 5,878 and 6,368 lots, respectively, as represented in the tables below (excludes home inventory):\n\n (1) Controlled lots are those subject to a purchase or option contract. \nAs of December 31, 2015, our controlled lot inventory of 1,127 consisted of five new projects. For our controlled lots, we have placed a total of $3.8 million of cash deposits with an aggregate remaining purchase price (net of deposits) of approximately $80.1 million. Of our 5,878 owned and controlled lots as of December 31, 2015, 1,064 lots were finished, 3,973 were approved with primary entitlements and 841 lots were unentitled.\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $87.6 million, or 45.8%, to $278.8 million, as compared to $191.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in home deliveries during 2015. The increase in home deliveries in 2015 was attributable to several factors, including an increased number of average selling communities and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales absorption per community. These factors were favorably impacted during 2015, in part, by a continued housing recovery in the majority of our markets, which contributed to increased demand for homes by home-buyers and our ability to open new communities. The increase in total revenue was moderated by a decrease in land development revenue, as more fully described below.\nHomebuilding Revenue\nHomebuilding revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $97.2 million, or 62.5%, to $252.6 million from $155.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily the result of an increase in the number of homes delivered to 701 in 2015, as compared to 432 homes delivered in 2014. The increase in number of homes delivered was mainly caused by the higher number of average active selling communities in 2015 as compared to 2014. Of the 28 average active selling communities as of December 31, 2015, 10 were located in our Southeast homebuilding segment and 18 were located in our Western homebuilding segment. The average selling price of a delivered home remained relatively constant at approximately $360,000 during 2015 and 2014, primarily due to the regional mix of homes sold.\nWe delivered 432 homes in our West homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $444,000 and 269 homes in our Southeast homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $226,000. The $97.2 million increase in homebuilding revenue in 2015 over 2014, was primarily related to increased units delivered.\nLand Development Revenue\nWhile our emphasis is on growing our homebuilding operations, we continue to seek opportunistic land sales to third-party homebuilders. Land development revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $11.4 million, or 35.0%, to $21.1 million, from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily the result of a decrease in the price to $66,000 per lot during 2015, as compared to $93,000 per lot during 2014. Of the $11.4 million decrease in land development revenue, approximately $8.1 million was due to decrease in pricing and $5.0 million was due to a decrease in number of lots sold, partially offset by $1.6 million of previously deferred revenue, recognized in 2015 as a result of partially satisfying certain performance obligations related to a land sale. Various factors can affect the price of land including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which we have land holdings. The lots sold during 2015\nwere a mix of improved and unimproved parcels primarily in our Western land development segment within the Washington Puget Sound, Central Valley and Southern California areas, and our Southeast land development segment within North Carolina.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, relates to construction management services provided by the Company which began in April 2014 with the Citizens Acquisition in our Southeast operating segment. This business line was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nCost of Sales\nHomebuilding Cost of Sales\nCost of sales in our homebuilding segments for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $78.1 million, including the impairment on real estate, or 59.6%, to $207.7 million, as compared to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $80.7 million was due to the increase in the number of homes delivered during 2015 (701 homes sold in 2015, as compared to 432 homes sold in 2014), partially offset by $2.8 million due to the decrease in the average cost per home sold during 2015 ($296,000 per home in 2015, as compared to $300,000 per home in 2014). The decrease in the average cost per home in 2015 was primarily attributable to our focus on improving the purchasing and management of construction costs.\nWe regularly monitor our real estate owned and our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment. As a part of this process, we look at trends in the national economy, trends in the local economies in which we operate, and trends in each individual community in which we own real estate.\nIn 2015, one of our local markets, Kern County, California, experienced negative trends. We have a number of communities in Bakersfield, which is in Kern County. Kern County's unemployment rate has remained elevated at 10.2% in December 2015, while the national average unemployment rate was 5.0% and the California state unemployment rate was 5.8%. In addition, building permit activity in Kern County decreased 7.0% year-over-year. A major driver of the Bakersfield economy is the drilling and extraction of oil and natural gas. Since June 1, 2014, the price of crude oil has fallen from $105.37 a barrel to a closing price of $29.08 on February 1, 2016. Over this period a barrel of crude oil had fallen 72%. In addition, one of our communities in Bakersfield recently delivered a number of homes at gross margins much lower than what we consider normal and customary.\nThe impairment analysis procedures for real estate are a two-step process. In the first step we look at the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. As part of our annual and quarterly planning process we generate detailed financial projections for each of our communities. Our analysis includes, among other items, 3-year undiscounted projected cash flows. In the case of our River Run community in Bakersfield, our 3-year undiscounted cash flow projections indicated negative cash flows. As of December 31, 2015 the River Run community consisted of 15 completed homes of which three were sold and in backlog, eight were completed standing inventory (i.e. spec homes), and three were model homes. In addition to the homes, we owned 14 finished lots.\nAs a result of the negative undiscounted cash flow projections, we identified that an impairment existed. In order to determine the amount of the impairment, we discounted the projected cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. As a result of our impairment procedures, we recorded an impairment of $923,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015 on our real estate inventory at River Run, located in Bakersfield, California.\nLand Development Cost of Sales\nCost of sales in our land development reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $10.2 million, or 40.0%, to $15.3 million, as compared to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this decrease, $3.9 million related to the decrease in the number of lots sold and $6.2 million related to a decrease in the average cost per lot sold. Various factors can affect the cost of land sales including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which our land sales occur.\nGross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin\n\n* Percentages may not add due to rounding.\n (1) Adjusted gross margin, adjusted homebuilding gross margin and adjusted land development gross margin are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. These metrics have been adjusted to add back capitalized interest, and impairment and abandonment charges. We use adjusted gross margin information as a supplemental measure when evaluating our operating performance. \nWe believe this information is meaningful, because it isolates the impact that leverage and non-cash impairment and abandonment charges have on gross margin. Management uses adjusted gross margin when comparing our results with competitors and versus our internal budgets since the components (e.g. construction costs, land costs, incentives, etc.) are controllable at the operational level. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes interest expense and impairment and abandonment charges, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance is limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate gross margin information in the same manner that we do.\nAccordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. The table above provides a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin numbers to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nConsolidated gross margin increased $18.2 million, or 54.5% to $51.5 million in 2015 from $33.3 million in 2014. In percentage terms, our gross margin increased 1.1% to 18.5% in 2015 from 17.4% in 2014.\nHomebuilding", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

While land sales tend to be more opportunistic, we evaluate each land parcel by considering the benefits of selling a land parcel at a given time, including the reinvestment of the proceeds, versus building homes on the property through our homebuilding operations and discounting these future cash flows. Land prices fluctuate and depend on various factors, such as the demand levels for land of other homebuilders and the supply of land to meet such demand. We regularly evaluate our land holdings in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by market and demand dynamics.\nOur land development segment saw reduced activity as revenue decreased by $11.4 million to $21.1 million in 2015 from $32.5 million in 2014. This decline is indicative of the opportunities we identified in 2015, and may or may not be indicative of market opportunities in the future.\nWe generated other revenue of $5.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of other income was from our construction management services provided to property owners primarily under cost plus fee\u201d contracts in Hilton Head, South Carolina. We acquired this business as a result of the Citizens Acquisition. This business was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nOur consolidated net income was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our consolidated net loss was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase of $13.5 million in net income from the prior year was due mainly to an increase in home deliveries from 432 in 2014 to 701 in 2015 that drove homebuilding revenue growth from $155.4 million in 2014 to $252.6 million in 2015.\nAnother factor that contributed to the increase in net income was the 1.1% improvement in our consolidated gross margin percentage. Our gross margin increased from 17.4% in 2014 to 18.5% in 2015.\nAdditionally, our net income in 2015 was positively impacted by our ability to increase revenue while maintaining sales and marketing and general and administration expenses, which improved by 5.1%, to 16.4% of revenue in 2015 from 21.5% of revenue in 2014. The combination of increasing unit deliveries and revenue throughout the year and maintaining our operating expenses reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.\nWe continued to focus our efforts on allocating capital in order to enhance our return metrics. Each new opportunity is evaluated on its ability to meet our risk-adjusted return thresholds. Once underway, our focus is on effectively managing our existing communities, inventory and absorption pace in order to seek improved gross margins. Our approach is proactive and focused on identifying operational efficiencies across all of our operations, including our corporate office.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the value of our backlog was $108.8 million compared to $32.5 million as of December 31, 2014 representing growth of 234.7%, or $76.3 million. The growth in backlog is a direct result of our increased community count that yielded an 81.8% growth in net new orders in 2015. Our backlog consists of homes under contract that have not yet been delivered and closed.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $39.8 million of cash, and cash equivalents. We had total indebtedness of $157.5 million, consisting of $74.7 million of our 8.5% Senior Notes due 2017 and $82.8 million of acquisition, development and construction financing. At December 31, 2015, our total equity was $217.4 million and our debt to total capitalization was 42.0%.\nWe are focused on finding the proper balance between maintaining adequate land positions to provide for continued growth and prudently managing our balance sheet. In 2015, land investment opportunities that met our underwriting criteria were such that our total lots owned and controlled decreased by 490 lots. As of December 31, 2015, we owned or controlled a total of 5,878 residential lots.\nWe owned or controlled 4,284 lots in our West operating segment and 1,594 lots in our Southeast operating segment. As of December 31, 2015, we had an 8.4 year supply of owned or controlled lots based on 2015 deliveries. As of December 31, 2015, our property portfolio consisted of assets located in cities in the states of California, Washington, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.\nNet new orders increased 81.8% to 860 net new orders in 2015 from 473 net new orders in 2014. As a result of new community openings, the number of average active selling communities increased 75.0% from 16 in 2014 to 28 in 2015. In addition, absorption per community per month increased to 2.6 net new orders in 2015 from 2.5 net new orders in 2014.\nOur backlog value increased by $76.3 million, or 234.7%, to $108.8 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The increase was due to a combination of an increase of 158 homes in backlog at year end and a 22.4% increase in the average sales price of each home in backlog to $437,000 from $357,000.\nResults of

Sales contracts relating to homes in backlog may be canceled by the purchaser for a number of reasons, such as the prospective purchaser's inability to obtain suitable mortgage financing. Upon a cancellation, the escrow deposit is returned to the prospective purchaser (other than with respect to certain design-related deposits, which we retain). Accordingly, backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue. \nOur net new home orders increased 81.8% in 2015 over 2014. We wrote 860 net new orders in 2015 as compared to 473 net new orders in 2014. The increase in net new orders was primarily due to opening new communities in 2015. We increased our average number of active selling communities 75.0% from 16 in 2014 to 28 in 2015. This increase in average number of active selling communities played the most significant role in the growth of new orders accounting for 95.3% of the growth. Improvement in our absorption per community per month accounted for 4.7% of the increase. Absorption per community per month increased to 2.6 sales in 2015 from 2.5 sales in 2014.\nOur backlog value increased by $76.3 million, or 234.7%, to $108.8 million at December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The growth in backlog value is related to the increase in net new orders resulting in an increase of 158 homes in backlog at year-end 2015 compared to year-end 2014, and an $80,000 increase in average sales price of homes in backlog to $437,000 from $357,000. The significant change in backlog was attributable to a greater number of homes from the higher cost markets in the West homebuilding reporting segment. Our cancellation rate increased in 2015 to 10.0% compared to 8.0% in 2014.\nOwned and Controlled Lots\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we owned or controlled, pursuant to purchase or option contracts, an aggregate of 5,878 and 6,368 lots, respectively, as represented in the tables below (excludes home inventory):\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Lots\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lots Owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>3,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southeast\n</td> <td>882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(151\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>4,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(692\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lots Controlled(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>West\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(54\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Southeast\n</td> <td>712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>925\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Lots Owned and Controlled(1)\n</td> <td>5,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(490\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Controlled lots are those subject to a purchase or option contract. \nAs of December 31, 2015, our controlled lot inventory of 1,127 consisted of five new projects.

The increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in home deliveries during 2015. The increase in home deliveries in 2015 was attributable to several factors, including an increased number of average selling communities and, to a lesser extent, an increase in sales absorption per community. These factors were favorably impacted during 2015, in part, by a continued housing recovery in the majority of our markets, which contributed to increased demand for homes by home-buyers and our ability to open new communities. The increase in total revenue was moderated by a decrease in land development revenue, as more fully described below.\nHomebuilding Revenue\nHomebuilding revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $97.2 million, or 62.5%, to $252.6 million from $155.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily the result of an increase in the number of homes delivered to 701 in 2015, as compared to 432 homes delivered in 2014. The increase in number of homes delivered was mainly caused by the higher number of average active selling communities in 2015 as compared to 2014. Of the 28 average active selling communities as of December 31, 2015, 10 were located in our Southeast homebuilding segment and 18 were located in our Western homebuilding segment. The average selling price of a delivered home remained relatively constant at approximately $360,000 during 2015 and 2014, primarily due to the regional mix of homes sold.\nWe delivered 432 homes in our West homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $444,000 and 269 homes in our Southeast homebuilding segment with an average selling price of approximately $226,000. The $97.2 million increase in homebuilding revenue in 2015 over 2014, was primarily related to increased units delivered.\nLand Development Revenue\nWhile our emphasis is on growing our homebuilding operations, we continue to seek opportunistic land sales to third-party homebuilders. Land development revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $11.4 million, or 35.0%, to $21.1 million, from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This was primarily the result of a decrease in the price to $66,000 per lot during 2015, as compared to $93,000 per lot during 2014. Of the $11.4 million decrease in land development revenue, approximately $8.1 million was due to decrease in pricing and $5.0 million was due to a decrease in number of lots sold, partially offset by $1.6 million of previously deferred revenue, recognized in 2015 as a result of partially satisfying certain performance obligations related to a land sale. Various factors can affect the price of land including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which we have land holdings. The lots sold during 2015\nwere a mix of improved and unimproved parcels primarily in our Western land development segment within the Washington Puget Sound, Central Valley and Southern California areas, and our Southeast land development segment within North Carolina.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue of $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, relates to construction management services provided by the Company which began in April 2014 with the Citizens Acquisition in our Southeast operating segment. This business line was subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and therefore, we do not expect to generate revenues from construction management services in the future.\nCost of Sales\nHomebuilding Cost of Sales\nCost of sales in our homebuilding segments for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $78.1 million, including the impairment on real estate, or 59.6%, to $207.7 million, as compared to $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $80.7 million was due to the increase in the number of homes delivered during 2015 (701 homes sold in 2015, as compared to 432 homes sold in 2014), partially offset by $2.8 million due to the decrease in the average cost per home sold during 2015 ($296,000 per home in 2015, as compared to $300,000 per home in 2014). The decrease in the average cost per home in 2015 was primarily attributable to our focus on improving the purchasing and management of construction costs.\nWe regularly monitor our real estate owned and our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment. As a part of this process, we look at trends in the national economy, trends in the local economies in which we operate, and trends in each individual community in which we own real estate.\nIn 2015, one of our local markets, Kern County, California, experienced negative trends. We have a number of communities in Bakersfield, which is in Kern County. Kern County's unemployment rate has remained elevated at 10.2% in December 2015, while the national average unemployment rate was 5.0% and the California state unemployment rate was 5.8%. In addition, building permit activity in Kern County decreased 7.0% year-over-year. A major driver of the Bakersfield economy is the drilling and extraction of oil and natural gas. Since June 1, 2014, the price of crude oil has fallen from $105.37 a barrel to a closing price of $29.08 on February 1, 2016. Over this period a barrel of crude oil had fallen 72%. In addition, one of our communities in Bakersfield recently delivered a number of homes at gross margins much lower than what we consider normal and customary.\nThe impairment analysis procedures for real estate are a two-step process. In the first step we look at the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. As part of our annual and quarterly planning process we generate detailed financial projections for each of our communities. Our analysis includes, among other items, 3-year undiscounted projected cash flows. In the case of our River Run community in Bakersfield, our 3-year undiscounted cash flow projections indicated negative cash flows. As of December 31, 2015 the River Run community consisted of 15 completed homes of which three were sold and in backlog, eight were completed standing inventory (i.e. spec homes), and three were model homes. In addition to the homes, we owned 14 finished lots.\nAs a result of the negative undiscounted cash flow projections, we identified that an impairment existed. In order to determine the amount of the impairment, we discounted the projected cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. As a result of our impairment procedures, we recorded an impairment of $923,000 during the fourth quarter of 2015 on our real estate inventory at River Run, located in Bakersfield, California.\nLand Development Cost of Sales\nCost of sales in our land development reporting segment for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $10.2 million, or 40.0%, to $15.3 million, as compared to $25.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this decrease, $3.9 million related to the decrease in the number of lots sold and $6.2 million related to a decrease in the average cost per lot sold. Various factors can affect the cost of land sales including the status of land sold (e.g., fully entitled, improved or unimproved) and housing market conditions in the markets in which our land sales occur.\nGross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

margin are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. These metrics have been adjusted to add back capitalized interest, and impairment and abandonment charges. We use adjusted gross margin information as a supplemental measure when evaluating our operating performance. \nWe believe this information is meaningful, because it isolates the impact that leverage and non-cash impairment and abandonment charges have on gross margin. Management uses adjusted gross margin when comparing our results with competitors and versus our internal budgets since the components (e.g. construction costs, land costs, incentives, etc.) are controllable at the operational level. However, because adjusted gross margin information excludes interest expense and impairment and abandonment charges, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results, the utility of adjusted gross margin information as a measure of our operating performance is limited. In addition, other companies may not calculate gross margin information in the same manner that we do.\nAccordingly, adjusted gross margin information should be considered only as a supplement to gross margin information as a measure of our performance. The table above provides a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin numbers to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.\nConsolidated gross margin increased $18.2 million, or 54.5% to $51.5 million in 2015 from $33.3 million in 2014. In percentage terms, our gross margin increased 1.1% to 18.5% in 2015 from 17.4% in 2014.\nHomebuilding"}
