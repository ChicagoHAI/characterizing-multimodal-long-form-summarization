Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 42 full service branches located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2017, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $3.17 billion, total deposits of $2.38 billion, total loans held for investment of $2.09 billion (net of allowances) and total stockholders' equity of $374.1 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.6 million compared to $9.4 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million, or 120.3%.\nHistory and Background\nSince 2003, we have completed a series of thirteen acquisitions and two charter consolidations. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance stockholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. In conjunction with our strategic acquisition growth, we strive to reposition and improve the loan portfolio and deposit mix of the banks we acquire. Following our acquisitions, we focus on identifying and disposing of problematic loans and replacing them with higher quality loans generated organically. In addition, we have focused on growth in our commercial loan portfolio, which we believe generally offers higher return opportunities than our consumer loan portfolio, primarily by hiring additional talented bankers, particularly in our metropolitan markets, and incentivizing our bankers to expand their commercial banking relationships. We also seek to increase our most attractive deposit accounts primarily by growing deposits in our community markets and cross-selling our depository products to our loan customers.\nOur principal objective is to continue to increase stockholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe our targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which is strategically split between growing metropolitan markets, such as Kansas City, Tulsa and Wichita, and stable community markets within Western Kansas, Western Missouri, Topeka, Northern Arkansas and Northern Oklahoma, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth in our metropolitan markets. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our customers by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based customer service of a community bank.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Net income allocable to common stockholders of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million for the previous year ended December 31, 2016, a 120.3% increase.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total loans held for investment of $2.09 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $717.6 million, or 52.1%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total deposits of $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $751.6 million, or 46.1%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Total assets of $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.19 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $978.3 million, or 44.6%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Book value per common share of $25.62 at December 31, 2017, compared to $22.09 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.53, or 16.0%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Tangible book value per common share of $17.61 at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.64 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.97, or 5.9%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe completed our acquisition of Prairie State Bancshares, Inc.

( Cache\u201d) of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cache had total assets of $324.6 million, net loans of $308.3 million, and total deposits of $278.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in the December 31, 2017 notes to consolidated financial statements NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.\u201d We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity.\nLoans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of previous charge-offs and an allowance for loan losses, and for purchased loans, net of unamortized purchase premiums and discounts. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans: As a part of previous acquisitions, we acquired certain loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at the acquisition date fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Such purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nNonaccrual Loans: Generally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nImpaired Loans: A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or on the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings: In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan and classified as impaired. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is a troubled debt restructuring remains on nonaccrual until such time that repayment of the remaining principal and interest is not in doubt, and the borrower has a period of satisfactory repayment performance.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A loan review process, independent of the loan approval process, is utilized by management to verify loans are being made and administered in accordance with Company policy, to review loan risk grades and potential losses, to verify that potential problem loans are receiving adequate and timely corrective measures to avoid or reduce losses, and to assist in the verification of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio and class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by us. This actual loss experience is then adjusted by comparing current conditions to the conditions that existed during the loss history. We consider the changes related to (i) lending policies, (ii) economic conditions, (iii) nature and volume of the loan portfolio and class, (iv) lending staff, (v) volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and risk graded loans, (vi) loan review system, (vii) value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, (viii) concentration levels and (ix) effects of other external factors.\nGoodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets.\nCore Deposit Intangibles: Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method. The useful lives of the core deposits are estimated to generally be between seven and ten years.\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles are assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. We have selected December 31 as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\nEmerging Growth Company: Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We have irrevocably elected to adopt new accounting standards within the public company adoption period.\nWe may take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.\nResults of Operations\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses.\nChanges in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and stockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international circumstances and domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets.\nNet Income\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.6 million compared to $9.4 million for year ended December 31, 2016. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million, or 120.3%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, increases in net interest income of $33.4 million and non-interest income of $5.0 million were partially offset by $20.4 million in higher non-interest expenses and an increase of $834 thousand in the provision for loan loss when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of Results of Operations.\u201d\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.4 million compared to $10.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $750 thousand, or 7.4%. During the year ended December 31, 2016, increases in net interest income of $6.3 million, non-interest income of $664 thousand and a reduction of $928 thousand in the provision for loan loss were offset by $8.5 million in higher non-interest expenses when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of Results of Operations.\u201d\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a volume change,\u201d and it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a yield/rate change.\u201d\nThe following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Net Interest Analysis\nTable 186:

The increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the volume of interest-earnings assets and to a lesser extent an increase in yields on interest-earning assets. The increase in average volume of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in loans and investment securities partially offset by a decrease in Federal funds sold and other. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16.7 million, an increase of $7.5 million, or 81.4%, from the interest expense of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average volume and rates of interest bearing liabilities incurred to fund the increased volume of interest-earning assets.\nInterest income was $102.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $40.9 million, or 66.2%. Interest income on loans , including loan fees, was $85.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $35.4 million, or 70.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in loan interest income was driven by the increase in average loan volume and a 45 basis point increase in yield on the loan portfolio from 4.98% for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 5.43% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The impact to net interest income from loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest expense was $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $7.5 million from the $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.9 million from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Average certificates of deposit increased $195.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and the average rate increased from 1.07% to 1.18% for the same time period resulting in an increase in related interest expense of $2.8 million. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB increased by $8.7 million from an average balance of $250.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to an average balance of $259.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $1.5 million. Interest expense on our bank stock loan for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $16 thousand compared to $31 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 21 basis points to 0.88% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 0.67% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet interest margin, for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.83%, an increase of 53 basis points compared with 3.30% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest margin during 2017 is largely due to the increase in overall yield on interest earning assets. Also, during the first nine months of 2016, we utilized a leverage\u201d or spread\u201d opportunity. The spread opportunity involved borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets, such as money market accounts in other financial institutions, resulting in a decrease in net interest margin of 0.21% for 2016. We terminated the spread opportunity at September 30, 2016. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $33.4 million, an increase in average interest-earning assets of $653.0 million and an increase in net interest margin of 53 basis points.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $52.6 million compared with $46.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $6.3 million, or 13.7%. The increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the volume of interest-earnings assets partially offset by a decrease in yields on interest-earning assets. The increase in average volume of interest-earning assets was primarily due to increases in loans, investment securities and Federal funds sold and other. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.2 million, an increase of $2.4 million, or 36.0%, from the interest expense of $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the average volume and rates of interest bearing liabilities incurred to fund the increased volume of interest-earning assets.\nInterest income was $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $8.8 million, or 16.5%. Interest income on loans, including loan fees which consist of fees for loan origination, renewal, prepayment, covenant breakage and loan modification, was $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $6.9 million, or 15.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in loan interest income was driven by the increase in average loan volume; however, the yield on the loan portfolio decreased 33 basis points from 5.31% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 4.98% for the year ended December 31, 2016. Loan fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $2.4 million compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The primary driver of the decrease in loan yields is the origination or purchase of commercial, commercial real estate and mortgage loans in a low interest rate environment and the pay off of older higher yielding loans.\nInterest expense was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.4 million from the $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense on savings, NOW and money market deposits was $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $656 thousand from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Average certificates of deposit increased $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 and the average rate increased from 0.90% to 1.07% for the same time period resulting in an increase in related interest expense of $1.5 million. Average balances of borrowings from the FHLB increased by $92.5 million from an average balance of $157.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to an average balance of $250.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, resulting in an increase in interest expense of $905 thousand. In February 2015, we prepaid older higher cost FHLB term advances and began using the FHLB line of credit or LOC advance option, which is pre-payable without a fee and resulted in a much lower funding cost. Interest expense on our bank stock loan for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $31 thousand compared to $641 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. Total cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased six basis points to 0.67% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 0.61% for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet interest margin, for the year ended December 31, 2016 was 3.30%, a decrease of 35 basis points compared with 3.65% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin is largely the result of changes in mix and yield of interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The decline in our net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to our purchase of additional investment securities, our utilization of an available spread opportunity\u201d and the increase in our 1-4 family loan portfolio, which contributed to a decline in yield on our loan portfolio. The spread opportunity\u201d involved borrowing overnight on our line of credit with the FHLB and investing the proceeds in FHLB stock, federal funds sold and other overnight assets,\nsuch as money market accounts in other financial institutions, resulting in a decrease in net interest margin of 0.21% for 2016 and 0.10% for 2015. We utilized the spread opportunity to generate additional income. We terminated the spread opportunity at September 30, 2016. These changes for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted in an increase in net interest income of $6.3 million, an increase in average interest-earning assets of $324.4 million and a decrease in net interest margin of 35 basis points.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses for probable incurred credit losses. The allowance for loan losses is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is a charge to earnings, and subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, but is decreased by charge-offs when the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, discounted cash flows, economic conditions, and other factors including regulatory guidance. As these factors change, the amount of the loan loss provision changes.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.0 million compared with $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increased provision of $834 thousand was primarily related to the overall increase in volume in our loan portfolio during 2017. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $887 thousand compared to net charge-offs of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross charge-offs were $2.1 million offset by gross recoveries of $1.2 million. In comparison, gross charge-offs were $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 offset by gross recoveries of $527 thousand.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nThe provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2.1 million compared with $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decreased provision of $928 thousand was primarily related to decreased charge-offs and increased recoveries on loans as compared to the previous year. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $1.2 million compared to net charge-offs of $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross charge-offs were $1.7 million offset by gross recoveries of $527 thousand. In comparison, gross charge-offs were $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 offset by gross recoveries of $237 thousand.\nNon-Interest Income\nThe primary sources of non-interest income are service charges and fees, debit card income, mortgage banking income, increases in the value of bank owned life insurance, investment referral income, the recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, and net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions. Non-interest income does not include loan origination or other loan fees which are recognized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method.\nThe following table provides a comparison of the

$15.4 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 47.5%, from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in service charges and fees, debit card income, other, mortgage banking income, increase in value of bank owned life insurance and recovery on zero-basis purchased loans partially offset by decreases in net gains on sales of and settlement of securities and investment referral income. Service charges and fees increased $1.6 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same time period during 2016, mainly due to an increase in non-sufficient fund charges. Debit card income was $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.6 million, or 56.9%, from $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Mortgage banking increased largely due to an increase in proceeds received from investors on the sale of mortgage loans. In connection with acquisitions, we received the rights to certain loans that were previously charged off by the acquired bank. At acquisition, there was no expectation of future cash flows from these previously charged-off loans and thus they were assigned a zero basis. Subsequent to the acquisitions, we have received cash payments on several of these loans. No interest has been accrued as cash flow payments have not been expected prior to receipt. Cash receipts on these zero-basis loans totaled $319 thousand and $102 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017 gains on sales of and settlement of securities amounted to $271 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2016 gains on sales of and settlement of securities amounted to $893 thousand. During 2016, the Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment loss in the amount of $414 thousand, resulting in a net gain on sales of and settlement of securities of $479 thousand. The impairment loss reflected the difference between the amortized cost of the Company's investment in AgriBank's 9.125% subordinated notes, due July 2019 and the fair value attributed to AgriBank's redemption call of those notes.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, non-interest income totaled $10.5 million, an increase of $663 thousand, or 6.8%, from $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases in service charges and fees, debit card income, and mortgage banking income, partially offset by decreases in net gain on acquisition, recovery of zero-basis purchased loans, and net gains on sales of and settlement of securities. Service charges and fees increased $844 thousand during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same time period during 2015, mainly due to an increase in non-sufficient fund charges. Debit card income was $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $737 thousand, or 34.1%, from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Mortgage banking increased largely due to an increase in proceeds received from investors on the sale of mortgage loans. The recognized amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired, including deferred tax assets associated with NOL and tax credit carryforwards, exceeded the cash consideration exchanged in the First Independence acquisition resulting in the net gain on acquisition in 2015. In connection with acquisitions, we received the rights to certain loans that were previously charged off by the acquired bank. At acquisition, there was no expectation of future cash flows from these previously charged-off loans and thus they were assigned a zero basis. Subsequent to the acquisitions, we have received cash payments on several of these loans. No interest has been accrued as cash flow payments have not been expected prior to receipt. Cash receipts on\nthese zero-basis loans totaled $102 thousand and $393 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016 gains on sales of and settlement of securities amounted to $893 thousand.

$20.4 million, or 43.3%, compared to December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $12.0 million, other of $2.3 million, net occupancy and equipment of $1.7 million, data processing of $1.4 million, advertising and business development of $907 thousand and amortization of core deposit intangible of $612 thousand. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $34.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $12.0 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. There was a $8.4 million increase in salaries for year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to year ended December 31, 2016, which reflects the full year effect of the Community First merger, the March 2017 addition of staff related to the merger with Prairie, the November 2017 addition of staff related to the mergers with Eastman and Cache, as well as additions to corporate and operations staff indirectly attributable to acquisitions and our growth. In addition, during the same time period, there was an increase in benefits cost of $1.1 million. Included in salaries and employee benefits is share-based compensation expense of $552 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2017 and $268 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.6 million\nfor the year ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the increase is due to a full year of expenses related to the acquisition of Community First and the subsequent addition of five branches in Northern Arkansas. In addition, due to the acquisitions of Prairie, Eastman and Cache, there were three additional branches added in March 2017 and five additional branches added in November 2017.\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.4 million, or 38.1%, from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was principally due to increased debit card processing costs as usage increased.\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments, were $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $288 thousand, or 13.9%, principally is due to an increase in consulting fees of $130 thousand, legal fees of $110 thousand and regulatory assessments of $60 thousand partially offset by a decrease in accounting fees of $12 thousand.\nOther real estate owned: As detailed in NOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $644 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $121 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2016 other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $542 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $156 thousand.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets; losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nMerger expenses: Merger expenses include legal, advisory and accounting fees associated with services to facilitate the acquisition of other banks. Merger expenses also include data processing conversion costs and costs associated with the integration of personnel, processes, facilities and employee bonuses. On March 10, 2017, we acquired Prairie State Bancshares, Inc., based in Hoxie, Kansas. Merger expenses of $926 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017 are related to the Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. merger. On November 10, 2017, we acquired Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. based in Newkirk/Ponca City, Oklahoma. Merger expenses of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 are related to the Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. merger. Additionally, on November 10, 2017 we acquired Cache Holdings, Inc. based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Merger expenses of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 are related to the Cache Holdings, Inc. merger. On November 10, 2016, we acquired Community First Bancshares, Inc. based in Harrison, Arkansas. Merger expenses of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 are related to the Community First Bancshares, Inc. merger and $678 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, are related to the previously mentioned Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. merger.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: In the first quarter of 2016, we repaid our bank stock loan and wrote off the deferred debt issuance costs associated with this loan resulting in a $58 thousand loss on debt extinguishment.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, non-interest expense totaled $47.1 million, an increase of $8.5 million, or 22.0%, compared to December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases in merger expenses of $3.6 million, salaries and employee benefits of $2.7 million, data processing of $629 thousand, net occupancy and equipment of $431 thousand, telecommunications of $290 thousand, other expense of $223 thousand, loan expense of $211 thousand, and free nation-wide ATM costs of $204 thousand, partially offset by a decrease of $258 thousand in loss on extinguishment of debt. These items and other changes in the various components of non-interest expense are discussed in more detail below.\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and benefits were $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. There was a $2.3 million increase in salaries for year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to year ended December 31, 2015, which reflects the full year effect of the First Independence merger, the November 2016 addition of staff related to the merger with Community First, as well as additions to lending, customer service, and operations staff. In addition, during the same time period, there was an increase in benefits cost of $351 thousand. Included in salaries and employee benefits is stock based compensation expense of $268 thousand in the year ended December 31, 2016 and $162 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet occupancy and equipment: Net occupancy and equipment includes expenses related to the use of premises and equipment, such as depreciation, operating lease payments, repairs and maintenance, insurance, property taxes and utilities, net of incidental rental income of excess facilities. Occupancy expenses were $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The majority of the increase is due to a full year of expenses related to the acquisition of First\nIndependence and the subsequent addition of four branches in Southeast Kansas. In addition, due to the acquisition of Community First, there were five additional branches added in November 2016.\nData processing: Data processing expenses were $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $629 thousand, or 21.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was principally due to increased debit card processing costs as usage increased.\nProfessional fees: Professional fees, including regulatory assessments, were $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $11 thousand, or 0.5%, principally is due to a decrease in legal fees of $135 thousand and consulting fees of $66 thousand, offset by an increase in accounting fees of $135 thousand and an increase in other professional fees of $55 thousand. The decrease in legal fees was primarily due to the settlement of the lawsuit with U.S. Bank in June 2015, as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financials Statements, NOTE 23 - LEGAL MATTERS.\u201d The offsetting increases in professional fees are principally attributable to the reporting requirements of being a public company.\nOther real estate owned: As detailed in NOTE 5 - OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $542 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $156 thousand. For the year ended December 31, 2015 other real estate owned expenses, including provision for unrealized losses were $418 thousand offset by gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $131 thousand.\nOther: Other non-interest expenses, which consist of subscriptions; memberships and dues; employee expenses including travel, meals, entertainment and education; supplies; printing; insurance; account related losses; correspondent bank fees; customer program expenses; losses net of gains on the sale of fixed assets; losses net of gains on the sale of repossessed assets other than real estate; and other operating expenses such as settlement of claims, were $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nMerger expenses: Merger expenses include legal, advisory and accounting fees associated with services to facilitate the acquisition of other banks. Merger expenses also include data processing conversion costs and costs associated with the integration of personnel, processes, facilities and employee bonuses. On November 10, 2016, we acquired Community First Bancshares, Inc., based in Harrison, Arkansas. Merger expenses of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 are mostly related to this merger. On October 9, 2015, we acquired First Independence Corporation and its subsidiary, First Federal Savings & Loan of Independence, based in Independence, Kansas. Merger expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 are related to this merger.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt: In the first quarter of 2016, we repaid our bank stock loan and wrote off the deferred debt issuance costs associated with this loan resulting in a $58 thousand loss on debt extinguishment. In the first quarter of 2015, we chose to incur a $316 thousand loss on extinguishment of debt due to the prepayment of all our FHLB term advances. The weighted average rate of the FHLB term advances was 3.82%.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe efficiency ratio is a supplemental financial measure utilized in the internal evaluation of our performance and is not defined under GAAP. Our efficiency ratio is computed by dividing non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and loss on debt extinguishment by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, excluding net gains on sales of and settlement of securities and gain on acquisition. Generally, an increase in the efficiency ratio indicates that more resources are being utilized to generate the same volume of income, while a decrease would indicate a more efficient allocation of resources. The ratio defined under GAAP that is most comparable to the efficiency ratio is non-interest expense to net interest income plus non-interest income which is discussed in Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d\nThe Company's non-interest expense to net interest income plus non-interest income was 66.50% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 74.65% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This improvement was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income, partially offset by increased non-interest expense as discussed in Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d Our efficiency ratio was 61.39% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 66.67% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This improvement was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income as discussed in Results of Operations - Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\u201d and Results of Operations - Non-Interest Income.\u201d\nThe Company's non-interest expense to net interest income plus non-interest income was 74.65% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 68.81% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decline was primarily due to increased non-interest expense, partially offset by increased net interest income and non-interest income as discussed in Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d Our efficiency ratio was 66.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 66.9% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015. This improvement was primarily due to increased net interest income and non-interest income as discussed in Results of Operations - Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\u201d and Results of Operations - Non-Interest Income.\u201d\nIncome Taxes\nThe amount of income tax expense is influenced by the amount of pre-tax income, the amount of tax-exempt income, the amount non-deductible expenses and available tax credits.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, income tax expense was $10.4 million compared with $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were 33.5% and 32.4%, as compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. As detailed in NOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits. In addition, beginning with the first quarter 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, excess tax benefits, generated when the tax return deductible compensation expense exceeds cumulative compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes, have been recorded in the period in which they occur. Prior to adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options were recognized as additional paid in capital. The 2017 provision for income taxes also includes a fourth quarter charge of $1.1 million related to Tax Reform. The reduction of the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, provided for by Tax Reform, resulted in the re-measurement of the Company's net deferred tax assets.\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, income tax expense was $4.5 million compared with $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 32.4% and 28.7%, as compared to the U.S. statutory rate of 35.0%. As detailed in NOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the income tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to non-taxable income, non-deductible expenses and tax credits.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation or recession.\nUnlike many industrial companies, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. However, other operating expenses do reflect general levels of inflation.\nFinancial Condition\nOverview\nOur total assets increased $978.3 million, or 44.6%, from $2.19 billion at December 31, 2016, to $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in total assets was primarily from increases in net loans of $717.6 million, $136.3 million in investment securities, $46.0 million in goodwill, $20.3 million in bank owned life insurance, $16.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, $12.9 million in premises and equipment, $11.5 million in loans held for sale, $7.7 million in Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock, $6.0 million in core deposit intangibles and $5.4 million in interest receivable. Included in the above changes are the assets of Prairie, Eastman and Cache, which totaled $153.1 million, $281.5 million and $343.4 million at acquisition. Our total liabilities increased $862.1 million, or 44.6%, from $1.93 billion at December 31, 2016 to $2.80 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in total liabilities was primarily from increases in total deposits of $751.6 million, FHLB advances of $88.1 million, federal funds purchased and retail repurchase agreements of $16.9 million, interest payable and other liabilities of $3.4 million, bank stock loan of $2.5 million and subordinated debentures of $284 thousand, partially offset by decreases of $537 thousand in contractual obligations. Our total stockholders' equity increased $116.2 million, or 45.0%, from $258.0 million at December 31, 2016 to $374.1 million at December 31, 2017.\nLoan Portfolio\nLoans are our largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than other types of earning assets. At December 31, 2017, our gross loans held for investment portfolio totaled $2.10 billion, an increase of $719.7 million, or 52.0%, compared with December 31, 2016. Excluding acquisitions of Prairie, Eastman and Cache, gross loans held for investment increased by $124.5 million, or 9.0%, compared with December 31, 2016. Overall growth consisted of $322.7 million or 67.4% from commercial real estate, $159.1 million or 45.6% from commercial and industrial, $71.9 million or 62.9% from real estate construction, $71.1 million or 291.4% from agricultural, $48.2 million or 125.6% from agricultural real estate, $38.3 million or 11.3% from residential real estate and $8.5 million or 20.7% from consumer. We also had loans classified as held for sale totaling $16.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, most of which are made to borrowers located in the Wichita, Kansas City and Tulsa MSAs, as well as various community markets throughout Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Although the portfolio is diversified and generally secured by various types of collateral, the majority of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans and a substantial portion of our borrowers' ability to honor their obligations is dependent on local economic conditions in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2017, there was no concentration of loans to any one type of industry exceeding 10% of total loans.\nAt December 31, 2017, gross total loans were 88.3% of deposits and 66.3% of total assets. At December 31, 2016, gross total loans were 84.9% of deposits and 63.1% of total assets.\nThe organic, or non-acquired, growth in our loan portfolio is attributable to our ability to attract new customers from other financial institutions and overall growth in our markets. Our lending staff has been successful in building banking relationships with new customers. Several new lenders have been hired in our markets, and these employees have been successful in transitioning their former clients and attracting new clients. Lending activities originate from the efforts of our lenders, with an emphasis on lending to individuals, professionals, small to medium-sized businesses and commercial companies located in the Wichita, Kansas City and Tulsa MSAs, as well as community markets in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma.\nThe following table summarizes our loan portfolio by type of loan as of the dates

needs of the business. Our commercial and industrial portfolio totaled $507.5 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $159.1 million, or 45.6%, compared to December 31, 2016. Of this growth, $12.2 million, or 7.7%, was a result of loans acquired through Prairie, $38.2 million, or 24.0%, was a result of loans acquired through Eastman, and $83.5 million, or 52.5%, was a result of loans acquired through Cache. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target markets and changes in the balances of revolving lines of credit, partially offset by reductions of broadly syndicated shared national credit originations and mortgage finance loan participations.\nCommercial real estate: Commercial real estate loans include all loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties and by multifamily residential properties, as well as 1-4 family investment-purpose real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans were $801.5 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $322.7 million, or 67.4%, compared to December 31, 2016. Of this growth, $73.3 million, or 22.7%, was a result of loans acquired through Eastman and $147.8 million, or 45.8%, was a result of loans acquired through Cache. The remainder was a combination of loan originations within our target market and changes in the balances of revolving lines of credit.\nReal estate construction: Real estate construction loans include loans made for the purpose of acquisition, development, or construction of real property, both commercial and consumer. Our real estate construction portfolio totaled $186.2 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $71.9 million, or 62.9%, compared to December 31, 2016. The increase in real estate construction loans is primarily related to $3.9 million in real estate construction loans acquired through Eastman, $52.3 million in real estate construction loans acquired through Cache and increased originations.\nResidential real estate: Residential real estate loans include loans secured by primary or secondary personal residences. Our residential real estate portfolio totaled $376.7 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $38.3 million, or 11.3%, compared to December 31, 2016. The acquisitions of Prairie, Eastman and Cache added $137 thousand, $37.3 million and $2.0 million in residential real estate loans as of December 31, 2017. Also during 2017, we purchased one $14.8 million pool of mortgage loans. These increases were offset by payment activity in the existing residential real estate loans. During 2016, we purchased two pools of mortgage loans totaling $38.4 million. These pools of mortgages were purchased to expand our loan portfolio and provide additional loan income.\nAgricultural real estate, Agricultural, Consumer and other: Agricultural real estate loans are loans related to farmland. Agricultural loans are primarily operating lines subject to annual farming revenues including productivity/yield of the agricultural commodities produced. Consumer loans are generally secured by consumer assets, but may be unsecured. These three loan pools represent 11.0% of our overall loan portfolio.\nThe contractual maturity ranges of loans in our loan portfolio and the amount of such loans with predetermined interest rates and floating rates in each maturity range as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are summarized in the following tables.\nLoan Maturity and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nTable 196:

loans on nonaccrual status, accruing loans 90 or more days past due, restructured loans, and other real estate acquired through foreclosure.\nWe had $40.3 million in nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017, compared with $22.7 million at December 31, 2016. The nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 consisted of 307 separate credits and 223 separate borrowers. We had seven nonperforming loan relationships each with outstanding balances exceeding $1.0 million as of December 31, 2017. Of the increase in nonperforming assets, $16.7 million was the direct result of the Prairie, Eastman and Cache mergers. There are several procedures in place to assist us in maintaining the overall quality of our loan portfolio. We have established underwriting guidelines to be followed by lenders, and also monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends. There can be no assurance, however, that our loan portfolio will not become subject to increasing pressures from deteriorating borrower credit due to general economic conditions.\nPotential Problem Loans\nWe categorize loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. Loans are analyzed individually and classified based on credit risk. Consumer loans are considered pass credits unless downgraded due to payment status or reviewed as part of a larger credit relationship. We use the following definitions for risk ratings:\nPass: Loans classified as pass do not have any noted weaknesses and repayment of the loan is expected. These loans are considered unclassified.\nSpecial Mention: Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of our credit position at some future date. These loans are considered classified.\nSubstandard: Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. These loans are considered classified.\nDoubtful: Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. These loans are considered classified.\nPotential problem loans consist of loans that are performing in accordance with contractual terms, but for which management has concerns about the borrower's ability to comply with repayment terms because of the borrower's potential financial difficulties. Potential problem loans are assigned a grade of special mention or substandard. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $21.1 million in potential problem loans which were not included in either non-accrual or 90 days past due categories, compared to $9.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows for December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nRisk Category of Loans by Class\nTable 199: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As

of total loans at December 31, 2016. Classified loans were $61.4 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $29.2 million, or 90.5%, from $32.2 million at December 31, 2016. Approximately $22.8 million of the increase was a direct result of the Prairie, Eastman and Cache mergers.\nGenerally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nIn accordance with applicable regulation, appraisals or evaluations are required to independently value real estate and, as an important element, to consider when underwriting loans secured in part or in whole by real estate. The value of real estate collateral provides additional support to the borrower's credit capacity.\nWith respect to potential problem loans, all monitored and under-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated to determine if they are impaired. If we determine that a loan is impaired, then we evaluate the borrower's overall financial condition to determine the need, if any, for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses based on the unlikelihood of full repayment of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms or the net realizable value of the pledged collateral.\nAllowance for loan losses\nPlease see Critical Accounting Policies - Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d for additional discussion of our allowance policy.\nIn connection with our review of the loan portfolio, risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories are considered when assessing the quality of individual loans. Some of the risk elements include:\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial and industrial loans are dependent on the strength of the industries of the related borrowers and the success of their businesses. Commercial and industrial loans are advanced for equipment purchases, to provide working capital, or meet other financing needs of the business.

Financial information is obtained from the borrower to evaluate the debt service coverage and ability to repay the loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Commercial real estate loans are dependent on the industries tied to these loans as well as the local commercial real estate market.

Residential real estate loans are affected by the local residential real estate market, the local economy, and movement in interest rates. We evaluate the borrower's repayment ability through a review of credit reports and debt to income ratios. Appraisals are obtained to support the loan amount.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Agricultural real estate loans are real estate loans related to farmland, and are affected by the value of farmland.

These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nThe table below shows the contractually required principal loan payments and the associated purchase discount on our purchased credit impaired portfolio.\nRecorded Investment in Purchased Credit Impaired Loans\nTable 206: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractually required payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,492\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,914\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,794\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded investment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of allowance for loan and lease losses: At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses totaled $8.5 million, or 0.40% of total loans. At December 31, 2016 the allowance for loan losses aggregated $6.4 million, or 0.46% of total loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses on loans collectively evaluated for impairment totaled $7.6 million, or 0.36%, of the $2.09 billion in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2017, compared to an allowance for loan losses of $5.8 million, or 0.42%, of the $1.37 billion in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2016, and an allowance for loan losses of $5.2 million, or 0.55%, of the $948.9 million in loans collectively evaluated for impairment at December 31, 2015. The decrease in allowance as a percentage of loans collectively evaluated for impairment from December 31, 2016, to December 31, 2017, was largely due to $533.7 million in loans which were purchased at a discount as part of mergers during 2017. The decrease in allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans collectively evaluated for impairment from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, was primarily related to a change in applied loss factors which are based in part on historical loss experience as well as changes in the composition and quality of our loan portfolio collectively evaluated for impairment. The changes in composition included purchased loans, outside of business combinations, which have different characteristics than our originated loan portfolio at December 31, 2015.\nNet losses as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.06% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 0.12% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, and 0.43% for the twelve months ended

the loan portfolio as of such date. There can be no assurance, however, that we will not sustain losses in future periods, which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance at December 31, 2017.\nSecurities\nWe use our securities portfolio to provide a source of liquidity, to provide an appropriate return on funds invested, to manage interest rate risk, to meet pledging requirements and to meet regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2017, the carrying amount of investment securities totaled $697.7 million, an increase of $136.3 million, or 24.3%, compared with December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, securities represented 22.0% of total assets compared with 25.6% at December 31, 2016.\nAt the date of purchase, debt and equity securities are classified into one of two categories, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. We do not purchase securities for trading purposes. At each reporting date, the appropriateness of the classification is reassessed. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts, in the financial statements only if management has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale and measured at fair value in the financial statements with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, as accumulated comprehensive income or loss until realized. Interest earned on securities is included in total interest and dividend income. Also included in total interest and dividend income are dividends received on stock investments in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the FHLB of Topeka. These stock investments are stated at cost.\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair value by classification of available-for-sale securities as of the dates

</tr>\n</table>\nMortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages and which are principally issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Unlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Premiums and discounts on mortgage-backed securities are amortized and accreted over the expected life of the security and may be impacted by prepayments. As such, mortgage-backed securities which are purchased at a premium will generally produce decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages resulting in prepayments and an acceleration of premium amortization. Securities purchased at a discount will reflect higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment as prepayments result in an acceleration of discount accretion.\nThe contractual maturity of mortgage-backed securities is not a reliable indicator of their expected lives because borrowers have the right to prepay their obligations at any time. Monthly pay downs on mortgage-backed securities cause the average lives of these securities to be much different than their stated lives. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 93.0% and 96.0% of the mortgage-backed securities held by us had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of 5.5 years and 5.4 years and a modified duration of 4.8 years and 4.8 years.\nDeposits\nOur lending and investing activities are primarily funded by deposits. A variety of deposit accounts are offered with a wide range of interest rates and terms including demand, savings, money market and time deposits. We rely primarily on competitive pricing policies, convenient locations, comprehensive marketing strategy and personalized service to attract and retain these deposits.\nThe following table shows our composition of deposits at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nComposition of Deposits\nTable 216: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td>

As part of the Prairie merger we assumed non-interest-bearing deposits of $30.8 million, interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $3.1 million, savings and money market deposits of $46.2 million and time deposits of $45.3 million. As part of the Eastman merger we assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $73.8 million, interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $36.8 million, savings and money market deposits of $86.5 million and time deposits of $27.0 million. In relation to the Cache merger we assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $26.1 million, interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts of $60.5 million, savings and money market deposits of $59.9 million and time deposits of $132.1 million. The increases in savings and money market deposits, non-interest-bearing demand deposits and time deposits, excluding the impact of the mergers, are partially offset by a decrease in interest-bearing demand deposits. The increases are due to the addition of new public-fund customers, the increase in existing public-fund customer balances and our ongoing business development efforts\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2016 were $1.63 billion, an increase of $414.5 million, or 34.1%, compared to December 31, 2015.

As part of the Community First merger we assumed non-interest-bearing demand deposits of $53.4 million, interest-bearing demand and NOW deposits of $160.5 million, savings and money market deposits of $64.1 million and time deposits of $97.5 million. The increases in time deposits and interest-bearing demand and NOW accounts, excluding the impact of the merger, are primarily due to the addition of new public-fund customers and the increase in existing public-fund customer balances in these deposit products. The increases in savings and money market deposits and non-interest-bearing demand deposits, excluding the impact of the merger, are due to our ongoing business development efforts.\nIncluded in savings and money market deposits at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are brokered deposit balances of $23.2 million, $2.7 million, and $3.9 million. These balances represent customer funds placed in the Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) service that allows Equity Bank to break large money-market deposits into smaller amounts and place them in a network of other ICS banks to ensure that FDIC insurance coverage is gained on the entire deposit. Although classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes, funds placed through the ICS service are Equity Bank's customer relationships that management views as core funding. Brokered certificates of deposit as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $63.0 million, $5.4 million, and $4.2 million. Of these balances, $63.0 million at December 31, 2017, $5.4 million at December 31, 2016 and $4.2 million at December 31, 2015 were customer funds placed in the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS\u201d) program.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no federal funds purchased outstanding. Retail repurchase agreements outstanding represent the purchase of interests in securities by banking customers. Retail repurchase agreements are stated at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction. We do not account for any of our repurchase agreements as sales for accounting purposes in our financial statements. Repurchase agreements with banking customers are settled on the following business day. Retail repurchase agreements are secured by investment securities held by us totaling $44.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $23.4 million at December 31, 2016. The agreements are on a day-to-day basis and can be terminated on demand. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had retail repurchase agreements with banking customers of $37.5 million and $20.6 million.\nFHLB advances: FHLB advances include both draws against our line of credit and fixed rate term advances. Each term advance is payable in full at its maturity date and contains provision for prepayment penalties. At December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 we had no term advances with the FHLB. The Company acquired $1.3 million in term advances in the November 2017 Cache merger which were paid later the same month. There were no term advances during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our FHLB borrowings are used for operational liquidity needs for originating and purchasing loans, purchasing investments and general operating cash requirements. Our FHLB borrowings were collateralized by certain qualifying loans totaling $479.0 million at December 31, 2017. Based on this collateral and our holdings of FHLB stock, we were eligible to borrow an additional $125.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nBank stock loan: At January 1, 2016, we had an outstanding balance of $18.6 million on a fixed rate 4.00% loan (computed on the basis of a 360 day year and the actual number of days elapsed) from an unaffiliated financial institution, secured by our stock in Equity Bank. This borrowing was repaid on January 4, 2016 using proceeds from our initial public offering ( IPO\u201d).\nOn January 28, 2016, we entered into a new agreement with the same lender that provided for a maximum borrowing facility of $20.0 million, secured by our stock in Equity Bank. At December 31, 2016, there was no outstanding balance on this loan. The borrowing facility matured on January 26, 2017 and was subsequently extended, at which time we entered into a new agreement with the same lender that provides for a maximum borrowing facility of $30.0 million, secured by our stock in Equity Bank. The borrowing facility was recently renewed for an additional year and will mature on March 13, 2019. Each draw of funds on the facility will create a separate note that is repayable over a term of five years. Each note will bear interest at a variable interest rate equal to the Prime Rate published in the Money Rates\u201d section of The Wall Street Journal (or any generally recognized successor), floating daily. Accrued interest and principal payments are due quarterly with one final payment of unpaid principal and interest due at the end of the five year term of each separate note. We are also required to pay an unused commitment fee in an amount equal to twenty basis points per annum on the unused portion of the maximum borrowing facility. The terms of the loan require us and Equity Bank to maintain minimum capital ratios and other covenants. The loan and accrued interest may be pre-paid at any time without penalty. In the event\nof default, the lender has the option to declare all outstanding balances as immediately due. At December 31, 2017, we had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million on this loan at a rate of 4.5%.\nSubordinated debentures: In conjunction with the 2012 acquisition of First Community, we assumed certain subordinated debentures owed to special purpose unconsolidated subsidiaries that are controlled by us, FCB Capital Trust II and FCB Capital Trust III, ( CTII\u201d and CTIII,\u201d respectively). The trust preferred securities issued by CTII accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 2.00% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on April 15, 2035 or upon earlier redemption. The trust preferred securities issued by CTIII accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 1.89% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on June 15, 2037 or upon earlier redemption.\nIn conjunction with the 2016 acquisition of Community First Bancshares, Inc., we assumed certain subordinated debentures owed to special purpose unconsolidated subsidiaries that are controlled by us, Community First (AR) Statutory Trust I, ( CFSTI\u201d). The trust preferred securities issued by CFSTI accrue and pay distributions quarterly at three-month LIBOR plus 3.25% on the stated liquidation amount of the trust preferred securities. These trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity on December 26, 2032 or upon earlier redemption.\nThe subordinated debentures balance, including CTII, CTIII and CFSTI, was $14.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $13.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nMarket and public confidence in our financial strength and financial institutions in general will largely determine access to appropriate levels of liquidity. This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital reserves.\nLiquidity is defined as the ability to meet anticipated customer demands for future funds under credit commitments and deposit withdrawals at a reasonable cost and on a timely basis. We measure our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on- and off-balance sheet sources of and demands for funds on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.\nLiquidity risk involves the risk of being unable to fund assets with the appropriate duration and rate-based liabilities, as well as the risk of not being able to meet unexpected cash needs. Liquidity planning and management are necessary to ensure the ability to fund operations in a cost-effective manner and to meet current and future potential obligations such as loan commitments, lease obligations, and unexpected deposit outflows. In this process, we focus on both assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 our liquidity needs have primarily been met by core deposits, security and loan maturities and amortizing investment and loan portfolios. Other funding sources include federal funds purchased, retail repurchase agreements, brokered certificates of deposit, borrowings from the FHLB, in 2015 the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering or IPO and in 2016 issuance of common stock in private placement.\nOur largest sources of funds are FHLB borrowings and deposits and our largest uses of funds are the origination or purchases of loans and securities purchases. Average loans were $1.58 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 56.1% over average loans of $1.01 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excess deposits are primarily invested in our interest-bearing deposit account with the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities, federal funds sold or other short-term liquid investments until the funds are needed to fund loan growth. Our securities portfolio has a weighted average life of 5.8 years and a modified duration of 5.1 years at December 31, 2017. In January 2016, $35.0 million of the proceeds from our November 2015 initial public offering were used to repay the bank stock loan of $18.6 million and to repurchase the Series C Preferred Stock at liquidation preference of $16.4 million. We believe that our daily funding needs can be met through cash provided by operating activities, payments and maturities on loans and investment securities, our core deposit base and FHLB advances and other borrowing relationships. In January 2016, we entered into a lending agreement with another financial institution providing for a maximum borrowing capacity of $20.0 million. The borrowing facility matured on January 26, 2017 and was subsequently extended, at which time we entered into a new agreement with the same lender that provides for a maximum borrowing capacity of $30.0 million. This agreement, which is secured by Equity Bank stock, can be used to fund future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. The outstanding balance on this borrowing facility was $2.5 million for the period ending December 31, 2017.\nCash Flow Overview\nCash and cash equivalents were $52.2 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $17.1 million from the $35.1 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.6 million and the net cash provided by financing activities of $212.4 million were offset by the $222.4 million use of cash and cash equivalents for investing purposes, resulting in net proceeds of cash and cash equivalents of $17.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net cash used in investing activities was principally related to loan portfolio growth, purchase of investment securities in excess of the cash flows generated by maturities, pay-downs, calls and sales of and settlement of securities and purchase of additional bank owned life insurance. During 2017 liquidity provided by operating activities, FHLB borrowings and deposit growth were used to grow loans by $125.2 million and purchase additional investment securities of $74.5 million, purchase additional FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock of $4.3 million and purchase premise and equipment of $6.9 million. The purchase of net non-cash assets of Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. and Cache Holdings, Inc. used $6.7 million and $2.9 million which was funded by available cash, cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million from the purchase of Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. and $2.5 million additional borrowings on the bank stock loan.\nCash and cash equivalents were $35.1 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $21.7 million from the $56.8 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2015. The net cash provided by operating activities of $15.5 million and the net cash provided by financing activities of $103.4 million were offset by the $140.7 million use of cash and cash equivalents for investing purposes, resulting in net proceeds of cash and cash equivalents of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net cash used in investing activities was principally related to loan portfolio growth , the purchase of investment securities in excess of the cash flows generated by maturities, pay-downs, call and sales of and settlement of securities and purchase of additional bank owned life insurance. During 2016 liquidity provided by operating activities, FHLB borrowings and deposit growth were used to grow loans by $73.9 million and purchase additional investment securities of $48.2 million, purchase additional FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock of $2.0 million and purchase premise and equipment of $2.8 million. The purchase of net non-cash assets of Community First Bancshares, Inc. used $3.0 million of cash and cash equivalents which was funded by available cash and $6.0 million of additional borrowings on the bank stock loan.\nCash and cash equivalents were $56.8 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $25.1 million from the $31.7 million cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014. The net cash provided by operating activities of $13.6 million plus the net cash provided by financing activities of $278.4 million were offset by the $266.9 million use of cash and cash equivalents for investing purposes, resulting in net proceeds of cash and cash equivalents of $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net cash used in investing activities was principally related to loan portfolio growth and the purchase of investment securities in excess of the cash flows generated by maturities, pay-downs, call and sales of and settlement of securities. During 2015 liquidity provided by operating activities, FHLB borrowings and deposit growth were used to grow loans by $150.6 million and purchase additional investment securities of $99.7 million, purchase additional FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock of $4.9 million and purchase premise and equipment of $5.7 million. The purchase of net non-cash assets of First Independence used $9.0 million of cash and cash equivalents which was funded by available cash and $5.0 million of additional borrowings on the bank stock loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Items\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. Our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amounts of these commitments. The same credit policies and procedures are used in making these commitments as for on-balance sheet instruments.\nOur commitments associated with outstanding standby and performance letters of credit and commitments to extend credit expiring by period as of December 31, 2017 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements:\nCredit Extensions and Commitments\nDecember 31, 2017\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n1 Year but Less\nThan 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 Years or\nMore but Less\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\nor More\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby and performance letters of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 224,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 358,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 366,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStandby and Performance Letters of Credit: Standby letters of credit are irrevocable commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party once specified pre-conditions are met. Financial standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. Performance standby letters of credit are issued to guarantee performance of certain customers under non-financial contractual obligations. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers.\nCommitments to Extend Credit: Commitments to originate loans and available lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments and lines of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments and lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment and lines of credit amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, commercial real estate, and residential real estate. Mortgage loans in the process of origination represent amounts that we plan to fund within a normal period of 60 to 90 days, and which are intended for sale to investors in the secondary market.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2017 (other than securities sold under repurchase agreements). These obligations consist of our future cash payments associated with contractual obligations pursuant to FHLB advances, time deposit contracts, borrowed funds, and non-cancelable future operating leases. Payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in underlying contracts.\nOther contractual obligations represent commitments made by us to make capital investments in limited-liability entities that invest in qualified affordable housing projects. Payments on these obligations are made as requested by the managers of the limited-liability entities, however the table below includes an estimate of the anticipated timing of payments pursuant to these commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nDecember 31, 2017\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\nor Less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n1 Year but\nLess Than\n3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 Years or\nMore but\nLess\nThan\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years or\nMore\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Certificates and other time deposits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 503,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 181,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 90,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 776,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debentures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB advances\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 347,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligation commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancelable future operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 852,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 182,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 91,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,144,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Resources\nCapital management consists of providing equity to support our current and future operations. The federal bank regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institution's financial soundness. As a general matter, FDIC-insured depository institutions and their holding companies are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold. As a bank holding company and a state-chartered-Fed-member bank, the Company and Equity Bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements.\nCapital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action. Management believes as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company and Equity Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.\nPrompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. If undercapitalized, capital distributions are limited, as are asset growth and acquisitions, and capital restoration plans are required.\nFailure to meet capital guidelines could subject the institution to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies, including termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the FDIC as conservator or receiver. As of December 31, 2017, the most recent notifications from the federal regulatory agencies categorized Equity Bank as well capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, Equity Bank must maintain minimum total capital, Tier 1 capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed Equity Bank's category.\nTotal stockholders' equity was $374.1 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $116.2 million, or 45.0%, compared with December 31, 2016. The increase was principally attributable to common stock issuance as part of the mergers with Prairie State Bancshares, Inc., Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. and Cache Holdings, Inc., net of issuance expenses of $14.9 million, $38.8 million and $39.2 million, retained earnings of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, common stock issued upon exercise of stock options of $1.2 million, stock based compensation of $1.1 million and change in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $145 thousand.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations under Basel III. These rules became effective as applied to the Company and Equity Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. The following table provides a comparison of the Company's and Equity Bank's leverage and risk-weighted capital ratios as of December 31, 2017, to the minimum and well-capitalized regulatory standards.\nCapital Adequacy Analysis\nDecember 31, 2017\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Minimum\nRequired for\nCapital Adequacy\nUnder

measures.\u201d In accordance with the SEC's rules, we classify a financial measure as being a non-GAAP financial measure if that financial measure excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding or including amounts, that are included or excluded, as the case may be, in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect from time to time in the United States in our statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures do not include operating and other statistical measures or ratios or statistical measures calculated using exclusively either financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, operating measures or other measures that are not non-GAAP financial measures or both.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which we calculate the non-GAAP financial measures that we discuss in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names. You should understand how such other banking organizations calculate their financial measures similar or with names similar to the non-GAAP financial measures we have discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when comparing such non-GAAP financial measures.\nTangible Book Value Per Common Share and Tangible Book Value Per Diluted Common Share: Tangible book value is a non-GAAP measure generally used by financial analysts and investment bankers to evaluate financial institutions. We calculate: (a) tangible common equity as total stockholders' equity less preferred stock, goodwill, core deposit intangibles, net of accumulated amortization, mortgage servicing asset, net of accumulated amortization and naming rights, net of accumulated amortization; (b) tangible book value per common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding; and (c) tangible book value per diluted common share as tangible common equity (as described in clause (a)) divided by shares of common stock outstanding plus the period-end dilutive effects of vested restricted stock units and the assumed exercise of stock options and redemption of non-vested restricted stock units. For tangible book value, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP is book value.\nManagement believes that these measures are important to many investors who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per common share exclusive of changes in intangible assets.

The GAAP-based efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses divided by net interest income plus non-interest income.\nIn management's judgment, the adjustments made to non-interest expense and non-interest income allow investors and analysts to better assess operating expenses in relation to operating revenue by removing merger expenses, loss on debt extinguishment, net gains on the sale of available-for-sale securities and other securities transactions, and the net gain on acquisition.\nThe following table reconciles, as of the dates set forth below, the efficiency ratio to the GAAP-based efficiency ratio.\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: merger expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: loss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense, excluding merger expenses and\nloss on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 36,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,466\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: net gains on sales and settlement of securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: net gain on acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income, excluding net gains on security\ntransactions and on acquisition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense to net interest income plus\nnon-interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.65\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.81\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.24\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.52\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Efficiency Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.39\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.94\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.67\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.26\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the bank holding company's financial condition and results of operations.

Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation includes the following sections:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical estimates and assumptions; \n \u2022 Results of Operations - an analysis of our operating results, including disclosures about the sustainability of our earnings; \n \u2022 Financial Condition - an analysis of our financial position; \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of our cash flows and capital position; and \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures - reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. \nOverview\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 42 full service branches located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2017, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $3.17 billion, total deposits of $2.38 billion, total loans held for investment of $2.09 billion (net of allowances) and total stockholders' equity of $374.1 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.6 million compared to $9.4 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million, or 120.3%.\nHistory and Background\nSince 2003, we have completed a series of thirteen acquisitions and two charter consolidations. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance stockholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. In conjunction with our strategic acquisition growth, we strive to reposition and improve the loan portfolio and deposit mix of the banks we acquire. Following our acquisitions, we focus on identifying and disposing of problematic loans and replacing them with higher quality loans generated organically. In addition, we have focused on growth in our commercial loan portfolio, which we believe generally offers higher return opportunities than our consumer loan portfolio, primarily by hiring additional talented bankers, particularly in our metropolitan markets, and incentivizing our bankers to expand their commercial banking relationships. We also seek to increase our most attractive deposit accounts primarily by growing deposits in our community markets and cross-selling our depository products to our loan customers.\nOur principal objective is to continue to increase stockholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe our targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which is strategically split between growing metropolitan markets, such as Kansas City, Tulsa and Wichita, and stable community markets within Western Kansas, Western Missouri, Topeka, Northern Arkansas and Northern Oklahoma, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth in our metropolitan markets. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our customers by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based customer service of a community bank.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n \u2022 Net income allocable to common stockholders of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million for the previous year ended December 31, 2016, a 120.3% increase. \n \u2022 Total loans held for investment of $2.09 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $717.6 million, or 52.1%. \n \u2022 Total deposits of $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $751.6 million, or 46.1%. \n \u2022 Total assets of $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.19 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $978.3 million, or 44.6%. \n \u2022 Book value per common share of $25.62 at December 31, 2017, compared to $22.09 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.53, or 16.0%. \n \u2022 Tangible book value per common share of $17.61 at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.64 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.97, or 5.9%. \nWe completed our acquisition of Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. ( Prairie\u201d) of Hoxie, Kansas on March 10, 2017. Prairie had total assets of $153.1 million, net loans of $130.1 million, and total deposits of $125.4 million. On November 10, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. ( Eastman\u201d) of Newkirk/Ponca City, Oklahoma. Eastman had total assets of $259.7 million, net loans of $177.9 million, and total deposits of $224.6 million. Also on November 10, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Cache Holdings, Inc. ( Cache\u201d) of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cache had total assets of $324.6 million, net loans of $308.3 million, and total deposits of $278.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in the December 31, 2017 notes to consolidated financial statements NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.\u201d We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity.\nLoans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of previous charge-offs and an allowance for loan losses, and for purchased loans, net of unamortized purchase premiums and discounts. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans: As a part of previous acquisitions, we acquired certain loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at the acquisition date fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Such purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nNonaccrual Loans: Generally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nImpaired Loans: A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or on the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings: In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan and classified as impaired. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is a troubled debt restructuring remains on nonaccrual until such time that repayment of the remaining principal and interest is not in doubt, and the borrower has a period of satisfactory repayment performance.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A loan review process, independent of the loan approval process, is utilized by management to verify loans are being made and administered in accordance with Company policy, to review loan risk grades and potential losses, to verify that potential problem loans are receiving adequate and timely corrective measures to avoid or reduce losses, and to assist in the verification of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio and class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by us. This actual loss experience is then adjusted by comparing current conditions to the conditions that existed during the loss history. We consider the changes related to (i) lending policies, (ii) economic conditions, (iii) nature and volume of the loan portfolio and class, (iv) lending staff, (v) volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and risk graded loans, (vi) loan review system, (vii) value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, (viii) concentration levels and (ix) effects of other external factors.\nGoodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets.\nCore Deposit Intangibles: Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method. The useful lives of the core deposits are estimated to generally be between seven and ten years.\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles are assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. We have selected December 31 as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\nEmerging Growth Company: Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We have irrevocably elected to adopt new accounting standards within the public company adoption period.\nWe may take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.\nResults of Operations\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses.\nChanges in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and stockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international circumstances and domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets.\nNet Income\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.6 million compared to $9.4 million for year ended December 31, 2016. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million, or 120.3%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, increases in net interest income of $33.4 million and non-interest income of $5.0 million were partially offset by $20.4 million in higher non-interest expenses and an increase of $834 thousand in the provision for loan loss when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of Results of Operations.\u201d\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.4 million compared to $10.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $750 thousand, or 7.4%. During the year ended December 31, 2016, increases in net interest income of $6.3 million, non-interest income of $664 thousand and a reduction of $928 thousand in the provision for loan loss were offset by $8.5 million in higher non-interest expenses when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of Results of Operations.\u201d\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a volume change,\u201d and it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a yield/rate change.\u201d\nThe following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Net Interest Analysis\n\n (1) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans, hedge fair value adjustments and merger fair value adjustments. \n (2) Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets for the period. \n (3) Tax exempt income is not included in the above table on a tax equivalent basis. \n (4) ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. We caution that assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events may, and often do, vary from actual results and the differences can be material. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Also, see the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation includes the following sections:\n \u2022 Overview \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical estimates and assumptions; \n \u2022 Results of Operations - an analysis of our operating results, including disclosures about the sustainability of our earnings; \n \u2022 Financial Condition - an analysis of our financial position; \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of our cash flows and capital position; and \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures - reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. \nOverview\nWe are a bank holding company headquartered in Wichita, Kansas. Our wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Equity Bank, provides a broad range of financial services primarily to businesses and business owners as well as individuals through our network of 42 full service branches located in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. As of December 31, 2017, we had, on a consolidated basis, total assets of $3.17 billion, total deposits of $2.38 billion, total loans held for investment of $2.09 billion (net of allowances) and total stockholders' equity of $374.1 million. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.6 million compared to $9.4 million for the prior year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million, or 120.3%.\nHistory and Background\nSince 2003, we have completed a series of thirteen acquisitions and two charter consolidations. We have sought to integrate the banks we acquire into our existing operational platform and enhance stockholder value through the creation of efficiencies within the combined operations. In conjunction with our strategic acquisition growth, we strive to reposition and improve the loan portfolio and deposit mix of the banks we acquire. Following our acquisitions, we focus on identifying and disposing of problematic loans and replacing them with higher quality loans generated organically. In addition, we have focused on growth in our commercial loan portfolio, which we believe generally offers higher return opportunities than our consumer loan portfolio, primarily by hiring additional talented bankers, particularly in our metropolitan markets, and incentivizing our bankers to expand their commercial banking relationships. We also seek to increase our most attractive deposit accounts primarily by growing deposits in our community markets and cross-selling our depository products to our loan customers.\nOur principal objective is to continue to increase stockholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. We expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe our targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial customer base and increase our current market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which is strategically split between growing metropolitan markets, such as Kansas City, Tulsa and Wichita, and stable community markets within Western Kansas, Western Missouri, Topeka, Northern Arkansas and Northern Oklahoma, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits in community markets that we can use to fund commercial loan growth in our metropolitan markets. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our customers by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based customer service of a community bank.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\n \u2022 Net income allocable to common stockholders of $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million for the previous year ended December 31, 2016, a 120.3% increase. \n \u2022 Total loans held for investment of $2.09 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.38 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $717.6 million, or 52.1%. \n \u2022 Total deposits of $2.38 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $751.6 million, or 46.1%. \n \u2022 Total assets of $3.17 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $2.19 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $978.3 million, or 44.6%. \n \u2022 Book value per common share of $25.62 at December 31, 2017, compared to $22.09 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.53, or 16.0%. \n \u2022 Tangible book value per common share of $17.61 at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.64 at December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.97, or 5.9%. \nWe completed our acquisition of Prairie State Bancshares, Inc. ( Prairie\u201d) of Hoxie, Kansas on March 10, 2017. Prairie had total assets of $153.1 million, net loans of $130.1 million, and total deposits of $125.4 million. On November 10, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Eastman National Bancshares, Inc. ( Eastman\u201d) of Newkirk/Ponca City, Oklahoma. Eastman had total assets of $259.7 million, net loans of $177.9 million, and total deposits of $224.6 million. Also on November 10, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Cache Holdings, Inc. ( Cache\u201d) of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cache had total assets of $324.6 million, net loans of $308.3 million, and total deposits of $278.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. Our accounting policies are described in the December 31, 2017 notes to consolidated financial statements NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.\u201d We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity.\nLoans: Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of previous charge-offs and an allowance for loan losses, and for purchased loans, net of unamortized purchase premiums and discounts. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance.\nPurchased Credit Impaired Loans: As a part of previous acquisitions, we acquired certain loans for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination. These purchased credit impaired loans were recorded at the acquisition date fair value, such that there is no carryover of the seller's allowance for loan losses. After acquisition, losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Such purchased credit impaired loans are accounted for individually. We estimate the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each loan, and the expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid are recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan (accretable yield). The excess of the loan's contractual principal and interest over expected cash flows is not recorded (non-accretable difference). Over the life of the loan, expected cash flows continue to be estimated. If the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying amount, a loss is recorded. If the present value of the expected cash flows is greater than the carrying amount, it is recognized as part of future interest income.\nNonaccrual Loans: Generally, loans are designated as nonaccrual when either principal or interest payments are 90 days or more past due based on contractual terms unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged off no later than 180 days past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed against income. Future interest income may be recorded on a cash basis after recovery of principal is reasonably assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.\nImpaired Loans: A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest due according to the terms of the loan agreement. All loans are individually evaluated for impairment. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or on the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. We evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.\nFactors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings: In cases where a borrower experiences financial difficulties and we make certain concessionary modifications to contractual terms, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan and classified as impaired. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that is a troubled debt restructuring remains on nonaccrual until such time that repayment of the remaining principal and interest is not in doubt, and the borrower has a period of satisfactory repayment performance.\nAllowance for Loan Losses: The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectability of a loan balance is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. A loan review process, independent of the loan approval process, is utilized by management to verify loans are being made and administered in accordance with Company policy, to review loan risk grades and potential losses, to verify that potential problem loans are receiving adequate and timely corrective measures to avoid or reduce losses, and to assist in the verification of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management's judgment, should be charged off.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the collateral. Troubled debt restructurings are separately identified for impairment disclosures and are measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's effective rate at inception. If a troubled debt restructuring is considered to be a collateral dependent loan, the loan is reported, net, at the fair value of the collateral. For troubled debt restructurings that subsequently default, we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the allowance for loan losses.\nThe general component of the allowance for loan losses covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio and class and is based on the actual loss history experienced by us. This actual loss experience is then adjusted by comparing current conditions to the conditions that existed during the loss history. We consider the changes related to (i) lending policies, (ii) economic conditions, (iii) nature and volume of the loan portfolio and class, (iv) lending staff, (v) volume and severity of past due, non-accrual, and risk graded loans, (vi) loan review system, (vii) value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans, (viii) concentration levels and (ix) effects of other external factors.\nGoodwill: Goodwill results from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets.\nCore Deposit Intangibles: Core deposit intangibles are acquired customer relationships arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions. Core deposit intangibles are initially measured at fair value and then are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated method. The useful lives of the core deposits are estimated to generally be between seven and ten years.\nGoodwill and core deposit intangibles are assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment is recognized and expensed in the period identified. We have selected December 31 as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.\nEmerging Growth Company: Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We have irrevocably elected to adopt new accounting standards within the public company adoption period.\nWe may take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as the Company qualifies as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.\nResults of Operations\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest income and fees on loans, interest and dividends on investment securities and non-interest income, such as service charges and fees, debit card income and mortgage banking income. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and non-interest expense, such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses.\nChanges in interest rates earned on interest-earning assets or incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing liabilities and stockholders' equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic change in net interest income. Fluctuations in interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international circumstances and domestic and foreign financial markets. Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, as well as developments affecting the consumer, commercial and real estate sectors within these markets.\nNet Income\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared with year ended December 31, 2016\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $20.6 million compared to $9.4 million for year ended December 31, 2016. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $20.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $11.3 million, or 120.3%. During the year ended December 31, 2017, increases in net interest income of $33.4 million and non-interest income of $5.0 million were partially offset by $20.4 million in higher non-interest expenses and an increase of $834 thousand in the provision for loan loss when compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of Results of Operations.\u201d\nYear ended December 31, 2016 compared with year ended December 31, 2015\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $9.4 million compared to $10.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015. Net income allocable to common stockholders was $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $750 thousand, or 7.4%. During the year ended December 31, 2016, increases in net interest income of $6.3 million, non-interest income of $664 thousand and a reduction of $928 thousand in the provision for loan loss were offset by $8.5 million in higher non-interest expenses when compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The changes in the components of net income are discussed in more detail in the following sections of Results of Operations.\u201d\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin Analysis\nNet interest income is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, including loans and securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits and other borrowed funds. To evaluate net interest income, management measures and monitors (1) yields on loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of deposits and other funding sources, (3) the net interest spread and (4) net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as non-interest-bearing deposits and stockholders' equity also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these non-interest-bearing sources of funds. Net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a volume change,\u201d and it is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowed funds, referred to as a yield/rate change.\u201d\nThe following table shows the average balance of each principal category of assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity and the average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The yields and rates are calculated by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets and Net Interest Analysis\nTable 186:
