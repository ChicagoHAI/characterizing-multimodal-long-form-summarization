We help government and commercial customers to monitor, understand and navigate the changing planet; deliver global broadband communications; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deliver our services with speed, scale and cost effectiveness.\nOur businesses are organized and managed in three reportable segments: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA, as described below under Segment Results.\u201d\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDefinitive Agreement to Sell MDA\nOn December 29, 2019, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( MDA Agreement\u201d), with Neptune Acquisition Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and an affiliate of Northern Private\nCapital Ltd. ( MDA Purchaser\u201d) that provides for, among other things, the MDA Purchaser to purchase MDA, our Canadian subsidiary, from us for an aggregate purchase price of approximately C$1.0 billion ( MDA Transaction\u201d). The MDA Transaction is subject to customary purchase price adjustments for working capital, cash and debt, and as otherwise described below. Pursuant to the MDA Agreement, the MDA Purchaser will acquire all of the outstanding shares in the entities that operate our MDA business.\nThe closing of the MDA Transaction is conditioned on customary closing conditions and on specified regulatory approvals, including review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, Hart-Scott-Rodino review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and Canadian government reviews under the Radiocommunication Act and the Competition Act. The closing of the MDA Transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the Spring or early Summer of 2020.\nThe MDA Agreement contains specified termination rights for us and the MDA Purchaser, including, among others, if the consummation of the MDA Transaction has not occurred by June 29, 2020, subject to extension to September 29, 2020 for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Canada and appealing any injunctions preventing the consummation of the MDA Transaction.\nThe MDA Agreement contains a negative purchase price adjustment of up to C$65 million for a complete loss or failure of RADARSAT-2, such that it cannot be used for its intended commercial purposes.\nThe MDA Agreement provides that the MDA Purchaser will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee of C$55 million under specified circumstances, including, among others, where the MDA Agreement is terminated because (i) the MDA Purchaser has materially breached its representations and warranties or the MDA Purchaser fails to perform its covenants in all material respects, subject to a cure period, or (ii) all of the conditions to closing of the MDA Transaction (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at closing) have been satisfied or waived, we have confirmed in writing to the MDA Purchaser that we stand ready, willing and able to consummate the MDA Transaction and the MDA Purchaser fails to consummate the closing (including for a failure of the MDA Purchaser's debt financing) within two business days of receipt of the notice from us.\nSenior Secured 2023 Notes\nIn December 2019, we issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d) in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2023 Notes were issued at a price of 98%. The 2023 Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments will commence in June 2020. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nThe proceeds from the 2023 Notes and the sale of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our existing senior secured first lien term A facility ( Term Loan A\u201d) and the majority of the outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nConcurrent Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 4, 2019, we further amended our Original Syndicated Credit Facility (the Third Amending Agreement\u201d), certain portions of which became effective immediately and certain portions of which became effective in December 2019 upon the issuance of the 2023 Notes ( Effective Date\u201d). The Third Amending Agreement, during the Covenant Relief Period, (i) modified the priority of the application of certain voluntary prepayments resulting from certain asset sales (but which did not affect the prepayments owed to the Term Loan B), and (ii) restricted use of proceeds of future borrowings. In addition, the Third Amending Agreement increased the maximum consolidated debt leverage ratios permitted under the Original Syndicated Credit Facility to 7.25x at the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, 7.50x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, 7.75x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, 7.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the quarter ending September 30, 2022, 6.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, and 5.75x for each fiscal quarter thereafter (subject to a 0.25x reduction in each maximum level upon a disposition of a\nbusiness line for greater than $500 million). The Third Amending Agreement also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility by two years to December 2023, updated the Interest Coverage Ratio to be less than 2.0x at the end of each fiscal quarter, restricted investment capacity in certain permitted investments, restricted future increases in quarterly dividend payment levels and modified certain margin and standby fee terms. In addition, we canceled the operating credit facility and reduced committed borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.25 billion to $500 million.\nSale Leaseback Agreements\nOn December 10, 2019, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California for proceeds of $291 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of the properties of $136 million, which was adjusted for off-market leaseback terms and is included in Gain on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded operating lease assets and liabilities of $63 million, representing the fair value of the minimum lease payments associated with the agreements to lease assets back over a period of two to ten years; and recognized a deferred financing liability of $33 million for the above-market rent stipulated in the lease agreements which included in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTax Benefit Preservation Plan\nOn May 12, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan ( Tax Plan\u201d), which our Stockholders subsequently approved on October 31, 2019, with the intent to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits ( Tax Benefits\u201d) including those generated by net operating losses. The Tax Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or entity acquiring shares of the Company equal to or exceeding 4.9%. For each common stock outstanding as of May 28, 2019, a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right ( The Rights\u201d) is granted. The Tax Plan gives current stockholders the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a 32 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a set price of $30.92 which, upon exercise, provides for one additional share of common stock at a 50% discount on the exercise date with no cash settlement options. The Rights under the Tax Plan will expire on October 5, 2020. The Tax Plan reduces the likelihood that changes in our investor base have the unintended effect of limiting the use of our Tax Benefits. There is no impact to the financial statements as a result of the Tax Plan.\nSecurity Control Agreement and Facility Clearance and the U.S. Domestication\nOn January 26, 2017, we, together with our U.S.-based subsidiary, Maxar Holdings, and the U.S. Department of Defense entered into a Security Control Agreement ( SCA\u201d) and began operating under the agreement. On February 2, 2018, the Defense Security Service granted facility clearance for our satellite manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California.\nOn January 1, 2019, we completed our previously announced U.S. Domestication. The U.S. Domestication marked a major milestone in our long-term U.S. Access Plan, enhanced our ability to provide and support classified applications for U.S. government agencies and fulfilled a commitment made in acquiring DigitalGlobe. On January 8, 2020, the SCA was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense, who determined that the SCA was no longer necessary as a result of the U.S. Domestication. The SCA was replaced by a simple Board Resolution that will continue to govern our foreign ownership and controlling interests.\nKey Leadership Changes\nOn January 14, 2019, we announced the appointment of Daniel Jablonsky as President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky, who most recently served as President of DigitalGlobe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxar, also joined the Maxar Board of Directors. He succeeds Howard Lance, who resigned from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of Maxar.\nIn December 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors elected retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Howell M. Estes III as Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2019, coincident with the U.S. Domestication. Gen. Estes, who has served as a director of our Board of Directors since the acquisition of DigitalGlobe, succeeds Robert L. Phillips, who will continue to serve as a director.\nIn July 2018, we announced the appointment of Biggs Porter as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Maxar, effective August 15, 2018. Anil Wirasekara, who previously served as Chief Financial Officer from 1994 to October 2017, assumed the duties of Interim Chief Financial Officer after William McCombe stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in February 2018.\nWorldView-4 Satellite\nDuring December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery. As a result, during December 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $162 million for the remaining book value of the satellite, related assets and future premium payments. On May 3, 2019, we announced that our insurance carriers accepted our $183 million claim for loss arising from the WorldView-4 satellite on orbit failure and agreed to pay us the full amount. As of December 31, 2019, we have collected the full insurance proceeds.\nAcquisition of DigitalGlobe\nOn October 5, 2017, we completed the DigitalGlobe Transaction and renamed the combined company Maxar Technologies Ltd. The transaction created a global leader in Earth imaging and geospatial solutions by combining DigitalGlobe's over 15-year lead in technology and ImageLibrary development, as well as its high-resolution Earth imaging capabilities, with our existing position as a world leader in commercial communications satellites.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to grow in the U.S. and global Earth observation and geospatial services markets through our end-to-end space systems, Earth imagery and geospatial solutions. As a result of the DigitalGlobe Transaction, we increased our scale and we believe, credibility with U.S. government agencies and international government customers. The DigitalGlobe Transaction also added more predictable geospatial data and services revenue while diversifying our product and service offering. With a larger set of customers and end markets, we are better able to increase share in existing markets and grow in adjacent markets.\nOur vision is to be the world's leader in the new space economy. We aim to achieve this by integrating innovative technologies, unique capabilities and end-to-end offerings across our businesses to help our customers address their most complex mission-critical challenges with confidence.\nSegment Results\nIn January 2019, with the appointment of Mr. Jablonsky as our President and Chief Executive Officer, our CODM changed. During the fourth quarter of 2019, following a number of changes, the CODM changed the way in which he assesses performance and allocates resources. As a result, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect how the CODM currently reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. Our CODM measures performance of our reportable segments based on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our operating and reportable segments are: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA. With our announcement of the MDA Transaction on December 30, 2019, the MDA segment has been classified within Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reportable segment change.\nEarth Intelligence\nIn the Earth Intelligence segment, we are a global leader in high resolution space-based optical and radar imagery products and analytics. We launched the world's first high resolution commercial imaging satellite in 1999 and currently operate a four-satellite imaging constellation, providing us with a 110 petabyte historical ImageLibrary of the highest-resolution, commercially available imagery. Our imagery solutions provide customers with timely, accurate and mission-critical information about our changing planet and support a wide variety of government and commercial applications, including mission planning, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, disaster management, crop management, oil and gas exploration and infrastructure management. Our principal customers in the Earth Intelligence segment are U.S. and other international government agencies (primarily defense and intelligence agencies), as well as a\nwide variety of commercial customers in multiple markets. We are a market leader in the commercial satellite Earth observation industry.\nWe also provide geospatial services that combine imagery, analytic expertise and innovative technology to deliver intelligence solutions to customers. Our cleared developers, analysts, and data scientists provide analytic solutions that accurately document change and enable geospatial modeling and analysis that help predict where events will occur. Our primary customer of geospatial services is the U.S. government, but we also support intelligence requirements for other U.S. allied governments, global development organizations and commercial customers.\nThe Earth Intelligence segment includes the financial results of the legacy Imagery and Services segments, excluding the legacy Canadian radar imagery business.\nSpace Infrastructure\nIn the Space Infrastructure segment, we are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure. We design, build, integrate and test solutions for space-based communications satellites, on-orbit servicing, robotic assembly and space exploration. We address a broad spectrum of needs for our customers, including mission systems engineering, product design, spacecraft manufacturing, assembly integration and testing. We provide advanced, reliable, and affordable spacecraft that enable our commercial customers to deliver valuable global services, and we are successfully partnering with the U.S. government in new space opportunities. Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide.\nThe Space Infrastructure segment includes the financial results of our legacy Space Solutions business (previously referred to as Space Systems/Loral LLC or SSL) which was previously included within our legacy Space Systems segment.\nMDA\nIn the MDA segment, we are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure in Canada. We develop and deliver advanced surveillance and intelligence solutions, defense and maritime systems, radar geospatial imagery, space robotics, satellite antennas and communication subsystems. The MDA segment includes the financial results of the MDA and legacy radar imagery business. We have a long history in space robotics, having developed the Canadarms for NASA's Space Shuttle program and Canadarm2, which is currently in service on the International Space Station. Our principal customers in the MDA segment are the Canadian government and other government and commercial customers worldwide. As discussed above, in connection with the MDA Transaction, the financial results from this segment were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides selected annual financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Revenues on satellite contracts are recognized using the cost-to-cost method to determine the percentage of completion over the construction period, which typically ranges between 20 to 36 months and up to 48 months in special situations. Adjusted EBITDA margins can vary from quarter to quarter due to the mix of our revenues and changes in our estimated costs to complete as our risks are retired and as our estimated costs to complete are increased or decreased based on contract performance.\nRevenues from the Space Infrastructure segment decreased to $706 million from $823 million, or by $117 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Revenues decreased primarily as a result of the impact of reduced volume in our GeoComm business and an increase in estimated costs to complete programs. The reduced volume was a result of new business not fully replacing existing backlog contracts that were completed during the period.\nRevenues from the Space Infrastructure segment decreased to $823 million from $932 million, or by $109 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Revenues decreased primarily as a result of the impact of reduced volume in our GeoComm business, an increase in estimated costs to complete programs and $28 million of liquidated damages which were recorded during 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA from the Space Infrastructure segment was a loss of $17 million compared to a loss of $75 million, or an increase of $58 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily related to reduced research and development spend of $72 million and headcount reductions from restructuring initiatives resulting in lower costs and the impact of no new liquidated damages being incurred compared to $28 million of liquidated damages in 2018. These increases were partially offset by decreases from the effects of lower revenues and higher estimated costs to complete on certain projects along with losses incurred on developmental builds.\nAdjusted EBITDA from the Space Infrastructure segment was a loss of $75 million compared to a loss of $59 million, or a change of $16 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease from 2017 to 2018 is primarily related to an increase in estimated costs to complete programs as a result of supplier performance issues and delays experienced during the second half of 2018, as well as unanticipated impacts of lower volume, which resulted in lower productivity and overhead absorption. In addition, we incurred $28 million of liquidated damages in 2018, compared to a recovery of liquidated damages during 2017 and research and development expenses were $13 million higher in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. In 2017, Adjusted EBITDA included a credit of $26 million relating to the curtailment of a postretirement benefit plan which did not reoccur in 2018.\nCorporate and other expenses\nCorporate and other expenses include items such as corporate office costs, regulatory costs, executive and director compensation, foreign exchange gains and losses, retention costs, and fees for legal and consulting services.\nCorporate and other expenses increased to $86 million from $49 million, or by $37 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in retention costs related to the Space Infrastructure segment of $24 million and an increase as a result of a shift of certain functions to corporate and other increases in selling, general and administrative expense of approximately $12 million.\nCorporate and other expenses increased to $49 million from $8 million, or by $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily driven by additional headcount as a result of the DigitalGlobe Transaction, and the expansion and ramp up of corporate functions to support our increased scale.\nIntersegment eliminations\nIntersegment eliminations are related to projects between our segments, primarily WV-Legion. Intersegment eliminations have increased for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 compared to the same period of 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily related to an increase in satellite construction activity.\nBACKLOG\nOur backlog by segment from continuing operations is as follows:\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earth Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,433\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Space Infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 651\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,631\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,084\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unfunded contract options\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,213\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,297\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrder backlog, representing the estimated dollar value of firm funded contracts for which work has not been performed (also known as the remaining performance obligations on a contract), decreased to $1.6 billion from $2.1 billion, or by approximately $500 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. Order backlog generally does not include unexercised contract options and potential orders under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Approximately 61% of the total $1.6 billion backlog as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be converted into revenue in 2020.\nBacklog in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily comprised of multi-year awards, such as satellite builds. Fluctuations in the backlog are driven primarily by the timing of large program wins. Most of the Earth Intelligence segment contracts are annual contracts, which renew at various times throughout the year. As a result, the timing of when contracts are awarded and when option years are exercised may cause backlog to fluctuate significantly from\nperiod to period. The decrease in backlog within the Earth Intelligence segment is primarily driven by the timing of the exercise of the EnhancedView Contract option year and a decrease due to the termination of a contract related to the loss of WorldView-4. These decreases were partially offset by increases in geospatial services.\nUnfunded contract options represent estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from negotiated contracts with unexercised contract options and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts. Unfunded contract options as of December 31, 2019 were primarily comprised of the option years in the EnhancedView Contract (September 1, 2020 through August 31, 2023). We believe it is the U.S. government's intention to exercise all option years, subject only to annual congressional appropriation of funding and the federal budget process. As each option year is exercised, it will be added to backlog.\nAlthough backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm, terminations, amendments or cancellations may occur, which could result in a reduction in our total backlog.\nLIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur sources of liquidity include cash provided by operations, collection or securitization of orbital receivables, access to existing credit facilities and, when available and efficient, to the capital markets. We generally maintain limited cash on hand and use available cash to pay down borrowings on our Syndicated Credit Facility. Our primary short-term cash requirements are to fund working capital, including requirements on long-term construction contracts (including our geostationary satellite contracts), fixed overhead costs, and to fund increased capital expenditures, including the construction of our WV-Legion constellation. Working capital requirements can vary significantly from period to period, particularly as a result of the timing of receipts and disbursements related to long-term construction contracts. Our medium-term to long-term cash requirements are to service and repay debt and to invest, including in facilities, equipment, technologies, and research and development for growth initiatives. These capital investments include investments to replace the capability or capacity of satellites which have or will go out of service in the future. Over the near-term to medium-term, it is also possible that our customers may fully or partially fund the construction of additional Legion satellites. We also have call options to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Vricon Inc., a joint venture accounted for under the equity method. The call options are exercisable beginning in the first quarter of either 2020 or 2021 which, if exercised, would require the use of capital. The call option is $150 million to $200 million, including assumed liabilities, but may vary based on future results. Cash is also used to pay dividends and finance other long-term strategic business initiatives. Our first maturity of long-term debt is in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur ability to fund these needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate cash in the future, which depends on our future financial results. Our future results are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our control. Our future access to, and the availability of credit on acceptable terms and conditions is impacted by many factors, including capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions.\nWe intend to use the net cash proceeds from the MDA Transaction to pay down the Company's long-term debt. The net cash proceeds will be determined under the Company's Original Syndicated Credit Facility, the 2023 Notes and the MDA Agreement. These proceeds include the netting of certain fees and liabilities, which include the indemnification of the MDA Purchaser for certain liabilities including a dispute with the Ukrainian customer.\nWe believe that our cash from operating activities generated from continuing operations during the year, together with available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be adequate for the next twelve months to meet our anticipated uses of cash flow, including working capital, capital expenditure, debt service costs, dividend, and other commitments. While we intend to reduce debt over time using cash provided by operations and net proceeds from the MDA Transaction, we may also seek to meet long-term debt obligations, if necessary, by obtaining capital from a variety of additional sources or by refinancing existing obligations. These sources include public or private capital markets, bank financings, proceeds from dispositions or other third-party sources. Following the sale of MDA, we will continue to evaluate if there are additional assets to be monetized.\nSummary of cash flows\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 56\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (129)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,332)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities - discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (150)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,341)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (208)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,257\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in provided by financing activities - discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (238)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,235\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nCash provided by operating activities related to continuing operations increased to $258 million from $114 million, or by $144 million, in the year ended December 31, 2019 from the corresponding period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to net income in 2019, compared to a net loss in 2018, adjusted for non-cash items and insurance proceeds of $183 million related to the loss of the WorldView-4 satellite. The insurance proceeds are included in operating cash flows as they are considered business interruption recovery and represent our satellite's loss of capacity to produce imagery for sale to our customers.\nCash provided by operating activities related to discontinued operations increased to $59 million from $25 million, or by $34 million, in the year ended December 31, 2019 from the corresponding period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital in 2019 compared to 2018 and net income in 2019, compared to a loss in 2018, adjusted for non-cash items.\nCash provided by operating activities related to continuing operations increased to $114 million from $56 million, or by $58 million, in the year ended December 31, 2018 from the corresponding period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of DigitalGlobe's operating results, partially offset by a decrease in contract liabilities due to revenue recognized.\nCash provided by operating activities related to discontinued operations decreased to $25 million from $49 million, or by $24 million, in the year ended December 31, 2018 from the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by net losses of $377 million during the period ended December 31, 2018, which included $477 million of impairment losses.\nCash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period as a result of our working capital requirements, given our portfolio of large construction programs and the timing of milestone receipts and payments with customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business. Investment in working capital is also necessary to build our business and manage lead times in construction activities. We expect working capital account balances to continue to vary from period to period. We efficiently fund our working capital requirements with the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below).\nInvesting activities\nCash used in investing activities related to continuing operations decreased to $6 million from $129 million, or by $123 million, in the year ended December 31, 2019 from the corresponding period in 2018. The primary investing activities included expenditures on property, plant and equipment of $257 million and $150 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and investments in software of $57 million and $56 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Property, plant and equipment expenditures in 2019 and 2018 primarily related to the build of our Legion satellite constellation. In 2019, these expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds of $280 million from the sale and subsequent leaseback of our properties in Palo Alto, California. In 2018, expenditures were partially offset by net proceeds of $68 million from the sale of one of our buildings in Palo Alto, California. Cash used in investing activities in 2019 was also partially offset by a return of capital from discontinued operations of $28 million.\nCash used in investing activities related to discontinued operations decreased to $7 million from $21 million, or by $14 million, in the year ended December 31, 2019 from the corresponding period in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash investments in property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and the acquisition of Neptec Design Group Ltd. ( Neptec\u201d) in 2018.\nCash used in investing activities from continuing operations decreased to $129 million from $2,332 million, or by $2,203 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 from the corresponding period in 2017. Property, plant and equipment expenditures in 2018 of $206 million were primarily related to the build of our Legion satellite constellation and were partially offset by net proceeds of $68 million from the sale of one of our buildings in Palo Alto, California. The primary investing activity in 2017 was the acquisition of DigitalGlobe.\nCash used in investing activities related to discontinued operations increased to $21 million from $9 million, or by $12 million, in the year ended December 31, 2018 from the corresponding period in 2017. The primary investing activity in 2018 was the acquisition of Neptec for $6 million. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment were approximately $6 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Purchases of intangible assets were $6 million and $7 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nFinancing activities\nCash used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2019 increased to $208 million versus cash provided by financing activities of $15 million in 2018, or by $223 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities from continuing operations included net proceeds from bank borrowings of $980 million offset by debt repayments of $1,115 million, debt issuance costs and fees paid to creditors of $24 million, repurchases of orbital receivables of $24 million and settlement of securitization liability of $20 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations included proceeds from bank borrowings of $104 million, proceeds from securitization of orbital receivables of $18 million and was offset by debt repayments of $27 million, settlement of securitization liability of $15 million and dividend payments of $65 million.\nCash used in financing activities related to discontinued operations increased to $30 million from $2 million, or by $28 million, in the year ended December 31, 2019 from the corresponding period in 2018. The increase was primarily due to a return of capital from discontinued operations to continuing operations of $28 million in 2019.\nCash provided by financing activities from continuing operations decreased to $15 million from $2,257 million, or by $2,242 million, in the year ended December 31, 2018 from the corresponding period in 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations included net proceeds from bank borrowings of $104 million, proceeds from securitization of orbital receivables of $18 million, debt repayment of $27 million, settlement of securitization liability of $15 million, and dividend payments of $65 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by financing activities included proceeds from the Syndicated Credit Facility (as defined below) of $3,160 million, debt repayment of $779 million, payment of debt issuance costs of $63 million, settlement of securitization liability of $15 million and dividend payments of $47 million.\nCash used in financing activities related to discontinued operations decreased to $2 million from $22 million, or by $20 million, in the year ended December 31, 2018 from the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to $19 million in overdraft during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nLong-term debt\nThe following table summarizes our long-term debt:\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Syndicated Credit Facility:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 595\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,980\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt discount and issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Obligations under finance leases and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 2,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,043\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSyndicated Credit Facility\nAs of December 31, 2019, the senior secured syndicated credit facility (the Original Syndicated Credit Facility\u201d, as amended prior to December 31, 2019, including as described below, the Syndicated Credit Facility\u201d) is composed of: (i) a senior secured first lien revolving credit facility maturing in December 2023 (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and (ii) a senior secured first lien term B facility maturing in October 2024 (the Term Loan B\u201d).\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) U.S. dollar LIBOR, plus a margin of 120 - 425 basis points per annum, based on our total leverage ratio or (ii) adjusted base rate, plus a margin of 20-325 basis points per annum, based on the Company's total leverage ratio. The Term Loan B bears interest at our option, either (i) U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 275 basis points per annum, or (ii) adjusted base rate, plus a margin of 175 basis points per annum. In April 2018, we entered into interest rate swaps at a notional value of $1.0 billion maturing in April 2021 or April 2022. As of December 31, 2019, we had hedged approximately 51% of our floating rate exposure on our outstanding debt at an average base rate of 2.56% (excluding the margin specified in the Syndicated Credit Facility).\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is payable at maturity. The Term Loan B will amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan B, with the final balance payable at maturity. The Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B may be repaid by us, in whole or in part, together with accrued interest, without premium or penalty.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility is guaranteed by us and certain of our designated subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors\u201d). The security for the Syndicated Credit Facility, subject to customary exceptions, includes substantially all our tangible and intangible assets and our Subsidiary Guarantors. We are required to make mandatory prepayments of the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Syndicated Credit Facility (i) upon the occurrence of certain events and (ii) to the extent of a specified percentage of annual excess cash flow that is not reinvested or used for other specified purposes. The Syndicated Credit Facility is subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, default provisions, representations and warranties and other terms and conditions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility includes an aggregate $200 million sub limit under which letters of credit can be issued. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had $18 million of issued and undrawn letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nSenior Secured Notes due 2023\nIn December 2019, we issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d) in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2023 Notes were issued at a price of 98% and are recorded as long-term debt in our consolidated financial statements. The 2023 Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments will commence in June 2020.\nThe 2023 Notes are guaranteed ( Guarantees\u201d) on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantees the Syndicated Credit Facility ( Guarantors\u201d). The 2023 Notes are secured, equally and ratably with the Syndicated Credit Facility and any future first lien debt, by liens on the same assets that secure the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan B.\nThe 2023 Notes and the Guarantees are our general senior secured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our and the Guarantors' existing and future unsubordinated debt (including the Syndicated Credit Facility). The 2023 Notes and the Guarantees are effectively senior to all of our and the Guarantors' existing and future unsecured debt as well as to all of any permitted junior lien debt that may be incurred in the future, in each case to the extent of the value of the assets securing the 2023 Notes and the Guarantees. The 2023 Notes and the Guarantees are effectively subordinated to any obligations that are secured by liens on assets that do not constitute a part of the collateral securing the 2023 Notes or the Guarantees, are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2023 Notes, and are senior in right of payment to all of our and the Guarantors' existing and future subordinated indebtedness.\nThe indenture governing the 2023 Notes limits, among other things, our and our restricted subsidiaries' ability to: incur, assume or guarantee additional debt; issue redeemable stock and preferred stock; pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase subordinated debt; make loans and investments; grant or incur liens; restrict dividends, loans or asset transfers from restricted subsidiaries; sell or otherwise dispose of assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; reduce our satellite insurance; and consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person. The 2023 Notes are also subject to compliance with a financial maintenance covenant in respect of our Consolidated Total Debt Ratio which is 7.25x at the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, 7.50x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, 7.75x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, 7.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the quarter ending September 30, 2022, 6.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, and 5.75x for each fiscal quarter thereafter (subject to a 0.25x reduction in each maximum level upon a disposition of a business line for greater than $500 million).\nThe 2023 Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at any time during the 12 months beginning on December 15, 2021 at a redemption price of 107.313%, during the 12 months beginning on December 15, 2022 at a redemption price of 103.656%, and at any time on or after December 15, 2023 at a redemption price of 100%, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon to the redemption date. We may also redeem the 2023 Notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any time prior to December 15, 2021 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2023 Notes plus a make-whole\u201d premium, together with accrued but unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes at any time before December 15, 2021 with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a specified redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nIn the event a change of control occurs (as defined in the indenture governing the 2023 Notes), each holder will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any part of such holder's 2023 Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2023 Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).\nLeaseback Deferred Financing\nIn December 2019, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California for proceeds of $291 million. We determined that the leaseback terms were off-market. In accordance with ASC 842 - Leases, we accounted for the excess of the leaseback payments over the present value of market rental payments as additional financing, separate from the lease liability. This resulted in recognition of deferred financing liability of $33 million which is repayable over the 10-year leaseback term.\nSecuritization liability\nWe have in place a revolving securitization facility agreement with an international financial institution. Under the terms of the Syndicated Credit Facility, we may offer to sell eligible orbital receivables from time to time with terms of seven years or less, discounted to face value using prevailing market rates. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not sell any eligible receivables and repurchased $24 million of specifically identified orbital receivables. The orbital receivables were repurchased as a result of our customer transferring the obligation to another entity which did not meet the credit criteria of our lenders. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company sold orbital receivables for net proceeds of $18 million and did not repurchase any receivables. These sold orbital receivables were purchased in tranches that span multiple years and include longer-term maturities.\nThe orbital receivables that were securitized remain on our balance sheet as the accounting criteria for surrendering control of the orbital receivables were not met. The net proceeds received have been recognized as a securitization liability that has been subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The securitized orbital receivables and the securitization liabilities are being drawn down as payments are received from customers and passed on to the purchaser of the tranche. We continue to recognize orbital interest revenue on the orbital receivables that are subject to the securitization transactions and recognize interest expense to accrete the securitization liability.\nCash requirements related to interest costs, income taxes, and pensions and other postretirement obligations\nRefer to Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for cash payments for interest costs and income taxes, and Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk\u201d for discussion of potential impacts of fluctuations in interest rates.\nFunding of pension plans\nFunding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our U.S. pension plan. Failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds with respect to appropriate laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plans or make benefit payments. With respect to our U.S. qualified pension plan, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds. The total estimated contributions expected to be paid to the plan for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $20 million.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe enter into contractual obligations in the normal course of business. The following table provides a summary of our payment obligations for continuing operations in each of the next five years and thereafter specifically related to long-term debt, operating leases and other obligations.\nTable 86: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Syndicated credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,960\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2023 Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securitization liability (excluding interest)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred financing and other long-term obligations1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 3,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 139\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Deferred financing relates to the sale leaseback.\nWe have significant purchase obligations for goods and services, under agreements with defined terms as to quantity, price and timing of delivery. Most of these conditional purchase obligations are for purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, operational commitments related to remote ground terminals, or with subcontractors on long-term construction contracts that we have with customers.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our banks issued letters of credit for $23 million and $52 million, respectively, in the normal course of business.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business as either a plaintiff or defendant. We analyze all legal proceedings and the allegations therein. The outcome of any of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Refer to Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of legal proceedings.\nFor further information on our contractual obligations, contingencies and commitments, see Note 23, Commitments and contingencies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had foreign exchange sales contracts of $9 million and letters of credit guaranteed by export credit agencies and the Senior Credit Facility, while indemnified by us. Such arrangements are not expected to have a material effect on our liquidity or capital resources, financial position or results of operations.\nWe use derivative financial instruments to manage existing foreign currency exposures. We consider the management of financial risks to be an important part of our overall corporate risk management policy. Foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge our exposure to currency risk on sales, purchases, cash, net investments and loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our domestic and foreign operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial\nstatements requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because these policies require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nThe recognition and measurement of revenue requires the use of judgments and estimates. Specifically, judgment is used in interpreting complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions and determining when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met.\nSpace Infrastructure\nRevenue in the Space Infrastructure segment is primarily generated from long-term construction contracts. Due to the long-term nature of these contracts, we generally recognize revenue over time using the cost-to-cost method to measure progress. Under the cost-to-cost method, revenue is recognized based on the proportion of total costs incurred to estimated total costs-at-completion (\"EAC\"). An EAC includes all direct costs and indirect costs directly attributable to a program or allocable based on our program cost pooling arrangements. Estimates regarding the Company's cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of products and services are used in determining the EAC. Changes to an EAC are recorded as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.\nOur cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge of our engineering, program management and financial professionals and draws on their significant experience and judgment. We prepare EAC's for our contracts and calculate estimated revenues and costs over the life of our contracts. Since our contracts typically span a period of several years, estimation of revenue, cost, and progress toward completion requires the use of judgment. Judgements and estimates are re-assessed at least quarterly with most estimates being updated on a monthly basis. Adjustments in estimates could have a material impact on revenue recognition based on the significance of the adjustments. Factors considered in these estimates include our historical performance, the availability, productivity and cost of labor, the nature and complexity of work to be performed, availability and cost of materials, components and subcontracts, the risk and impact of delayed performance and the level of indirect cost allocations.\nEarth Intelligence\nRevenue in the Earth Intelligence segment is generated from imagery and geospatial intelligence service contracts. Revenue from imagery service contracts is recognized based on satellite capacity made available to the customer in a particular period, when imagery is delivered to the customer, or ratably over the subscription period. Many of our imagery service contracts relate to the transfer of a series of distinct goods or services over time for which management has determined are a single performance obligation. Revenue from our geospatial intelligence service contracts is recognized from the rendering of services that compensate us at a cost-plus-fixed-fee, firm fixed price, or on a time and materials basis.\nSome of our contracts contain multiple performance obligations, which requires us to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation in order to allocate consideration transferred from the customer. We have not historically been able to use third-party evidence for determining standalone selling price due to the unique nature of our products and services and lack of visibility into competitor pricing. Standalone selling prices are determined based on management estimates that involve significant judgment. Multiple factors are considered based on the nature of the deliverables included within the contract, which include market conditions, competitive landscape, geographic or regional specific factors, internal costs, profit margin objectives and pricing practices used by us.\nPension benefits\nThe determination of projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and pension expense requires the use of estimates and actuarial assumptions. We perform an annual review of our estimates and actuarial assumptions in consultation with our actuaries and investment advisors. We believe that the accounting estimates related to our pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations and market conditions. The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends performed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.\nThe principal estimates and assumptions used in the measurement and recording of our pension benefit plans that have a significant effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements are the discount rate and expected return on plan assets.\nDiscount rates for the U.S. Space Infrastructure pension plans are calculated by actuaries using the Standard FTSE Pension Discount Curve. A singular discount rate is then determined, such that the resulting liability from discounting using the curve matches the liability resulting from discounting the same cash flows using the aforementioned singular discount rate.\nThe expected return on plan assets is based on our best estimate and input from plan investment advisors and actuaries. The rate is representative of a long-term expected return based on asset mix returns utilizing a 30-year annualized geometric return of net fees.\nFor further information regarding our pension benefit plans see Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies\u201d and Note 19, Employee benefit plans\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d.\nGoodwill\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment as of October 1, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired. We identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nBased on the results of our quantitative assessment performed as of October 1, 2019, the estimated fair value of the MDA reporting unit was significantly in excess of its carrying value. This analysis was updated upon announcement of the MDA Transaction for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company concluded that there were no impairment indicators related to goodwill at either of the dates the impairment analyses were performed.\nThe estimated fair value of the Earth Intelligence reporting unit slightly exceeded its carrying value. We performed a sensitivity analysis over key valuation assumptions. Due to the level of fair value exceeding carrying value and the results of the sensitivity analysis, we may need to record an impairment charge in the future if the operating results of Earth Intelligence are significantly lower than our strategic growth plan assumptions.\nThe Space Infrastructure reporting unit does not have any goodwill. Its estimated fair value was only used in evaluating the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to market data.\nWhen evaluating goodwill for impairment, we typically estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using an income approach. To assess the reasonableness of our results, we reconcile the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units, including our Corporate balance sheet, to the Company's market capitalization and market value of invested capital as of the date of our annual impairment test. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, which requires the use of significant judgments and estimates, including future cash flows, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. The projections for future cash flows are generated using our strategic growth plan and include\nassumptions about future revenue growth, operating margins, capital expenditures, income tax rates, and working capital requirements. The terminal growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our discounted cash flow analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. The risk premium is a subjective adjustment that, by its very nature does not include market related data, but instead examines the prospects of the reporting unit relative to the broader industry to determine if there are specific factors, which may make it more risky\u201d relative to the industry.\nThe discounted cash flow approach requires management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed. Actual results could differ from these assumptions. Management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering current economic conditions.\nAdditional risks for goodwill across all reporting units include, but are not limited to, the risks discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and:\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value of our reporting units; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our failure to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted value of our reporting units; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>adverse technological events that could impact our performance; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>significant adverse changes in the regulatory environment or markets in which we operate. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result from these factors. We will continue to monitor our goodwill for potential impairment indicators in future periods.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying amount of long-lived tangible and intangible assets to be held and used in the business for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances warrant such a review. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to: a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset (or asset group) is used; a significant adverse change in the operations of our satellites; a change in government spending or customer demand that could affect the value of the asset group; a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset group; or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset group.\nThere were no impairments of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States, Canada, and other foreign jurisdictions. We compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which they are expected to be paid for or realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Significant judgments are required in order to determine the realizability of tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, estimates of future sources of taxable income, carry-forward periods available, the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and other relevant factors.\nThe recognition of uncertain tax positions is evaluated based on whether it is considered more likely than not that position taken, or expected to be taken, on a tax return will be sustained upon examination through litigation or appeal. For those positions that meet the recognition criteria, they are measured as the largest amount that is more than 50\npercent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We believe that the reserves for unrecognized tax benefits are adequate to cover all open tax years based on our assessment. If the expected outcome of the matter changes, we will adjust income tax expense accordingly in the period in which the expected outcome has changed. We classify interest and penalties related to income taxes as income tax expense.\nWe earn investment and other tax credits with respect to research and development expenses. The benefit of these tax credits is recorded as a reduction of income tax expense.\nOn December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted into law, which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, lowered the U.S. statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, modified existing interest limitation regulations and created new provisions for the base erosion and anti-abuse tax and global intangible low-taxed income inclusion that taxes certain payments between U.S. corporations and their foreign subsidiaries. During 2019, additional proposed and final regulations were released to clarify the provisions modified or created within the 2017 Tax Act. The effects of the final regulations and any proposed regulations that are anticipated to be enacted substantially in similar form were included in our annual results.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3, New standards and interpretations not yet adopted\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental indicators of our financial and operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe define EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for certain items affecting comparability as specified in the calculation. Certain items affecting comparability include restructuring, impairments, satellite insurance recovery, gain on sale of assets, CEO severance and transaction and integration related expense. Transaction and integration related expense includes costs associated with de-leveraging activities, acquisitions and dispositions and the integration of acquisitions. Management believes that exclusion of these items assists in providing a more complete understanding of our underlying results and trends, and management uses these measures along with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures to manage our business, evaluate our performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure being used as a key element of our incentive compensation plan. The Syndicated Credit Facility also uses Adjusted EBITDA in the determination of our debt leverage covenant ratio. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA in the Syndicated Credit Facility includes a more comprehensive set of adjustments.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results, provide useful information to investors by facilitating the comparability of our ongoing operating results over the periods presented, the ability to identify trends in our underlying business, and the comparison of our operating results against analyst financial models and operating results of other public companies.\nThe table below reconciles our net (loss) income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (1,250)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 60\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (168)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 219\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 376\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (659)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 141\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (116)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction and integration related expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment losses, including inventory\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Satellite insurance recovery\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (183)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (136)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (33)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CEO severance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 85\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earth Intelligence\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Space Infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (86)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 85\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "This report provides an overview of the financial condition and results of operations for a company that focuses on Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure.

provider of solutions in Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure. We help government and commercial customers to monitor, understand and navigate the changing planet; deliver global broadband communications; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deliver our services with speed, scale and cost effectiveness.\nOur businesses are organized and managed in three reportable segments: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA, as described below under Segment Results.\u201d\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDefinitive Agreement to Sell MDA\nOn December 29, 2019, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( MDA Agreement\u201d), with Neptune Acquisition Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and an affiliate of Northern Private\nCapital Ltd. ( MDA Purchaser\u201d) that provides for, among other things, the MDA Purchaser to purchase MDA, our Canadian subsidiary, from us for an aggregate purchase price of approximately C$1.0 billion ( MDA Transaction\u201d). The MDA Transaction is subject to customary purchase price adjustments for working capital, cash and debt, and as otherwise described below. Pursuant to the MDA Agreement, the MDA Purchaser will acquire all of the outstanding shares in the entities that operate our MDA business.\nThe closing of the MDA Transaction is conditioned on customary closing conditions and on specified regulatory approvals, including review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, Hart-Scott-Rodino review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and Canadian government reviews under the Radiocommunication Act and the Competition Act. The closing of the MDA Transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the Spring or early Summer of 2020.\nThe MDA Agreement contains specified termination rights for us and the MDA Purchaser, including, among others, if the consummation of the MDA Transaction has not occurred by June 29, 2020, subject to extension to September 29, 2020 for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Canada and appealing any injunctions preventing the consummation of the MDA Transaction.\nThe MDA Agreement contains a negative purchase price adjustment of up to C$65 million for a complete loss or failure of RADARSAT-2, such that it cannot be used for its intended commercial purposes.\nThe MDA Agreement provides that the MDA Purchaser will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee of C$55 million under specified circumstances, including, among others, where the MDA Agreement is terminated because (i) the MDA Purchaser has materially breached its representations and warranties or the MDA Purchaser fails to perform its covenants in all material respects, subject to a cure period, or (ii) all of the conditions to closing of the MDA Transaction (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at closing) have been satisfied or waived, we have confirmed in writing to the MDA Purchaser that we stand ready, willing and able to consummate the MDA Transaction and the MDA Purchaser fails to consummate the closing (including for a failure of the MDA Purchaser's debt financing) within two business days of receipt of the notice from us.\nSenior Secured 2023 Notes\nIn December 2019, we issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d) in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2023 Notes were issued at a price of 98%. The 2023 Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments will commence in June 2020. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nThe proceeds from the 2023 Notes and the sale of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our existing senior secured first lien term A facility ( Term Loan A\u201d) and the majority of the outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nConcurrent Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 4, 2019, we further amended our Original Syndicated Credit Facility (the Third Amending Agreement\u201d), certain portions of which became effective immediately and certain portions of which became effective in December 2019 upon the issuance of the 2023 Notes ( Effective Date\u201d). The Third Amending Agreement, during the Covenant Relief Period, (i) modified the priority of the application of certain voluntary prepayments resulting from certain asset sales (but which did not affect the prepayments owed to the Term Loan B), and (ii) restricted use of proceeds of future borrowings. In addition, the Third Amending Agreement increased the maximum consolidated debt leverage ratios permitted under the Original Syndicated Credit Facility to 7.25x at the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, 7.50x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, 7.75x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, 7.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the quarter ending September 30, 2022, 6.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, and 5.75x for each fiscal quarter thereafter (subject to a 0.25x reduction in each maximum level upon a disposition of a\nbusiness line for greater than $500 million). The Third Amending Agreement also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility by two years to December 2023, updated the Interest Coverage Ratio to be less than 2.0x at the end of each fiscal quarter, restricted investment capacity in certain permitted investments, restricted future increases in quarterly dividend payment levels and modified certain margin and standby fee terms. In addition, we canceled the operating credit facility and reduced committed borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.25 billion to $500 million.\nSale Leaseback Agreements\nOn December 10, 2019, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California for proceeds of $291 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of the properties of $136 million, which was adjusted for off-market leaseback terms and is included in Gain on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded operating lease assets and liabilities of $63 million, representing the fair value of the minimum lease payments associated with the agreements to lease assets back over a period of two to ten years; and recognized a deferred financing liability of $33 million for the above-market rent stipulated in the lease agreements which included in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTax Benefit Preservation Plan\nOn May 12, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan ( Tax Plan\u201d), which our Stockholders subsequently approved on October 31, 2019, with the intent to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits ( Tax Benefits\u201d) including those generated by net operating losses. The Tax Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or entity acquiring shares of the Company equal to or exceeding 4.9%. For each common stock outstanding as of May 28, 2019, a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right ( The Rights\u201d) is granted. The Tax Plan gives current stockholders the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a 32 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a set price of $30.92 which, upon exercise, provides for one additional share of common stock at a 50% discount on the exercise date with no cash settlement options. The Rights under the Tax Plan will expire on October 5, 2020. The Tax Plan reduces the likelihood that changes in our investor base have the unintended effect of limiting the use of our Tax Benefits. There is no impact to the financial statements as a result of the Tax Plan.\nSecurity Control Agreement and Facility Clearance and the U.S. Domestication\nOn January 26, 2017, we, together with our U.S.-based subsidiary, Maxar Holdings, and the U.S. Department of Defense entered into a Security Control Agreement ( SCA\u201d) and began operating under the agreement. On February 2, 2018, the Defense Security Service granted facility clearance for our satellite manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California.\nOn January 1, 2019, we completed our previously announced U.S. Domestication. The U.S. Domestication marked a major milestone in our long-term U.S. Access Plan, enhanced our ability to provide and support classified applications for U.S. government agencies and fulfilled a commitment made in acquiring DigitalGlobe. On January 8, 2020, the SCA was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense, who determined that the SCA was no longer necessary as a result of the U.S. Domestication. The SCA was replaced by a simple Board Resolution that will continue to govern our foreign ownership and controlling interests.\nKey Leadership Changes\nOn January 14, 2019, we announced the appointment of Daniel Jablonsky as President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky, who most recently served as President of DigitalGlobe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxar, also joined the Maxar Board of Directors. He succeeds Howard Lance, who resigned from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of Maxar.\nIn December 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors elected retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Howell M. Estes III as Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2019, coincident with the U.S. Domestication. Gen. Estes, who has served as a director of our Board of Directors since the acquisition of DigitalGlobe, succeeds Robert L. Phillips, who will continue to serve as a director.\nIn July 2018, we announced the appointment of Biggs Porter as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Maxar, effective August 15, 2018. Anil Wirasekara, who previously served as Chief Financial Officer from 1994 to October 2017, assumed the duties of Interim Chief Financial Officer after William McCombe stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in February 2018.\nWorldView-4 Satellite\nDuring December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery. As a result, during December 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $162 million for the remaining book value of the satellite, related assets and future premium payments. On May 3, 2019, we announced that our insurance carriers accepted our $183 million claim for loss arising from the WorldView-4 satellite on orbit failure and agreed to pay us the full amount. As of December 31, 2019, we have collected the full insurance proceeds.\nAcquisition of DigitalGlobe\nOn October 5, 2017, we completed the DigitalGlobe Transaction and renamed the combined company Maxar Technologies Ltd. The transaction created a global leader in Earth imaging and geospatial solutions by combining DigitalGlobe's over 15-year lead in technology and ImageLibrary development, as well as its high-resolution Earth imaging capabilities, with our existing position as a world leader in commercial communications satellites.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to grow in the U.S. and global Earth observation and geospatial services markets through our end-to-end space systems, Earth imagery and geospatial solutions. As a result of the DigitalGlobe Transaction, we increased our scale and we believe, credibility with U.S. government agencies and international government customers. The DigitalGlobe Transaction also added more predictable geospatial data and services revenue while diversifying our product and service offering. With a larger set of customers and end markets, we are better able to increase share in existing markets and grow in adjacent markets.\nOur vision is to be the world's leader in the new space economy. We aim to achieve this by integrating innovative technologies, unique capabilities and end-to-end offerings across our businesses to help our customers address their most complex mission-critical challenges with confidence.\nSegment Results\nIn January 2019, with the appointment of Mr. Jablonsky as our President and Chief Executive Officer, our CODM changed. During the fourth quarter of 2019, following a number of changes, the CODM changed the way in which he assesses performance and allocates resources. As a result, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect how the CODM currently reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. Our CODM measures performance of our reportable segments based on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our operating and reportable segments are: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA. With our announcement of the MDA Transaction on December 30, 2019, the MDA segment has been classified within Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reportable segment change.\nEarth Intelligence\nIn the Earth Intelligence segment, we are a global leader in high resolution space-based optical and radar imagery products and analytics. We launched the world's first high resolution commercial imaging satellite in 1999 and currently operate a four-satellite imaging constellation, providing us with a 110 petabyte historical ImageLibrary of the highest-resolution, commercially available imagery. Our imagery solutions provide customers with timely, accurate and mission-critical information about our changing planet and support a wide variety of government and commercial applications, including mission planning, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, disaster management, crop management, oil and gas exploration and infrastructure management. Our principal customers in the Earth Intelligence segment are U.S. and other international government agencies (primarily defense and intelligence agencies), as well as a\nwide variety of commercial customers in multiple markets. We are a market leader in the commercial satellite Earth observation industry.\nWe also provide geospatial services that combine imagery, analytic expertise and innovative technology to deliver intelligence solutions to customers. Our cleared developers, analysts, and data scientists provide analytic solutions that accurately document change and enable geospatial modeling and analysis that help predict where events will occur. Our primary customer of geospatial services is the U.S. government, but we also support intelligence requirements for other U.S. allied governments, global development organizations and commercial customers.\nThe Earth Intelligence segment includes the financial results of the legacy Imagery and Services segments, excluding the legacy Canadian radar imagery business.\nSpace Infrastructure\nIn the Space Infrastructure segment, we are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure. We design, build, integrate and test solutions for space-based communications satellites, on-orbit servicing, robotic assembly and space exploration. We address a broad spectrum of needs for our customers, including mission systems engineering, product design, spacecraft manufacturing, assembly integration and testing. We provide advanced, reliable, and affordable spacecraft that enable our commercial customers to deliver valuable global services, and we are successfully partnering with the U.S. government in new space opportunities. Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide.\nThe Space Infrastructure segment includes the financial results of our legacy Space Solutions business (previously referred to as Space Systems/Loral LLC or SSL) which was previously included within our legacy Space Systems segment.\nMDA\nIn the MDA segment, we are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure in Canada. We develop and deliver advanced surveillance and intelligence solutions, defense and maritime systems, radar geospatial imagery, space robotics, satellite antennas and communication subsystems. The MDA segment includes the financial results of the MDA and legacy radar imagery business. We have a long history in space robotics, having developed the Canadarms for NASA's Space Shuttle program and Canadarm2, which is currently in service on the International Space Station. Our principal customers in the MDA segment are the Canadian government and other government and commercial customers worldwide. As discussed above, in connection with the MDA Transaction, the financial results from this segment were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides selected annual financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n *Not meaningful.\nProduct and service revenue\n\nTotal revenues decreased to $1,666 million from $1,804 million, or by $138 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue in our Space Infrastructure segment partially offset by an increase in revenue in our Earth Intelligence segment. Further discussion of the drivers behind the decrease in revenues within the Results by Segment\u201d section below.\nTotal revenues increased to $1,804 million from $1,257 million, or by $547 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of revenue related to the DigitalGlobe Transaction as compared with only approximately one quarter of revenues in 2017. The increase in revenue from the Earth Intelligence segment was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the\nSpace Infrastructure segment. Further discussion of the drivers behind the decrease in revenues within the Space Infrastructure segment is included within the Results by Segment\u201d section below.\nSee Note 17, Segment Information\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for product and service revenues by segment.\nProduct and service costs\n\nTotal cost of product and services decreased to $975 million from $1,088 million, or by $113 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease is primarily driven by lower costs within the Space Infrastructure segment driven by lower volume which was partially offset by an increase in costs in our Earth Intelligence segment which was primarily driven by an increase in the labor associated with providing geospatial services.\nTotal cost of product and services increased to $1,088 million from $924 million, or by $164 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase is primarily related to the inclusion of a full year of costs related to the DigitalGlobe Transaction compared to only approximately one quarter in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased to $325 million from $446 million, or by $121 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in research and development spend of $78 million, a $19 million decrease in integration expense related to the DigitalGlobe Transaction and a decrease in labor related expenses due to a reduction of headcount from actions taken during the first quarter of 2019.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased to $446 million from $337 million, or by $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by inclusion of a full year of costs related to the DigitalGlobe Transaction compared to only approximately one quarter in 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased to $376 million from $439 million, or by $63 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense following asset impairments in the second half of 2018.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $439 million from $152 million, or by $287 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of depreciation and amortization expense related to the acquisition of DigitalGlobe as compared to approximately one quarter of depreciation and amortization expense in 2017.\nImpairment losses\n *Not meaningful.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized impairment losses of $14 million primarily related to orbital receivables within the Space Infrastructure segment due to a decrease in customer credit ratings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $586 million of impairment losses. We recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $159 million related to our Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure segments which was a result of the sustained decline in our stock price and the further decline in the geostationary satellite manufacturing business ( GeoComm\u201d) in our Space Infrastructure segment. We also recognized impairment losses of $122 million related to intangible assets and $121 million related to property, plant and equipment within the Space Infrastructure segment. Additionally, we recorded a $22 million impairment related to orbital receivables within the Space Infrastructure segment primarily due to a decrease in customer credit rating. In December 2018, we lost the imaging capability of our WorldView-4 satellite, resulting in a loss of $162 million on the satellite, related assets, and future premium payments.\nSatellite insurance recovery\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we received insurance recoveries of $183 million related to the loss of imaging capability of our WorldView-4 satellite in December 2018.\nGain on sale of assets\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of solutions in Earth Intelligence and Space Infrastructure. We help government and commercial customers to monitor, understand and navigate the changing planet; deliver global broadband communications; and explore and advance the use of space. Our approach combines decades of deep mission understanding and a proven commercial and defense foundation to deliver our services with speed, scale and cost effectiveness.\nOur businesses are organized and managed in three reportable segments: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA, as described below under Segment Results.\u201d\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nDefinitive Agreement to Sell MDA\nOn December 29, 2019, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement ( MDA Agreement\u201d), with Neptune Acquisition Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia and an affiliate of Northern Private\nCapital Ltd. ( MDA Purchaser\u201d) that provides for, among other things, the MDA Purchaser to purchase MDA, our Canadian subsidiary, from us for an aggregate purchase price of approximately C$1.0 billion ( MDA Transaction\u201d). The MDA Transaction is subject to customary purchase price adjustments for working capital, cash and debt, and as otherwise described below. Pursuant to the MDA Agreement, the MDA Purchaser will acquire all of the outstanding shares in the entities that operate our MDA business.\nThe closing of the MDA Transaction is conditioned on customary closing conditions and on specified regulatory approvals, including review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, Hart-Scott-Rodino review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and Canadian government reviews under the Radiocommunication Act and the Competition Act. The closing of the MDA Transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the Spring or early Summer of 2020.\nThe MDA Agreement contains specified termination rights for us and the MDA Purchaser, including, among others, if the consummation of the MDA Transaction has not occurred by June 29, 2020, subject to extension to September 29, 2020 for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Canada and appealing any injunctions preventing the consummation of the MDA Transaction.\nThe MDA Agreement contains a negative purchase price adjustment of up to C$65 million for a complete loss or failure of RADARSAT-2, such that it cannot be used for its intended commercial purposes.\nThe MDA Agreement provides that the MDA Purchaser will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee of C$55 million under specified circumstances, including, among others, where the MDA Agreement is terminated because (i) the MDA Purchaser has materially breached its representations and warranties or the MDA Purchaser fails to perform its covenants in all material respects, subject to a cure period, or (ii) all of the conditions to closing of the MDA Transaction (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at closing) have been satisfied or waived, we have confirmed in writing to the MDA Purchaser that we stand ready, willing and able to consummate the MDA Transaction and the MDA Purchaser fails to consummate the closing (including for a failure of the MDA Purchaser's debt financing) within two business days of receipt of the notice from us.\nSenior Secured 2023 Notes\nIn December 2019, we issued $1.0 billion in principal amount of 9.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2023 ( 2023 Notes\u201d) in a private placement to institutional buyers. The 2023 Notes were issued at a price of 98%. The 2023 Notes bear interest at the rate of 9.75% per year, payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, which interest payments will commence in June 2020. The 2023 Notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of our existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nThe proceeds from the 2023 Notes and the sale of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California were used to repay the outstanding borrowings under our existing senior secured first lien term A facility ( Term Loan A\u201d) and the majority of the outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility.\nConcurrent Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility\nOn November 4, 2019, we further amended our Original Syndicated Credit Facility (the Third Amending Agreement\u201d), certain portions of which became effective immediately and certain portions of which became effective in December 2019 upon the issuance of the 2023 Notes ( Effective Date\u201d). The Third Amending Agreement, during the Covenant Relief Period, (i) modified the priority of the application of certain voluntary prepayments resulting from certain asset sales (but which did not affect the prepayments owed to the Term Loan B), and (ii) restricted use of proceeds of future borrowings. In addition, the Third Amending Agreement increased the maximum consolidated debt leverage ratios permitted under the Original Syndicated Credit Facility to 7.25x at the end of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, 7.50x at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020, 7.75x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2021, 7.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the quarter ending September 30, 2022, 6.50x at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter until the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023, and 5.75x for each fiscal quarter thereafter (subject to a 0.25x reduction in each maximum level upon a disposition of a\nbusiness line for greater than $500 million). The Third Amending Agreement also extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility by two years to December 2023, updated the Interest Coverage Ratio to be less than 2.0x at the end of each fiscal quarter, restricted investment capacity in certain permitted investments, restricted future increases in quarterly dividend payment levels and modified certain margin and standby fee terms. In addition, we canceled the operating credit facility and reduced committed borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility from $1.25 billion to $500 million.\nSale Leaseback Agreements\nOn December 10, 2019, we completed the sale and subsequent leaseback of our owned properties in Palo Alto, California for proceeds of $291 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of the properties of $136 million, which was adjusted for off-market leaseback terms and is included in Gain on sale of assets in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We recorded operating lease assets and liabilities of $63 million, representing the fair value of the minimum lease payments associated with the agreements to lease assets back over a period of two to ten years; and recognized a deferred financing liability of $33 million for the above-market rent stipulated in the lease agreements which included in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTax Benefit Preservation Plan\nOn May 12, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan ( Tax Plan\u201d), which our Stockholders subsequently approved on October 31, 2019, with the intent to preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits ( Tax Benefits\u201d) including those generated by net operating losses. The Tax Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or entity acquiring shares of the Company equal to or exceeding 4.9%. For each common stock outstanding as of May 28, 2019, a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right ( The Rights\u201d) is granted. The Tax Plan gives current stockholders the right to purchase one one-hundredth of a 32 share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at a set price of $30.92 which, upon exercise, provides for one additional share of common stock at a 50% discount on the exercise date with no cash settlement options. The Rights under the Tax Plan will expire on October 5, 2020. The Tax Plan reduces the likelihood that changes in our investor base have the unintended effect of limiting the use of our Tax Benefits. There is no impact to the financial statements as a result of the Tax Plan.\nSecurity Control Agreement and Facility Clearance and the U.S. Domestication\nOn January 26, 2017, we, together with our U.S.-based subsidiary, Maxar Holdings, and the U.S. Department of Defense entered into a Security Control Agreement ( SCA\u201d) and began operating under the agreement. On February 2, 2018, the Defense Security Service granted facility clearance for our satellite manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California.\nOn January 1, 2019, we completed our previously announced U.S. Domestication. The U.S. Domestication marked a major milestone in our long-term U.S. Access Plan, enhanced our ability to provide and support classified applications for U.S. government agencies and fulfilled a commitment made in acquiring DigitalGlobe. On January 8, 2020, the SCA was terminated by the U.S. Department of Defense, who determined that the SCA was no longer necessary as a result of the U.S. Domestication. The SCA was replaced by a simple Board Resolution that will continue to govern our foreign ownership and controlling interests.\nKey Leadership Changes\nOn January 14, 2019, we announced the appointment of Daniel Jablonsky as President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxar. Mr. Jablonsky, who most recently served as President of DigitalGlobe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Maxar, also joined the Maxar Board of Directors. He succeeds Howard Lance, who resigned from his roles as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of Maxar.\nIn December 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors elected retired U.S. Air Force Gen. Howell M. Estes III as Chairman of the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2019, coincident with the U.S. Domestication. Gen. Estes, who has served as a director of our Board of Directors since the acquisition of DigitalGlobe, succeeds Robert L. Phillips, who will continue to serve as a director.\nIn July 2018, we announced the appointment of Biggs Porter as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Maxar, effective August 15, 2018. Anil Wirasekara, who previously served as Chief Financial Officer from 1994 to October 2017, assumed the duties of Interim Chief Financial Officer after William McCombe stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in February 2018.\nWorldView-4 Satellite\nDuring December 2018, our WorldView-4 satellite experienced a failure in its control moment gyros, preventing the satellite from collecting imagery. As a result, during December 2018, we recorded an impairment loss of $162 million for the remaining book value of the satellite, related assets and future premium payments. On May 3, 2019, we announced that our insurance carriers accepted our $183 million claim for loss arising from the WorldView-4 satellite on orbit failure and agreed to pay us the full amount. As of December 31, 2019, we have collected the full insurance proceeds.\nAcquisition of DigitalGlobe\nOn October 5, 2017, we completed the DigitalGlobe Transaction and renamed the combined company Maxar Technologies Ltd. The transaction created a global leader in Earth imaging and geospatial solutions by combining DigitalGlobe's over 15-year lead in technology and ImageLibrary development, as well as its high-resolution Earth imaging capabilities, with our existing position as a world leader in commercial communications satellites.\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to grow in the U.S. and global Earth observation and geospatial services markets through our end-to-end space systems, Earth imagery and geospatial solutions. As a result of the DigitalGlobe Transaction, we increased our scale and we believe, credibility with U.S. government agencies and international government customers. The DigitalGlobe Transaction also added more predictable geospatial data and services revenue while diversifying our product and service offering. With a larger set of customers and end markets, we are better able to increase share in existing markets and grow in adjacent markets.\nOur vision is to be the world's leader in the new space economy. We aim to achieve this by integrating innovative technologies, unique capabilities and end-to-end offerings across our businesses to help our customers address their most complex mission-critical challenges with confidence.\nSegment Results\nIn January 2019, with the appointment of Mr. Jablonsky as our President and Chief Executive Officer, our CODM changed. During the fourth quarter of 2019, following a number of changes, the CODM changed the way in which he assesses performance and allocates resources. As a result, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect how the CODM currently reviews financial information and makes operating decisions. Our CODM measures performance of our reportable segments based on revenue and Adjusted EBITDA. Our operating and reportable segments are: Earth Intelligence, Space Infrastructure and MDA. With our announcement of the MDA Transaction on December 30, 2019, the MDA segment has been classified within Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reportable segment change.\nEarth Intelligence\nIn the Earth Intelligence segment, we are a global leader in high resolution space-based optical and radar imagery products and analytics. We launched the world's first high resolution commercial imaging satellite in 1999 and currently operate a four-satellite imaging constellation, providing us with a 110 petabyte historical ImageLibrary of the highest-resolution, commercially available imagery. Our imagery solutions provide customers with timely, accurate and mission-critical information about our changing planet and support a wide variety of government and commercial applications, including mission planning, mapping and analysis, environmental monitoring, disaster management, crop management, oil and gas exploration and infrastructure management. Our principal customers in the Earth Intelligence segment are U.S. and other international government agencies (primarily defense and intelligence agencies), as well as a\nwide variety of commercial customers in multiple markets. We are a market leader in the commercial satellite Earth observation industry.\nWe also provide geospatial services that combine imagery, analytic expertise and innovative technology to deliver intelligence solutions to customers. Our cleared developers, analysts, and data scientists provide analytic solutions that accurately document change and enable geospatial modeling and analysis that help predict where events will occur. Our primary customer of geospatial services is the U.S. government, but we also support intelligence requirements for other U.S. allied governments, global development organizations and commercial customers.\nThe Earth Intelligence segment includes the financial results of the legacy Imagery and Services segments, excluding the legacy Canadian radar imagery business.\nSpace Infrastructure\nIn the Space Infrastructure segment, we are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure. We design, build, integrate and test solutions for space-based communications satellites, on-orbit servicing, robotic assembly and space exploration. We address a broad spectrum of needs for our customers, including mission systems engineering, product design, spacecraft manufacturing, assembly integration and testing. We provide advanced, reliable, and affordable spacecraft that enable our commercial customers to deliver valuable global services, and we are successfully partnering with the U.S. government in new space opportunities. Our principal customers in the Space Infrastructure segment are commercial satellite operators and government agencies worldwide.\nThe Space Infrastructure segment includes the financial results of our legacy Space Solutions business (previously referred to as Space Systems/Loral LLC or SSL) which was previously included within our legacy Space Systems segment.\nMDA\nIn the MDA segment, we are a leading provider of Space Infrastructure in Canada. We develop and deliver advanced surveillance and intelligence solutions, defense and maritime systems, radar geospatial imagery, space robotics, satellite antennas and communication subsystems. The MDA segment includes the financial results of the MDA and legacy radar imagery business. We have a long history in space robotics, having developed the Canadarms for NASA's Space Shuttle program and Canadarm2, which is currently in service on the International Space Station. Our principal customers in the MDA segment are the Canadian government and other government and commercial customers worldwide. As discussed above, in connection with the MDA Transaction, the financial results from this segment were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table provides selected annual financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue in our Space Infrastructure segment partially offset by an increase in revenue in our Earth Intelligence segment. Further discussion of the drivers behind the decrease in revenues within the Results by Segment\u201d section below.\nTotal revenues increased to $1,804 million from $1,257 million, or by $547 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in revenues was primarily driven by the inclusion of a full year of revenue related to the DigitalGlobe Transaction as compared with only approximately one quarter of revenues in 2017. The increase in revenue from the Earth Intelligence segment was partially offset by a decrease in revenue in the\nSpace Infrastructure segment. Further discussion of the drivers behind the decrease in revenues within the Space Infrastructure segment is included within the Results by Segment\u201d section below.\nSee Note 17, Segment Information\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for product and service revenues by segment.\nProduct and service costs\nTable 69: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 to 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 to 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>($ millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product costs, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (182)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service costs, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 1,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (113)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal cost of product and services decreased to $975 million from $1,088 million, or by $113 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018.
