Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ substantially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in this Item 7, in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. These forward-looking statements reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date such forward-looking statements are made. Except as required by law, we assume no responsibility for updating any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report and other reports and filings made with the SEC.\nOverview\nKratos is a mid-tier government contractor at the forefront of the DoD's Third Offset Strategy. Kratos is a leading technology, intellectual property and proprietary product and solution company focused on the U.S. and its allies' national security. Kratos' primary focus areas are unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security/warfare, missile defense and combat systems. We believe that our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products and designed-in positions on our customers' platforms and systems is a competitive advantage and high barrier to entry into our markets. Our work force is primarily technically oriented and highly skilled with a significant number holding national security clearances. Our entire organization is focused on executing our strategy of becoming the leading technology and intellectual property based company in our industry.\nOur primary end customers are U.S. Government agencies, including the DoD, classified agencies, intelligence agencies, other national security agencies and homeland security related agencies. We also conduct business with local, state and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated 60%, 61% and 57%, respectively, of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government (including all branches of the U.S. military), either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We believe our stable customer base, strong customer relationships, intellectual property, specialized and differentiated products, broad array of contract vehicles, designed in\u201d positions on strategic national security platforms, our targeted investments in strategic growth areas, large employee base possessing specialized skills, security clearances, specialized manufacturing facilities and equipment, extensive list of past performance qualifications, and significant management and operational capabilities position us for success.\nWe were incorporated in the state of New York on December 19, 1994 and began operations in March 1995. We reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1998.\nIndustry Background\nFaced with significant budget pressures, in recent years the U.S. Government has implemented reductions in government spending, including reductions in appropriations for the DoD and other federal agencies, pursuant to the BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a sequestration went into effect in March 2013 resulting in a 7.8% reduction to the DoD budget for FY 2013 to $495.5 billion, excluding funding for military personnel. The DoD budget was approximately $496.0 billion in FY 2014 and remained at a similar level in FY 2015. The DoD base budget excludes funding for overseas contingency operations, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which are appropriated separately and are not currently subject to the BCA.\nOn November 2, 2015, Barack Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, formalizing the terms of a two year budget agreement which raised the U.S. debt ceiling and lifted the sequestration spending caps by $80.0 billion. Under the budget agreement, the total federal spending increase over the BCA topline funding caps was $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, with the amounts divided equally between defense and domestic priorities. The overall discretionary budget was set at $1.067 trillion in FY 2016 and $1.07 trillion in FY 2017. The FY 2016 discretionary defense budget was $548.1 billion, a $25.0 billion increase over the BCA topline funding caps.\nUnder the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Obama Administration received $33.0 billion of the $38.0 billion national defense spending increase it sought in FY 2016. In summary the budget agreement:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>extended the BCA out to 2025;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>suspended the U.S. debt limit/ceiling until March 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased spending caps for FY 2016 and FY 2017 by $80.0 billion, including $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, split evenly between defense and domestic priorities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>included a FY 2016 DoD base budget of $548.0 billion and a FY 2016 overseas contingency operation budget of $59.0 billion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 18, 2015, Congress passed and Mr. Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provided funding for the U.S. Government for FY 2016, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through September 2016. Mr. Obama signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016, and provides funding for the U.S. Government at FY 2016 levels through April 28, 2017.\nCurrent Reporting Segments\nThe Company operates in three reportable segments. The KGS reportable segment is comprised of an aggregation of KGS operating segments, including our microwave electronic products, satellite communications, modular systems and rocket support operating segments. The US reportable segment consists of our unmanned aerial system and unmanned ground and seaborne system businesses. The PSS reportable segment provides independent integrated solutions for advanced homeland security, public safety, critical infrastructure, and security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications. We organize our business segments based primarily on the nature of the products, solutions and services offered. For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. From a customer and solutions perspective, we view our business as an integrated whole, leveraging skills and assets wherever possible.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn August 21, 2015, the Company completed the sale of the U.S. and U.K. operations of its Electronic Products Division to Ultra Electronics Holdings plc ( Ultra\u201d), a public limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales and traded on the London Stock Exchange, and Ultra Electronics Defense Inc. (the Buyer\u201d), a Delaware corporation ultimately owned by Ultra (the Transaction\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated May 31, 2015, by and among the Company, Ultra and the Buyer, the Company sold to the Buyer all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiary Herley Industries, Inc. ( Herley\u201d) and certain of Herley's subsidiaries, including Herley-CTI, Inc., EW Simulation Technology, Ltd. and Stapor Research, Inc. (collectively, the Herley Entities\u201d), for $260.0 million and $5.0 million for taxes incurred as part of the Transaction, less a $2.0 million escrow to satisfy any purchase price adjustments and a working capital adjustment of approximately $8.3 million.\nIn November 2015, the Company and Ultra settled the working capital adjustment at $8.1 million, and the net cash position at closing, resulting in a net payment to the Company of $2.7 million. This represents the payment from escrow to the Company of $2.0 million, as well as the payment from Ultra of $0.7 million, reflecting the difference in the estimated working\ncapital and actual working capital and the net cash position at the close of the Transaction. In December 2015, the Company submitted to Ultra for reimbursement the maximum $5.0 million for taxes incurred as part of the Transaction, which was reimbursed in January 2016. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKey Financial Statement Concepts\nAs of December 25, 2016, we consider the following factors to be important in understanding our financial statements.\nKGS' and US' business with the U.S. Government and prime contractors is generally performed under fixed-price, cost reimbursable, or time and materials contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts for the U.S. Government provide for reimbursement of costs plus the payment of a fee. Some cost reimbursable contracts include incentive fees that are awarded based on performance on the contract. Under time and materials contracts, we are reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and reimbursed for travel and other direct expenses at actual costs plus applied general and administrative expenses. In accounting for our long-term contracts for production of products and services provided to the U.S. Government and provided to our PSS segment customers under fixed-price contracts, we utilize both cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under the units delivered measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, sales are recognized as the units are accepted by the customer generally using sales values for units in accordance with the contract terms. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries or as computed on the basis of the estimated final average unit costs plus profit. We classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending upon the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.\nWe consider the following factors when determining if collection of a receivable is reasonably assured: comprehensive collection history; results of our communications with customers; the current financial position of the customer; and the relevant economic conditions in the customer's country. If we have had no prior experience with the customer, we may review reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors in a reliable and effective manner. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and adversely affect their financial ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Additionally, on certain contracts whereby we perform services for a prime/general contractor, a specified percentage of the invoiced trade accounts receivable may be retained by the customer until we complete the project. We periodically review all retainages for collectability and record allowances for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate, based on our assessment of the associated risks.\nWe monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are routinely audited by the DCAA.\nWe manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations with consideration given to our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates discussed below. Due to the Federal Acquisition Regulation rules that govern our business, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as cost of sales or general and administrative costs) as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, and operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income. Changes in contract estimates are reviewed on a contract-by-contract basis and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision in accordance with GAAP. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete the project, which determine the project's percentage complete, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the Year Ended December 25, 2016 to the Year ended December 27, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues by reportable segment for the years ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kratos Government Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>244.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Kratos Government Solutions\n</td> <td>465.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Safety & Security - service revenues\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unmanned Systems - product sales\n</td> <td>75.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total product sales\n</td> <td>320.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues increased $11.6 million to $668.7 million in 2016 from $657.1 million in 2015. The increase in revenues was the result of increased revenues of $19.7 million in our KGS segment primarily resulting from increased shipments and work performed in our satellite communications business of approximately $21.1 million, our simulation and training business of approximately $6.7 million and our ballistic missile target businesses of approximately $8.6 million, offset by a reduction in shipments of our specialized ground equipment products resulting primarily from delays in contract awards of $11.8 million and other reductions primarily in our government services business, which includes our weapons reset business, of approximately $4.9 million. Increased revenues of $9.5 million in our US segment resulted from recent contract awards in unmanned combat aerial systems and unmanned aerial target systems as well as an increase in shipments of unmanned aerial target systems. Declines in our PSS segment of $17.6 million were primarily the result of our change in strategic direction in the fourth quarter of 2014 to capture higher margin work and only selectively bid on larger security integration projects that traditionally generate lower margins, coupled with the impact of approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth recorded during 2016 which negatively impacted our revenues. This unexpected cost growth is primarily related to several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion in 2017.\nProduct sales increased $17.7 million to $320.6 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $302.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, primarily as a result of the increase in product shipments due to the factors discussed above in our KGS and US segments. As a percentage of total revenue, product revenues were 47.9% for the year ended December 25, 2016 as compared to 46.1% for the year ended December 27, 2015. Service revenues decreased by $6.1 million to $348.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $354.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the change in strategic direction and the completion of larger security installation projects in our PSS segment, offset partially by increases in our KGS segment as discussed above.\nAs described in our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates\u201d below and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report, we utilize both the cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue as provided for in Topic 605. When revenue is calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, total costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated costs to complete the contract. These estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract basis, and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete projects, which determine the project's percentage of completion, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates. During the reporting periods contained herein, we did experience revenue and margin adjustments on certain projects based on the aforementioned factors, but the effect of such adjustments, both positive and negative, when evaluated in total were determined to be immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $515.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $495.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The $19.8 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily a result of increased revenue discussed above, as well as an $18.7 million loss accrual recorded in 2016 on the LCASD cost share contract, which is expected to be incurred by the Company over the period of performance of the contract, and was incurred in order to retain the intellectual property rights for the new LCASD platform. Cost of revenues was also impacted by approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth on PSS projects recorded during 2016 which negatively impacted our revenues. This unexpected cost growth is primarily related to several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion in 2017.\nGross margin percentage decreased to 23.0% for the year ended December 25, 2016 compared to 24.6% for the year ended December 27, 2015. Margins on services increased to 26.5% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 24.8% for the year ended December 27, 2015, due primarily to a more favorable mix of revenues. Margins on product sales decreased for the year ended December 25, 2016 as compared to December 27, 2015 to 19.1% from 24.5%, respectively, primarily as a result of a change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the KGS segment increased to 26.3% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 25.4% for the year ended December 27, 2015, primarily as a result of change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the US segment decreased to (2.9)% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 16.3% for the year ended December 27, 2015, reflecting an $18.7 million loss accrual recorded on the LCASD cost share contract, which is expected to be incurred by the Company over the period of performance of the contract, and was incurred in order to retain the intellectual property rights for the new LCASD platform. Margins in the PSS segment increased slightly to 26.1% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 26.0% for the year ended December 27, 2015 as a result of a more favorable mix of revenues, resulting from the strategic shift in focus on smaller sized, higher margin projects and only selectively bidding on larger sized lower margin projects, the completion of certain lower margin projects, as well as the impact of cost reduction actions that were taken during the year ended December 25, 2016, offset partially by the impact of approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth recorded during 2016 on several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). SG&A decreased $4.4 million to $146.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $150.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a $2.5 million reduction of amortization of intangibles in 2016, as a result of certain intangible assets being fully amortized, as well as cost reduction actions taken by the Company, offset partially by increased discretionary investments to pursue business opportunities in the unmanned tactical aircraft market. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 21.9% for fiscal 2016 from 22.9% for fiscal 2015. Excluding amortization of intangibles of $10.5 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 and amortization of intangibles of $13.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, SG&A decreased as a percentage of revenues to 20.3% from 21.0% for the year ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively, due primarily to the cost reduction actions the Company has taken and the increased leverage on the Company's public company infrastructure costs as revenues expand.\nInternal research and development (IR&D) expenses. IR&D expenses decreased to $13.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, IR&D decreased to 2.1% of revenues for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 2.5% of revenues for the year ended December 27, 2015. IR&D expenditures are primarily related to investments we are making in conjunction with our customers and prospective customers, with the objectives of the Company's products being the new platform for or designed in\u201d to certain new long term program opportunities and the Company owning certain intellectual property rights for products that support these programs primarily in our unmanned systems and microwave electronic businesses as well as technology upgrades and refresh activities that are necessary for the next generation of our existing product lines primarily in our satellite communications business.\nMerger and acquisition related items. Merger and acquisition related items increased to $1.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $0.1 million in the year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily as a result of a $1.9 million charge related to the settlement of a contract dispute in our PSS business during the first quarter of 2016.\nUnused office space and other restructuring. The expense of $10.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 was due to a $9.2 million charge that was recorded in the Company's modular systems business as a result of the closure of one of its manufacturing facilities, as well as, the exit from certain lower margin product business lines and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken in the first quarter of 2016. The restructuring charge recorded in our modular systems business was comprised of $4.9 million related to fixed and intangible assets, of which $1.4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting the write-down to estimated fair value of one of its facilities, $3.0 million related to exited product lines and $1.3 million related to excess facilities. The benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 was due to a reduction in the liability for unused office space at our Columbia, Maryland facility resulting from the execution of a recent sublease arrangement, partially offset by an impairment of leasehold improvements, office furniture and equipment at that location, and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken during the year.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net decreased to $33.7 million from $40.1 million for the years ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively. The decrease in expense of $6.4 million was primarily related to a $3.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the 10% Notes in the third quarter of 2015, a reduction in interest expense of $1.3 million as a result of the redemption of $175.0 million of our Notes and the repayment of $41.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement in the third quarter of 2015 which both occurred as a result of our divestiture of the Herley Entities.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations. The provision for income taxes from continuing operations changed to an expense of $8.1 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $52.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from a benefit of $11.4 million on a loss of $44.6 million from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 27, 2015. The expense for the year ended December 25, 2016 was primarily comprised of a provision for foreign and state taxes increased by the change in the indefinite life deferred tax liability. The benefit for the year ended December 27, 2015 was primarily due to the intra-period allocation rules in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Intra-period allocation rules require the Company to allocate its provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations. In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations, the Company must allocate the tax provision to other categories of earnings. A related tax benefit is then recorded in continuing operations. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our income taxes.\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations. There was no significant activity for the year ended December 25, 2016. The loss from discontinued operations was $0.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016, compared to income of $53.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, which included the gain on sale of the Herley Entities of $80.8 million which occurred on August 21, 2015. The income for the year ended December 27, 2015 also reflects interest expense allocated to discontinued operations of $9.1 million.

The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to our PSS business due in part to a one-time shipment of sophisticated communication equipment of $13.0 million that occurred in the second quarter of 2014, as well as due to the completion or wind-down of certain security installation projects and due to the Company's change in strategic direction in the fourth quarter of 2014 to capture higher margin work and only selectively bid on larger security integration projects that traditionally generate lower margins, resulting in aggregate reduced service revenues in the PSS segment of $38.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. In addition,\nfor the year ended December 27, 2015, KGS segment revenue decreased by $39.0 million due primarily to reduced shipments of our specialized ground equipment products of $38.6 million, delays in orders and awards as a result of the challenging federal government and DoD funding environment, and continued reduction in our legacy government services business of $14.7 million, which includes reset work on legacy weapons systems, all of which adversely impacted the timing of new contract awards, bookings and our revenues, offset partially by growth in our simulation and training business and in technical government services where we support directed energy weapons and electromagnetic railgun efforts, which aggregated a net increase of $16.4 million. Revenues in our US segment decreased by $15.2 million primarily as a result of a reduction in shipments of certain of our aerial target products due to delays in the timing of follow-on and new international contract awards.\nProduct sales decreased $69.3 million to $302.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $372.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2014, primarily as a result of the decline in product shipments due to the factors discussed above in our KGS, PSS and US segments. As a percentage of total revenue, product revenues were 46.1% for the year ended December 27, 2015 as compared to 48.8% for the year ended December 28, 2014. Service revenues decreased by $36.6 million to $354.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $390.8 million for the year ended December 28, 2014. The decrease was primarily related to the change in strategic direction and the completion of larger security installation projects in our PSS segment as well as the continued reduction in our legacy government services business as discussed above.\nAs described in our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates\u201d below and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report, we utilize both the cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue as provided for in Topic 605. When revenue is calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, total costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated costs to complete the contract. These estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract basis, and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete projects, which determine the project's percentage of completion, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates. During the reporting periods contained herein, we did experience revenue and margin adjustments on certain projects based on the aforementioned factors, but the effect of such adjustments, both positive and negative, when evaluated in total were determined to be immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues decreased to $495.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $583.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2014. The $88.3 million decrease in cost of revenues was primarily a result of decreased revenue discussed above.\nGross margin percentage increased to 24.6% for the year ended December 27, 2015 from 23.5% for the year ended December 28, 2014. Margins on services increased to 24.8% for the year ended December 27, 2015 from 22.1% for the year ended December 28, 2014, due primarily to a more favorable mix of revenues. Margins on product sales decreased for the year ended December 27, 2015 as compared to December 28, 2014 to 24.5% from 25.0%, respectively, primarily as a result of a change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the KGS segment increased to 25.4% for the year ended December 27, 2015 from 25.3% for the year ended December 28, 2014, primarily as a result of change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the US segment decreased to 16.3% for the year ended December 27, 2015 from 23.2% for the year ended December 28, 2014, primarily due to a less favorable mix of products produced and shipped and due to increased contract costs primarily reflecting retrofits required to conform to required design configuration changes identified in recent successful demonstration test flights recorded on certain international aerial target projects in the year ended December 27, 2015. Margins in the PSS segment increased to 26.0% for the year ended December 27, 2015 from 19.3% for the year ended December 28, 2014 as a result of a more favorable mix of revenues, resulting from the strategic shift in focus on smaller sized, higher margin projects and only selectively bidding on larger sized lower margin projects, the completion of certain lower margin projects, as well as the impact of cost reduction actions that were taken during the year ended December 27, 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). SG&A decreased $2.9 million to $150.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $153.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2014. The decrease was primarily the result of a $6.1 million reduction of amortization of intangibles in 2015, as a result of certain intangible assets being fully amortized, as well as cost reduction actions taken by the Company, offset partially by increased discretionary investments to pursue business opportunities in the unmanned tactical aircraft market. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A increased to 22.9% for fiscal 2015 from 20.1% for fiscal 2014. Excluding amortization of intangibles of $13.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 and amortization of intangibles of $19.1 million for the year ended December 28, 2014, SG&A increased as a percentage of revenues to 21.0% from 17.6% for the year ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively, due primarily to the decline in revenues discussed previously, as well as the impact of the public company corporate SG&A costs which are not\nallocable to the Herley Entities which have been classified as discontinued operations. In addition, due to contract award delays specifically in our unmanned and modular systems businesses, the reduced volumes have resulted in increased unabsorbed overhead costs.\nInternal research and development (IR&D) expenses. IR&D expenses decreased to $16.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $18.6 million for the year ended December 28, 2014. As a percentage of revenues, IR&D increased to 2.5% of revenues for the year ended December 27, 2015 from 2.4% of revenues for the year ended December 28, 2014. IR&D expenditures are primarily related to investments we are making in conjunction with our customers and prospective customers, with the objectives of the Company's products being the new platform for or designed in\u201d to certain new long term program opportunities and the Company owning certain intellectual property rights for products that support these programs primarily in our unmanned systems and microwave electronic businesses as well as technology upgrades and refresh activities that are necessary for the next generation of our existing product lines primarily in our satellite communications business.\nUnused office space and other restructuring. The benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 was due to a reduction of the liability for unused office space at our Columbia, Maryland facility resulting from the execution of a recent sublease arrangement, partially offset by an impairment of leasehold improvements and office furniture and equipment at that location, and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken during the year. The expense of $1.7 million for the year ended December 28, 2014 was primarily due to an estimated excess facility accrual of office space at our Sacramento, California administrative facilities, and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken during the year.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net decreased to $40.1 million from $77.1 million for the years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively. The decrease in expense of $37.0 million was primarily related to $39.1 million loss on the extinguishment of the 10% Notes in the second quarter of 2014 and a reduction in interest expense as a result of the refinancing of our 10% Notes with our 7% Notes.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes. The provision for income taxes changed to a benefit of $11.4 million on a loss before income taxes of $44.6 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from a provision of $3.9 million on a loss of $71.8 million from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 28, 2014. The benefit for the year ended December 27, 2015 was primarily due to the intra-period allocation rules in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Intra-period allocation rules require the Company to allocate its provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations. In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations, the Company must allocate the tax provision to other categories of earnings. A related tax benefit is then recorded in continuing operations. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our income taxes. The provision for the year ended December 28, 2014 was primarily comprised of a provision for foreign and state taxes increased by the change in the indefinite life deferred tax liability.\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations. Revenue from discontinued operations decreased to $59.7 million from $108.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively. The reduction is primarily due to the sale of the Herley Entities which occurred on August 21, 2015, and therefore reflects the operating performance through the date of sale compared to a full year's operating results for the comparable prior year. The income from discontinued operations was $53.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 which includes the gain on sale of the Herley Entities of $80.8 million and the net loss from discontinued operations was $2.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2014. The loss and income for the two years also reflects interest expense allocated to discontinued operations of $9.1 million and $15.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 25, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $69.1 million compared with cash and cash equivalents of $28.5 million as of December 27, 2015, which includes $5.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. We are not presently aware of any restrictions on the repatriation of these funds, however, they are essentially considered permanently invested in these foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed to fund our operations or satisfy obligations in the U.S. they could be repatriated, and their repatriation into the U.S. may cause us to incur additional U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. Any additional taxes could be offset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is not practicable to determine the\nincome tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be repatriated. We do not currently intend to repatriate these earnings.\nOn November 23, 2016, we sold approximately 13.4 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $6.00 per share in an underwritten public offering. We received gross proceeds of approximately $80.5 million. After deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses, we received approximately $76.2 million in net proceeds. We used $14.1 million of the net proceeds from this transaction to buy back and redeem approximately $14.5 million of our Notes, and we used $5.1 million to fund a strategic initial investment in a satellite signal monitoring, signal intelligence and location identification technology and product line to enhance our existing satellite communications business offering. The remainder of the funds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including funding expected growth and strategic investments in our high performance unmanned aerial vehicle business area and other new programs under contract.\nOur total debt, including capital lease obligations, principal due on the Notes, other term debt, the discount of $2.4 million on the Notes issued, and debt issuance costs of $2.9 million, decreased by $13.1 million to $432.0 million as of December 25, 2016 from $445.1 million as of December 27, 2015. The decrease in debt was due to the buy back and redemption of approximately $14.5 million of Notes which occurred in the quarter ended December 25, 2016.\nWe use our operating cash flow to finance trade accounts receivable, fund necessary increases in inventory, fund capital expenditures, our IR&D investments, and our ongoing operations, service our debt and make strategic acquisitions. Financing trade accounts receivable is necessary because, on average, our customers do not pay us as quickly as we pay our vendors and employees for their goods and services since a number of our receivables are contractually billable and due to us only when certain contractual milestones are achieved. Our days sales outstanding on our receivables can be impacted and can fluctuate due to contractual billing milestones under which we are unable to bill and collect certain amounts until the milestones have been satisfied. Financing increases in inventory balances is necessary to fulfill shipment requirements to meet delivery schedules of our customers. Cash from continuing operations is primarily derived from our customer contracts in progress and associated changes in working capital components.\nA summary of our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations from our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is as follows (in millions):\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 27, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur cash provided by (used in) operating activities was impacted by interest expense we paid related to our senior secured notes. We paid $32.4 million, $43.8 million, and $57.1 million in interest expense in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Cash used in operating activities in 2016 and 2015 was also negatively impacted by reduced operating income which reflected discretionary investments we have made in internally funded research and development of $13.9 million in 2016, $16.2 million in 2015 and $18.6 million in 2014, contract development costs on new platforms in our US segment, and increased SG&A expenditures primarily related to business capture pursuits in the tactical unmanned aircraft systems initiatives, as well as changes in working capital accounts.\nOur cash used in investing activities from continuing operations is summarized as follows (in millions):\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 27, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from sale of assets\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in restricted cash\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by capital expenditures in 2016, 2015, and 2014, which reflects investments we made for certain machinery, test equipment, demonstration units and company owned aircraft in our unmanned aerial systems business, and to a lesser degree, investments we made in our microwave electronic products business, and our satellite communications business. In addition, we used $5.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 to fund a strategic initial investment in a satellite signal monitoring, signal intelligence and location identification technology and product line to enhance our existing satellite communications business offering. An initial purchase price holdback of $0.9 million to provide security for potential indemnification obligations, less any indemnification claims, will be payable in July 2018, in cash or shares of common stock, at our option. In addition, an earn-out of $2.0 million, payable in cash or shares of common stock, at our option, will be payable in July 2018. As of December 25, 2016, the earn-out criteria had been achieved.\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations is summarized as follows (in millions):\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 27, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>618.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Extinguishment of long-term debt\n</td> <td>(14.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(175.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(661.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the issuance of common stock\n</td> <td>76.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash paid for contingent acquisition consideration\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowings under credit facility\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repayment under credit facility\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt issuance costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proceeds from the exercise of restricted stock units, employee stock options, and employee stock purchase plan\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(214.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 25, 2016 included $76.2 million in net proceeds from the equity offering we completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, $14.1 million of which was used to buy back and redeem approximately $14.5 million of our Notes. Net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 27, 2015 was primarily due to the repurchase of $175.0 million of our Notes and the repayment of $41.0 million outstanding on our Credit Agreement.\nCash provided by (used in) discontinued operations is summarized as follows (in millions):\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 25, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 27, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 28, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating cash flows provided by discontinued operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investing cash flows provided by (used in) discontinued operations\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>242.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe operating cash flow provided by discontinued operations for the years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 is substantially related to Herley Industries, Inc. and certain of Herley's subsidiaries. The investing cash flow provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 25, 2016 reflects the reimbursement of taxes from the Buyer of the Herley Entities received in 2016. The investing cash flow provided by discontinued operations for the year ended December 27, 2015 reflects cash provided of $243.2 million which is related to the sale of the Herley Entities, net of related transaction expenses.\n7.00% Senior Secured Notes due 2019\nIn May 2014, we refinanced our $625.0 million in outstanding principal amount 10% Notes with $625.0 million of newly issued 7% Notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 7% Notes was $618.5 million after an original issue discount of $6.5 million. We incurred debt issuance costs of $8.8 million associated with the new 7% Notes. We utilized the net proceeds from the\n7% Notes, a $41.0 million draw on our Credit Agreement discussed below, as well as cash from operations to extinguish the 10% Notes. The total reacquisition price of the 10% Notes was $661.5 million, including a $31.2 million early termination fee, the write-off of $15.5 million of unamortized issue costs, $12.9 million of unamortized premium, along with $5.3 million of additional interest while in escrow, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $39.1 million.\nWe completed the offering of the 7% Notes in a private placement conducted pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Act\u201d). On October 16, 2014, we exchanged the outstanding 7% Notes for an equal amount of new 7.00% Senior Secured Notes due in 2019 (the Notes\u201d) that had been registered under the Act. The terms of the Notes issued in the exchange offer were identical in all material respects to the terms of the 7% Notes, except the Notes issued in the exchange offer had been registered under the Act.\nThe Notes are governed by the Indenture, dated May 14, 2014 (the Indenture\u201d), among the Company, all of the Company's 100% owned domestic subsidiaries (the Subsidiary Guarantors\u201d) and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Trustee and Collateral Agent. A Subsidiary Guarantor can be released from its guarantee if (a) all of the capital stock issued by such Subsidiary Guarantor or all or substantially all of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor are sold or otherwise disposed of; (b) we designate such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (c) we exercise our legal defeasance option or our covenant defeasance option; or (d) upon satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or payment in full in cash of the principal of, premium, if any, accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe holders of the Notes have a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors, except with respect to accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts, cash, securities and general intangibles (other than intellectual property), on which the holders of the Notes have a second priority lien to the $110.0 million Credit Agreement.\nWe pay interest on the Notes semi-annually, in arrears, on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The Notes include customary covenants and events of default as well as a consolidated fixed charge ratio of 2.0:1 for the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on additional debt, liens, negative pledges, investments, dividends, stock repurchases, asset sales and affiliate transactions. Events of default include, among other events, non-performance of covenants, breach of representations, cross-default to other material debt, bankruptcy, insolvency, material judgments and changes in control. As of December 25, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture governing the Notes.\nWe may redeem some or all of the Notes at 105.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes through May 15, 2017, 102.625% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes if redeemed on or after May 16, 2017 but on or before May 15, 2018 and 100% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes if redeemed on or after May 16, 2018, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.\nThe terms of the Indenture require that the net cash proceeds from asset dispositions be either utilized to (i) repay or prepay amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement unless such amounts are reinvested in similar collateral, (ii) make an investment in assets that replace the collateral of the Notes or (iii) a combination of both (i) and (ii). To the extent there are any remaining net proceeds from the asset disposition after application of (i) and (ii), such amounts are required to be utilized to repurchase Notes at par after 360 days following the asset disposition.\nFollowing the sale of the U.S. and U.K. Electronic Products Division (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), on September 22, 2015, we repurchased $175.0 million of the Notes at par, in accordance with the Indenture and on August 21, 2015 paid down the $41.0 million outstanding on the $110.0 million Credit Agreement. The total reacquisition price of the Notes was $178.4 million including the write off of $1.8 million of unamortized issue costs, $1.4 million of unamortized discount, along with $0.2 million of legal fees, which resulted in a loss on extinguishment of $3.4 million.\nThe Company reinvested all net proceeds remaining after the repurchase of the $175.0 million of Notes in replacement collateral under the Indenture within 360 days following the asset disposition.\nDuring the quarter ended December 25, 2016, the Company repurchased and extinguished $14.5 million of the Notes outstanding which resulted in a gain of $0.4 million offset by $0.1 million of unamortized issuance cost and $0.1 million of unamortized discount resulting in a net gain of $0.2 million.\nAs of December 25, 2016, there were $435.5 million in Notes outstanding.\nOther Indebtedness\n$110.0 Million Credit Agreement\nOn May 14, 2014, we replaced the credit facility with KeyBank National Association and entered into the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement established a five-year senior secured revolving credit facility in the maximum amount of $110.0 million (subject to a potential increase of the maximum principal amount to $135.0 million, subject to the Agent's and applicable lenders' approval as described therein), consisting of a subline for letters of credit in the amount not to exceed $50.0 million, as well as a swingline loan in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed $10.0 million. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantors thereunder, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens. The Credit Agreement has a first priority lien on accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts, cash, securities and general intangibles (other than intellectual property). On all other assets, the Credit Agreement has a second priority lien junior to the lien securing the Notes.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, which include, but are not limited to, restrictions on indebtedness, liens, and investments, and limits on other various payments, as well as a financial covenant relating to a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15:1 (as modified per the Third Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, as defined and discussed below). Events of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement include, but are not limited to: failure of the Company to pay any principal of any loans in full when due and payable; failure of the Company to pay any interest on any loan or any fee or other amount payable under the Credit Agreement within three business days after the date when due and payable; failure of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants and agreements, subject to applicable grace periods and/or notice requirements; any representation, warranty or statement made in or pursuant to the Credit Agreement or any related writing or any other material information furnished by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the Agent or the lenders proving to be false or erroneous; and the occurrence of an event or condition having or reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, which includes a material adverse effect on the business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company or the ability of the Company to repay its obligations. Where an event of default arises from certain bankruptcy events, the commitments will automatically and immediately terminate and the principal of, and interest then outstanding on, all of the loans will become immediately due and payable. Subject to certain notice requirements and other conditions, upon the occurrence of an event of default, including the occurrence of a condition having or reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, commitments may be terminated and the principal of, and interest then outstanding on, all of the loans may become immediately due and payable. As of December 25, 2016, no event of default had occurred and the Company believes that events or conditions having a material adverse effect, giving rise to an acceleration of any amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement, have not occurred and the likelihood of such events or conditions occurring is remote.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement may take the form of a base rate revolving loan, Eurodollar revolving loan or swingline loan. Base rate revolving loans and swingline loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the applicable margin from time to time in effect plus the highest of (i) the Agent's prime lending rate, as in effect at such time, (ii) the federal funds rate, as in effect at such time, plus 0.50% per annum, and (iii) the adjusted London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) determined at such time for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00% per annum. Eurodollar revolving loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the applicable margin from time to time in effect plus the adjusted LIBOR rate. The applicable margin varies between 1.50% - 2.00% for base rate revolving loans and swingline loans and 2.50% - 3.00% for Eurodollar loans, and is based on several factors including our then-existing borrowing base and the lender's total commitment amount and revolving credit exposure. The calculation of our borrowing base takes into account several items relating to us and our subsidiaries, including amounts due and owing under billed and unbilled accounts receivables, then-held eligible raw materials inventory, work-in-process inventory, and applicable reserves.\nOn May 31, 2015, we entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. Under the terms of the Third Amendment, the definitions of certain terms of the Credit Agreement were modified, the disposition of the Herley Entities was approved by the lenders, a minimum $175.0 million repurchase of the Notes by the Company was required, and the payment in full of the outstanding balance of the Credit Agreement was required. Additionally, the measurement of the fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15:1 was modified as follows: (i) the fixed charge coverage ratio will not be measured as of the end of any quarterly reporting period ending on or about June 30, 2015, or as of the end of any quarterly reporting period ending after June 30, 2015, if on such date (a) there are no outstanding revolving loans or swingline loans and (b) the aggregate amount outstanding under letters of credit is less than or equal to $17.0 million, and (ii) as to any subsequent quarterly reporting period ending after June 30, 2015, and not covered by (i) above, a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.05:1 must be maintained if the percentage of (a) outstanding revolving loans plus the sum of the outstanding swingline loans and outstanding letters of credit that are in excess of $17.0 million, to (b) the revolving credit commitment, minus the Herley Disposition Proceeds Reinvestment Reserve, as defined below, is greater than 0.00% but less than 15.00% or a fixed charge\ncoverage ratio of at least 1.10:1 must be maintained if the aforementioned percentage is equal to or greater than 15.00% but less than 25.00%. In all other instances, a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15:1 must be maintained. For purposes of computing the fixed charge coverage ratio, the associated reduction in consolidated interest expense in connection with the repurchase of Notes with proceeds from the sale of the Herley Entities shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day of the most recently completed four quarterly reporting periods prior to the sale.\nThe terms of the Third Amendment also included the establishment of a reserve (the Herley Disposition Proceeds Reinvestment Reserve\u201d) that reduced the maximum $110.0 million total borrowing base on the Credit Agreement. With the sale of the Herley Entities, a $50.8 million reserve was established based upon the collateral carrying value under the Credit Agreement of the Herley Entities disposed. The reserve and therefore the maximum borrowing base were adjusted monthly for the subsequent cumulative reinvestment in similar collateral assets over a period not to have exceeded 360 days from the date of sale of the Herley Entities. As of September 25, 2016, there was no reserve on the maximum borrowings, resulting from a cumulative reinvestment in similar collateral assets since the sale of the Herley Entities in excess of the $50.8 million reserve established at the date of the sale of the Herley Entities. We made investments in assets that replaced the collateral, which reinstated the maximum facility to the full $110.0 million as of the end of the first quarter of 2016.\nOn August 19, 2015, we entered into a fourth amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Fourth Amendment provides for a modification of the Third Amendment as it relates to when the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio will be measured based upon outstanding borrowings. Outstanding borrowings for purposes of computing the applicable minimum fixed charge coverage ratio exclude any letter of credit exposure outstanding of $17.0 million plus the amount of letters of credit outstanding for the divested Herley Entities for which a cash deposit was placed in escrow by the Buyer to cover the amount of such outstanding letters of credit, should the letters of credit be pulled.\nAs of December 25, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding on the Credit Agreement and $11.1 million was outstanding on letters of credit, resulting in net borrowing base availability of $56.0 million. We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of December 25, 2016.\nDebt Acquired in Acquisition of Herley\nWe assumed a $10.0 million ten-year term loan with a bank in Israel that Herley entered into on September 16, 2008 in connection with the acquisition of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. The balance as of December 25, 2016 was $1.8 million, and the loan is payable in quarterly installments of $0.3 million plus interest at LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5%. The loan agreement contains various covenants including a minimum net equity covenant as defined in the loan agreement. We were in compliance with the financial covenants of the loan agreement as of December 25, 2016.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K, Item 303(a)(4)(ii).\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at December 25, 2016, and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in millions):\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due/forecast by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018 - 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020 - 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022 and After\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt, net of interest(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>436.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated interest on debt(2)\n</td> <td>76.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase orders(3)\n</td> <td>139.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(4)\n</td> <td>67.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties(5)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commitments and recorded liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>720.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>535.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The Notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of $435.5 million are due May 15, 2019.

Our letters of credit are primarily related to milestone payments received from foreign customers for which the customer has not yet received the product. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at December 25, 2016 is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report, specifically Note 14.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nWe intend to fund our cash requirements with cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from our recent equity offering and borrowings under the Credit Agreement. We believe these sources should be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. As discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d contained within this Annual Report, our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and may vary in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are external to our control. If the conditions in our industry deteriorate or our customers cancel or postpone projects or if we are unable to sufficiently increase our revenues or further reduce our expenses, we may experience, in the future, a significant long-term negative impact to our financial results and cash flows from operations. In such a situation, we could fall out of compliance with our financial and other covenants which, if not waived, could limit our liquidity and capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Principles and Estimates\nWe have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, stockholders' equity, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On a periodic basis, as deemed necessary, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory including the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, valuation of long-lived assets including identifiable intangibles and goodwill, accounting for income taxes including the related valuation allowance, warranties, contingencies and litigation, contingent acquisition consideration, stock-based compensation, and losses on unused office space. We explain these accounting policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences may be material.\nRevenue recognition. We generate our revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements: cost-plus-fee contracts, time-and-materials contracts, and fixed-price contracts. Revenue on cost-plus-fee contracts is recognized to the extent of allowable costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned. We consider fixed fees under cost-plus-fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract. We recognize the relevant portion of the expected fee to be awarded by the customer at the time such fee can be reasonably estimated, based on factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance, including any interim performance evaluations rendered by the customer. Revenue on time-and-materials contracts is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered for services provided, to the extent of material cost for products delivered to customers, and to the extent of expenses incurred on behalf of the customers.\nWe have three basic categories of fixed-price contracts: fixed unit price, fixed-price level of effort, and fixed-price completion. Revenue recognition methods on fixed-price contracts will vary depending on the nature of the work and the contract terms. Revenues on fixed-price service contracts are recorded as work is performed in accordance with Topic 605. Topic 605 generally requires revenue to be deferred until all of the following have occurred: (1) there is a contract in place, (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided, (3) the price is fixed or determinable, and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues on fixed-price contracts that require delivery of specific items may be recorded based on a price per unit as units are delivered. Revenue for fixed-price contracts in which we are paid a specific amount to provide services for a stated period of time is recognized ratably over the service period.\nA portion of our fixed-price completion contracts are within the scope of Topic 605. For these contracts, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs to complete the contract. Estimates of costs to complete include material, direct labor, overhead, and allowable indirect expenses for our government contracts. These cost estimates are reviewed and, if necessary, revised monthly on a contract-by-contract basis. If, as a result of this review, we determine that a loss on a contract is probable, then the full amount of estimated loss is charged to operations in the period it is determined that it is probable a loss will be realized from the full performance of the contract.\nIn accounting for our long-term contracts for production of products provided to the U.S. Government, we utilize both cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting under the provisions of Topic 605. Under the units delivered measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, sales are recognized as the units are accepted by the customer generally using sales values for units in accordance with the contract terms. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on units delivered or as computed on the basis of the estimated final average unit costs plus profit. We classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending upon the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. Significant management judgments and estimates, including but not limited to the estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. A cancellation, schedule delay, or modification of a fixed-price contract that is accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method may adversely affect our gross margins for the period in which the contract is modified or canceled. Under certain circumstances, a cancellation or negative modification could result in us having to reverse revenue that we recognized in a prior period, thus significantly reducing the amount of revenues we recognize for the period in which the adjustment is made. Correspondingly, a positive modification may positively affect our gross margins. In addition, a schedule delay or modifications can result in an increase in estimated cost to complete the project, which would also result in an impact to our gross margin. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nIt is our policy to review any arrangement containing software or software deliverables and services against the criteria contained in FASB ASC Topic 985, Software ( Topic 985\u201d) and related technical practice aids. Under the provisions of Topic 985, we review the contract value of software deliverables and services and determine allocations of the contract value based on Vendor Specific Objective Evidence ( VSOE\u201d). All software arrangements requiring significant production, modification, or customization of the software are accounted for in conformity with Topic 605.\nOur contracts may include the provision of more than one of our services ( multiple element arrangements\u201d). In these situations, we apply the guidance of Topic 605. Accordingly, for applicable arrangements, revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values, with proper consideration given to the guidance provided by other authoritative literature.\nFor multiple element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware products' functionality and undelivered non-software services, we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) VSOE, (ii) third-party evidence of selling price ( TPE\u201d), and (iii) best estimate of the selling price ( ESP\u201d).\nVSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our offerings contain significant differentiation such that comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products' selling prices are on a stand-alone basis. Therefore, we typically are not able to obtain TPE of selling price. ESP reflects our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. We determine ESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive\nlandscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. The determination of ESP is made through consultation with our management, taking into consideration our marketing strategy.\nWe account for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software-related products, including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance. For such transactions, revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element, and fair value is determined by VSOE. If we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements, we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements. Under certain of our contractual arrangements, we may also recognize revenue for out-of-pocket expenses in accordance with Topic 605. Depending on the contractual arrangement, these expenses may be reimbursed with or without a fee.\nUnder certain of our contracts, we provide supplier procurement services and materials for our customers. We record revenue on these arrangements on a gross or net basis in accordance with Topic 605. Depending on the specific circumstances of the arrangement we consider the following criteria, among others, for recording revenue on a gross or net basis:\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>whether we act as a principal in the transaction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>whether we take title to the products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>whether we assume risks and rewards of ownership, such as risk of loss for collection, delivery or returns;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(4)\n</td> <td>whether we serve as an agent or broker, with compensation on a commission or fee basis; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5)\n</td> <td>whether we assume the credit risk for the amount billed to the customer subsequent to delivery.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor our federal contracts, we follow U.S. Government procurement and accounting standards in assessing the allowability and the allocability of costs to contracts. Due to the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. We closely monitor compliance with, and the consistent application of, our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Business operations personnel conduct periodic contract status and performance reviews. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required, any significant changes from prior estimates are included in earnings in the current period. Also, regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost, scheduling and technical matters are performed by management personnel who are independent from the business operations personnel performing work under the contract. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are scrutinized for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel, and are subject to audit by the DCAA.\nFrom time to time, we may proceed with work based on customer direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a formal review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. We base our estimates on previous experiences with the customer, communications with the customer regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of certain customers to make required future payments on amounts due to us. Management determines the adequacy of this allowance by periodically evaluating the aging and past due nature of individual customer accounts receivable balances and considering the customer's current financial situation as well as the existing industry economic conditions and other relevant factors that would be useful towards assessing the risk of collectability. If the future financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make specific required payments, additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required. In addition, if the financial condition of our customers improves and collections of amounts outstanding commence or are reasonably assured, then we may reverse previously established allowances for doubtful accounts. Changes to estimates of contract value are recorded as adjustments to revenue and not as a component of the allowance for doubtful accounts. We write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts.\nLong-lived and Intangible Assets. We account for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment ( Topic 360\u201d). Topic 360 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by\ncomparing the carrying amount of an asset to the expected future net cash flows generated by the asset. If it is determined that the asset may not be recoverable and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference. Topic 360 requires companies to separately report discontinued operations, including components of an entity that either have been disposed of (by sale, abandonment or in a distribution to owners) or classified as held for sale. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nIn accordance with Topic 360, we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include the following:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant negative industry or economic trends;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our market capitalization relative to net book value.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we determined that the carrying value of intangibles and long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we would record an impairment equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nGoodwill and Purchased Intangibles. The purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time, which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates.\nWe have established certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions. These accruals and subsequent adjustments have been recorded during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions. The accruals were determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and, in most cases, involve a significant degree of judgment. Management has recorded these accruals in accordance with its interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements, known facts, and an estimation of probable future events based on management's experience. Any changes to recorded estimates will be recognized through earnings.\nWe perform our impairment test for goodwill in accordance with Topic 350. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assessing whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics.\nKGS has four operating segments: Defense Rocket Support Services ( DRSS\u201d), Microwave Electronics Division ( ME\u201d), Technical and Training Solutions ( TTS\u201d), and Modular Systems ( MS\u201d) that provide technology based defense solutions, involving products and services, primarily for mission critical U.S. National Security priorities, with the primary focus relating to the nation's Command, Control, Communications, Computing, Combat Systems, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance requirements. The PSS operating segment provides integrated solutions for advanced homeland security, public safety, critical infrastructure security, and security and surveillance systems for government, industrial and commercial customers. The US reportable segment provides unmanned aerial systems and unmanned ground and seaborne systems. The Company has identified its reporting units to be the DRSS, ME, TTS, and MS operating segments, within its KGS reportable segment, the US reportable segment, and the PSS reportable segment to be tested for potential impairment in its fiscal year 2016 annual test.\nWe also perform impairment tests for goodwill whenever evidence of potential impairment exists. When it is determined that impairment has occurred, a charge to operations is recorded. In order to test for potential impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a comparison and weighting of the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) method and the market approach, which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based upon comparable market prices and recent transactions and also validates the reasonableness of the implied multiples from the income approach. We reconcile the fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization on the last business day of fiscal October and assume a control premium.\nIn testing for impairment of our goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal growth rates, appropriate discount rates, market multiples, and the control premium a controlling shareholder could be expected to pay:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent forecasts and other estimates. Our historical growth rates and operating results are not indicative of our projected growth rates and operating results as a consequence of our acquisitions and divestitures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The terminal growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We use estimates of market participant weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units' future expected cash flows. The significant assumptions within our WACC are: (a) equity risk premium, (b) beta, (c) size premium adjustments, (d) cost of debt and (e) capital structure assumptions. In addition, we use a company specific risk adjustment which is a subjective adjustment that, by its very nature does not include market related data, but instead examines the prospects of the reporting unit relative to the broader industry to determine if there are specific factors which may make it more risky\u201d relative to the industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recent historical market multiples are used to estimate future market pricing.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We use an estimated control premium in reconciling the aggregate value of our reporting units to our market capitalization. As discussed in Topic 350, control premiums may effectively cause a company's aggregate fair value of its reporting unit(s) to exceed its current market capitalization due to the ability of a controlling shareholder to benefit from synergies and other intangible assets that arise from such control. As a result, the measurement of fair value of an entity with a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together to produce cash flows is different from the fair value measurement of that entity's individual securities, hence, the reason a control premium is paid.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe review intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses, where identified, are determined as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the long-lived asset. We assess the recoverability of the carrying value of assets held for use based on a review of projected undiscounted cash flows.\nThe goodwill of the PSS, US, and KGS reportable segments are $35.6 million, $97.3 million and $352.5 million, respectively, at December 25, 2016.\nIn determining the fair value of our reporting units, there are key assumptions related to our future operating performance and revenue growth. If the actual operating performance and financial results are not consistent with our assumptions an impairment in our $485.4 million goodwill and $32.6 million long-lived intangibles could occur in future periods. In particular, the US reporting unit fair value includes assumptions that the development of the high performance Unmanned Combat Aerial System ( UCAS\u201d) product is successful and we are awarded future contracts for the UCAS product and other new tactical unmanned aircraft systems. Additionally, the US reporting unit fair value assumes that the U.S. Navy will exercise options under the existing current contract and we will commence low rate initial production for the Sub-Sonic Aerial Target. For certain of our reporting units, the fair value includes assumptions of the entry to new international markets for which we have not yet penetrated. Additional risks for goodwill across all reporting units include, but are not limited to, the risks discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d contained within this Annual Report and:\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, if we determine the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value below the carrying value of our reporting units;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a decrease in available government funding, including budgetary constraints affecting U.S. Government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>changes in U.S. Government programs or requirements, including the increased use of small business providers;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our failure to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted value of our reporting units;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>volatility in equity and debt markets resulting in higher discount rates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>market and political factors that could impact the success of new products, especially related to new unmanned systems platforms.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is not possible at this time to determine if an impairment charge would result from these factors, or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. We will continue to monitor our goodwill for potential impairment indicators.\nAccounting for income taxes and tax contingencies. FASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes ( Topic 740\u201d) provides the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Topic 740 also provides guidance on derecognizing, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nAs part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. This process involves estimating our actual current tax expense in conjunction with the evaluation and measurement of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes. These temporary differences result in the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded on a net basis and included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess on a periodic basis the probability that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered and therefore realized from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is established to address such risk resulting in an additional related provision for income taxes during the period.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax contingencies, unrecognized tax benefits, and any required valuation allowance, including taking into consideration the probability of the tax contingencies being incurred. Management assesses this probability based upon information provided to us by our tax advisers, our legal advisers and similar tax cases. If at a later time our assessment of the probability of these tax contingencies changes, our accrual for such tax uncertainties may increase or decrease.\nWe have a valuation allowance at December 25, 2016 due to management's overall assessment of risks and uncertainties related to our future ability to realize and, hence, utilize certain deferred tax assets, primarily consisting of net operating losses, carry forward temporary differences and future tax deductions resulting from certain types of stock option exercises, before they expire.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate at December 25, 2016 for annual and interim reporting periods could be impacted if uncertain tax positions that are not recognized at December 25, 2016 are settled at an amount which differs from our estimate. Finally, during 2016 and thereafter, if we are impacted by a change in the valuation allowance as of December 25, 2016 resulting from a change in judgment regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets beyond December 25, 2016, such effect will be recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs.\nContingencies and litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. We estimate a range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss and no amount in the range is more likely than any other number in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450 Contingencies. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. See Item 3 Legal Proceedings\u201d contained within this Annual Report for additional information.\nStock-based Compensation. We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation ( Topic 718\u201d), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values.\nThe valuation provisions of Topic 718 apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or canceled. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model and a lattice options pricing model for market condition options to estimate the fair value of our stock options at the grant date. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The lattice options pricing model breaks down the time to expiration into potentially a very large number of time intervals, or steps which makes it possible to check at every point in an option's life for the possibility of early exercise. Our employee stock options are generally subject to vesting restrictions and are generally not transferable.\nValuing options requires highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, the expected life of an option and the number of awards ultimately expected to vest. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates of an option. Furthermore, the estimated fair value of an option does not necessarily represent the value that will ultimately be realized by an employee. We used historical data to estimate the expected forfeiture rate, intrinsic and historical data to estimate the expected price volatility, and a weighted-average expected life\nformula to estimate the expected option life. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option.\nEstimates of stock-based compensation expenses are significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements, but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us. For this reason, and because we do not view stock-based compensation to be significant as related to our operational performance, we exclude estimated stock-based compensation expense when evaluating the business performance of our operating segments.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "This report describes the management's discussion and analysis of Kratos' financial performance.

Kratos is a leading technology, intellectual property and proprietary product and solution company focused on the U.S. and its allies' national security. Kratos' primary focus areas are unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security/warfare, missile defense and combat systems. We believe that our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products and designed-in positions on our customers' platforms and systems is a competitive advantage and high barrier to entry into our markets. Our work force is primarily technically oriented and highly skilled with a significant number holding national security clearances. Our entire organization is focused on executing our strategy of becoming the leading technology and intellectual property based company in our industry.\nOur primary end customers are U.S. Government agencies, including the DoD, classified agencies, intelligence agencies, other national security agencies and homeland security related agencies. We also conduct business with local, state and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated 60%, 61% and 57%, respectively, of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government (including all branches of the U.S. military), either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We believe our stable customer base, strong customer relationships, intellectual property, specialized and differentiated products, broad array of contract vehicles, designed in\u201d positions on strategic national security platforms, our targeted investments in strategic growth areas, large employee base possessing specialized skills, security clearances, specialized manufacturing facilities and equipment, extensive list of past performance qualifications, and significant management and operational capabilities position us for success.\nWe were incorporated in the state of New York on December 19, 1994 and began operations in March 1995. We reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1998.\nIndustry Background\nFaced with significant budget pressures, in recent years the U.S. Government has implemented reductions in government spending, including reductions in appropriations for the DoD and other federal agencies, pursuant to the BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a sequestration went into effect in March 2013 resulting in a 7.8% reduction to the DoD budget for FY 2013 to $495.5 billion, excluding funding for military personnel. The DoD budget was approximately $496.0 billion in FY 2014 and remained at a similar level in FY 2015. The DoD base budget excludes funding for overseas contingency operations, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which are appropriated separately and are not currently subject to the BCA.\nOn November 2, 2015, Barack Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, formalizing the terms of a two year budget agreement which raised the U.S. debt ceiling and lifted the sequestration spending caps by $80.0 billion. Under the budget agreement, the total federal spending increase over the BCA topline funding caps was $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, with the amounts divided equally between defense and domestic priorities. The overall discretionary budget was set at $1.067 trillion in FY 2016 and $1.07 trillion in FY 2017. The FY 2016 discretionary defense budget was $548.1 billion, a $25.0 billion increase over the BCA topline funding caps.\nUnder the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Obama Administration received $33.0 billion of the $38.0 billion national defense spending increase it sought in FY 2016. In summary the budget agreement:\n \u2022 extended the BCA out to 2025; \n \u2022 suspended the U.S. debt limit/ceiling until March 2017; \n \u2022 increased spending caps for FY 2016 and FY 2017 by $80.0 billion, including $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, split evenly between defense and domestic priorities; and \n \u2022 included a FY 2016 DoD base budget of $548.0 billion and a FY 2016 overseas contingency operation budget of $59.0 billion. \nOn December 18, 2015, Congress passed and Mr. Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provided funding for the U.S. Government for FY 2016, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through September 2016. Mr. Obama signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016, and provides funding for the U.S. Government at FY 2016 levels through April 28, 2017.\nCurrent Reporting Segments\nThe Company operates in three reportable segments. The KGS reportable segment is comprised of an aggregation of KGS operating segments, including our microwave electronic products, satellite communications, modular systems and rocket support operating segments. The US reportable segment consists of our unmanned aerial system and unmanned ground and seaborne system businesses. The PSS reportable segment provides independent integrated solutions for advanced homeland security, public safety, critical infrastructure, and security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications. We organize our business segments based primarily on the nature of the products, solutions and services offered. For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. From a customer and solutions perspective, we view our business as an integrated whole, leveraging skills and assets wherever possible.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn August 21, 2015, the Company completed the sale of the U.S. and U.K. operations of its Electronic Products Division to Ultra Electronics Holdings plc ( Ultra\u201d), a public limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales and traded on the London Stock Exchange, and Ultra Electronics Defense Inc. (the Buyer\u201d), a Delaware corporation ultimately owned by Ultra (the Transaction\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated May 31, 2015, by and among the Company, Ultra and the Buyer, the Company sold to the Buyer all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiary Herley Industries, Inc. ( Herley\u201d) and certain of Herley's subsidiaries, including Herley-CTI, Inc., EW Simulation Technology, Ltd. and Stapor Research, Inc. (collectively, the Herley Entities\u201d), for $260.0 million and $5.0 million for taxes incurred as part of the Transaction, less a $2.0 million escrow to satisfy any purchase price adjustments and a working capital adjustment of approximately $8.3 million.\nIn November 2015, the Company and Ultra settled the working capital adjustment at $8.1 million, and the net cash position at closing, resulting in a net payment to the Company of $2.7 million. This represents the payment from escrow to the Company of $2.0 million, as well as the payment from Ultra of $0.7 million, reflecting the difference in the estimated working\ncapital and actual working capital and the net cash position at the close of the Transaction. In December 2015, the Company submitted to Ultra for reimbursement the maximum $5.0 million for taxes incurred as part of the Transaction, which was reimbursed in January 2016. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKey Financial Statement Concepts\nAs of December 25, 2016, we consider the following factors to be important in understanding our financial statements.\nKGS' and US' business with the U.S. Government and prime contractors is generally performed under fixed-price, cost reimbursable, or time and materials contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts for the U.S. Government provide for reimbursement of costs plus the payment of a fee. Some cost reimbursable contracts include incentive fees that are awarded based on performance on the contract. Under time and materials contracts, we are reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and reimbursed for travel and other direct expenses at actual costs plus applied general and administrative expenses. In accounting for our long-term contracts for production of products and services provided to the U.S. Government and provided to our PSS segment customers under fixed-price contracts, we utilize both cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under the units delivered measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, sales are recognized as the units are accepted by the customer generally using sales values for units in accordance with the contract terms. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries or as computed on the basis of the estimated final average unit costs plus profit. We classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending upon the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.\nWe consider the following factors when determining if collection of a receivable is reasonably assured: comprehensive collection history; results of our communications with customers; the current financial position of the customer; and the relevant economic conditions in the customer's country. If we have had no prior experience with the customer, we may review reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors in a reliable and effective manner. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and adversely affect their financial ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Additionally, on certain contracts whereby we perform services for a prime/general contractor, a specified percentage of the invoiced trade accounts receivable may be retained by the customer until we complete the project. We periodically review all retainages for collectability and record allowances for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate, based on our assessment of the associated risks.\nWe monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are routinely audited by the DCAA.\nWe manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations with consideration given to our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates discussed below. Due to the Federal Acquisition Regulation rules that govern our business, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as cost of sales or general and administrative costs) as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, and operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income. Changes in contract estimates are reviewed on a contract-by-contract basis and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision in accordance with GAAP. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete the project, which determine the project's percentage complete, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the Year Ended December 25, 2016 to the Year ended December 27, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues by reportable segment for the years ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015 are as follows (in millions):\n\nRevenues increased $11.6 million to $668.7 million in 2016 from $657.1 million in 2015. The increase in revenues was the result of increased revenues of $19.7 million in our KGS segment primarily resulting from increased shipments and work performed in our satellite communications business of approximately $21.1 million, our simulation and training business of approximately $6.7 million and our ballistic missile target businesses of approximately $8.6 million, offset by a reduction in shipments of our specialized ground equipment products resulting primarily from delays in contract awards of $11.8 million and other reductions primarily in our government services business, which includes our weapons reset business, of approximately $4.9 million. Increased revenues of $9.5 million in our US segment resulted from recent contract awards in unmanned combat aerial systems and unmanned aerial target systems as well as an increase in shipments of unmanned aerial target systems. Declines in our PSS segment of $17.6 million were primarily the result of our change in strategic direction in the fourth quarter of 2014 to capture higher margin work and only selectively bid on larger security integration projects that traditionally generate lower margins, coupled with the impact of approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth recorded during 2016 which negatively impacted our revenues. This unexpected cost growth is primarily related to several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion in 2017.\nProduct sales increased $17.7 million to $320.6 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $302.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, primarily as a result of the increase in product shipments due to the factors discussed above in our KGS and US segments. As a percentage of total revenue, product revenues were 47.9% for the year ended December 25, 2016 as compared to 46.1% for the year ended December 27, 2015. Service revenues decreased by $6.1 million to $348.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $354.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the change in strategic direction and the completion of larger security installation projects in our PSS segment, offset partially by increases in our KGS segment as discussed above.\nAs described in our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates\u201d below and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report, we utilize both the cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue as provided for in Topic 605. When revenue is calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, total costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated costs to complete the contract. These estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract basis, and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete projects, which determine the project's percentage of completion, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates. During the reporting periods contained herein, we did experience revenue and margin adjustments on certain projects based on the aforementioned factors, but the effect of such adjustments, both positive and negative, when evaluated in total were determined to be immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $515.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $495.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The $19.8 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily a result of increased revenue discussed above, as well as an $18.7 million loss accrual recorded in 2016 on the LCASD cost share contract, which is expected to be incurred by the Company over the period of performance of the contract, and was incurred in order to retain the intellectual property rights for the new LCASD platform. Cost of revenues was also impacted by approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth on PSS projects recorded during 2016 which negatively impacted our revenues. This unexpected cost growth is primarily related to several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion in 2017.\nGross margin percentage decreased to 23.0% for the year ended December 25, 2016 compared to 24.6% for the year ended December 27, 2015. Margins on services increased to 26.5% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 24.8% for the year ended December 27, 2015, due primarily to a more favorable mix of revenues. Margins on product sales decreased for the year ended December 25, 2016 as compared to December 27, 2015 to 19.1% from 24.5%, respectively, primarily as a result of a change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the KGS segment increased to 26.3% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 25.4% for the year ended December 27, 2015, primarily as a result of change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the US segment decreased to (2.9)% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 16.3% for the year ended December 27, 2015, reflecting an $18.7 million loss accrual recorded on the LCASD cost share contract, which is expected to be incurred by the Company over the period of performance of the contract, and was incurred in order to retain the intellectual property rights for the new LCASD platform. Margins in the PSS segment increased slightly to 26.1% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 26.0% for the year ended December 27, 2015 as a result of a more favorable mix of revenues, resulting from the strategic shift in focus on smaller sized, higher margin projects and only selectively bidding on larger sized lower margin projects, the completion of certain lower margin projects, as well as the impact of cost reduction actions that were taken during the year ended December 25, 2016, offset partially by the impact of approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth recorded during 2016 on several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). SG&A decreased $4.4 million to $146.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $150.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a $2.5 million reduction of amortization of intangibles in 2016, as a result of certain intangible assets being fully amortized, as well as cost reduction actions taken by the Company, offset partially by increased discretionary investments to pursue business opportunities in the unmanned tactical aircraft market. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 21.9% for fiscal 2016 from 22.9% for fiscal 2015. Excluding amortization of intangibles of $10.5 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 and amortization of intangibles of $13.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, SG&A decreased as a percentage of revenues to 20.3% from 21.0% for the year ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively, due primarily to the cost reduction actions the Company has taken and the increased leverage on the Company's public company infrastructure costs as revenues expand.\nInternal research and development (IR&D) expenses. IR&D expenses decreased to $13.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, IR&D decreased to 2.1% of revenues for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 2.5% of revenues for the year ended December 27, 2015. IR&D expenditures are primarily related to investments we are making in conjunction with our customers and prospective customers, with the objectives of the Company's products being the new platform for or designed in\u201d to certain new long term program opportunities and the Company owning certain intellectual property rights for products that support these programs primarily in our unmanned systems and microwave electronic businesses as well as technology upgrades and refresh activities that are necessary for the next generation of our existing product lines primarily in our satellite communications business.\nMerger and acquisition related items. Merger and acquisition related items increased to $1.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $0.1 million in the year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily as a result of a $1.9 million charge related to the settlement of a contract dispute in our PSS business during the first quarter of 2016.\nUnused office space and other restructuring. The expense of $10.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 was due to a $9.2 million charge that was recorded in the Company's modular systems business as a result of the closure of one of its manufacturing facilities, as well as, the exit from certain lower margin product business lines and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken in the first quarter of 2016. The restructuring charge recorded in our modular systems business was comprised of $4.9 million related to fixed and intangible assets, of which $1.4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting the write-down to estimated fair value of one of its facilities, $3.0 million related to exited product lines and $1.3 million related to excess facilities. The benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 was due to a reduction in the liability for unused office space at our Columbia, Maryland facility resulting from the execution of a recent sublease arrangement, partially offset by an impairment of leasehold improvements, office furniture and equipment at that location, and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken during the year.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net decreased to $33.7 million from $40.1 million for the years ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively. The decrease in expense of $6.4 million was primarily related to a $3.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the 10% Notes in the third quarter of 2015, a reduction in interest expense of $1.3 million as a result of the redemption of $175.0 million of our Notes and the repayment of $41.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement in the third quarter of 2015 which both occurred as a result of our divestiture of the Herley Entities.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations. The provision for income taxes from continuing operations changed to an expense of $8.1 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $52.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from a benefit of $11.4 million on a loss of $44.6 million from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 27, 2015. The expense for the year ended December 25, 2016 was primarily comprised of a provision for foreign and state taxes increased by the change in the indefinite life deferred tax liability. The benefit for the year ended December 27, 2015 was primarily due to the intra-period allocation rules in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Intra-period allocation rules require the Company to allocate its provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations. In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations, the Company must allocate the tax provision to other categories of earnings. A related tax benefit is then recorded in continuing operations. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our income taxes.\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations. There was no significant activity for the year ended December 25, 2016. The loss from discontinued operations was $0.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016, compared to income of $53.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, which included the gain on sale of the Herley Entities of $80.8 million which occurred on August 21, 2015. The income for the year ended December 27, 2015 also reflects interest expense allocated to discontinued operations of $9.1 million. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComparison of Results for the Year Ended December 27, 2015 to the Year ended December 28, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues by reportable segment for the years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 are as follows (in millions):\n\nRevenues decreased $105.9 million to $657.1 million in 2015 from $763.0 million in 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to our PSS business due in part to a one-time shipment of sophisticated communication equipment of $13.0 million that occurred in the second quarter of 2014, as well as due to the completion or wind-down of certain security installation projects and due to the Company's change in strategic direction in the fourth quarter of 2014 to capture higher margin work and only selectively bid on larger security integration projects that traditionally generate lower margins, resulting in aggregate reduced service revenues in the PSS segment of $38.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. In addition,\nfor the year ended December 27, 2015, KGS segment revenue decreased by $39.0 million due primarily to reduced shipments of our specialized ground equipment products of $38.6 million, delays in orders and awards as a result of the challenging federal government and DoD funding environment, and continued reduction in our legacy government services business of $14.7 million, which includes reset work on legacy weapons systems, all of which adversely impacted the timing of new contract awards, bookings and our revenues, offset partially by growth in our simulation and training business and in technical government services where we support directed energy weapons and electromagnetic railgun efforts, which aggregated a net increase of $16.4 million. Revenues in our US segment decreased by $15.2 million primarily as a result of a reduction in shipments of certain of our aerial target products due to delays in the timing of follow-on and new international contract awards.\nProduct sales decreased $69.3 million to $302.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $372.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2014, primarily as a result of the decline in product shipments due to the factors discussed above in our KGS, PSS and US segments. As a percentage of total revenue, product revenues were 46.1% for the year ended December 27, 2015 as compared to 48.8% for the year ended December 28, 2014. Service revenues decreased by $36.6 million to $354.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $390.8 million for the year ended December 28, 2014. The decrease was primarily related to the change in strategic direction and the completion of larger security installation projects in our PSS segment as well as the continued reduction in our legacy government services business as discussed above.\nAs described in our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates\u201d below and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report, we utilize both the cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue as provided for in Topic 605. When revenue is calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, total costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated costs to complete the contract. These estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract basis, and are revised periodically", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ substantially from those expressed in or implied by any forward-looking statements herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties described in this Item 7, in Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report. These forward-looking statements reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date such forward-looking statements are made. Except as required by law, we assume no responsibility for updating any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report and other reports and filings made with the SEC.\nOverview\nKratos is a mid-tier government contractor at the forefront of the DoD's Third Offset Strategy. Kratos is a leading technology, intellectual property and proprietary product and solution company focused on the U.S. and its allies' national security. Kratos' primary focus areas are unmanned systems, satellite communications, microwave electronics, cyber security/warfare, missile defense and combat systems. We believe that our technology, intellectual property, proprietary products and designed-in positions on our customers' platforms and systems is a competitive advantage and high barrier to entry into our markets. Our work force is primarily technically oriented and highly skilled with a significant number holding national security clearances. Our entire organization is focused on executing our strategy of becoming the leading technology and intellectual property based company in our industry.\nOur primary end customers are U.S. Government agencies, including the DoD, classified agencies, intelligence agencies, other national security agencies and homeland security related agencies. We also conduct business with local, state and foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated 60%, 61% and 57%, respectively, of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government (including all branches of the U.S. military), either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor. We believe our stable customer base, strong customer relationships, intellectual property, specialized and differentiated products, broad array of contract vehicles, designed in\u201d positions on strategic national security platforms, our targeted investments in strategic growth areas, large employee base possessing specialized skills, security clearances, specialized manufacturing facilities and equipment, extensive list of past performance qualifications, and significant management and operational capabilities position us for success.\nWe were incorporated in the state of New York on December 19, 1994 and began operations in March 1995. We reincorporated in the state of Delaware in 1998.\nIndustry Background\nFaced with significant budget pressures, in recent years the U.S. Government has implemented reductions in government spending, including reductions in appropriations for the DoD and other federal agencies, pursuant to the BCA, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Pursuant to the terms of the BCA, a sequestration went into effect in March 2013 resulting in a 7.8% reduction to the DoD budget for FY 2013 to $495.5 billion, excluding funding for military personnel. The DoD budget was approximately $496.0 billion in FY 2014 and remained at a similar level in FY 2015. The DoD base budget excludes funding for overseas contingency operations, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, which are appropriated separately and are not currently subject to the BCA.\nOn November 2, 2015, Barack Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, formalizing the terms of a two year budget agreement which raised the U.S. debt ceiling and lifted the sequestration spending caps by $80.0 billion. Under the budget agreement, the total federal spending increase over the BCA topline funding caps was $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, with the amounts divided equally between defense and domestic priorities. The overall discretionary budget was set at $1.067 trillion in FY 2016 and $1.07 trillion in FY 2017. The FY 2016 discretionary defense budget was $548.1 billion, a $25.0 billion increase over the BCA topline funding caps.\nUnder the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, the Obama Administration received $33.0 billion of the $38.0 billion national defense spending increase it sought in FY 2016. In summary the budget agreement:\n \u2022 extended the BCA out to 2025; \n \u2022 suspended the U.S. debt limit/ceiling until March 2017; \n \u2022 increased spending caps for FY 2016 and FY 2017 by $80.0 billion, including $50.0 billion in FY 2016 and $30.0 billion in FY 2017, split evenly between defense and domestic priorities; and \n \u2022 included a FY 2016 DoD base budget of $548.0 billion and a FY 2016 overseas contingency operation budget of $59.0 billion. \nOn December 18, 2015, Congress passed and Mr. Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which provided funding for the U.S. Government for FY 2016, providing $1.1 trillion in discretionary funding for federal agencies through September 2016. Mr. Obama signed a continuing resolution in September 2016, which was extended in December 2016, and provides funding for the U.S. Government at FY 2016 levels through April 28, 2017.\nCurrent Reporting Segments\nThe Company operates in three reportable segments. The KGS reportable segment is comprised of an aggregation of KGS operating segments, including our microwave electronic products, satellite communications, modular systems and rocket support operating segments. The US reportable segment consists of our unmanned aerial system and unmanned ground and seaborne system businesses. The PSS reportable segment provides independent integrated solutions for advanced homeland security, public safety, critical infrastructure, and security and surveillance systems for government and commercial applications. We organize our business segments based primarily on the nature of the products, solutions and services offered. For additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. From a customer and solutions perspective, we view our business as an integrated whole, leveraging skills and assets wherever possible.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOn August 21, 2015, the Company completed the sale of the U.S. and U.K. operations of its Electronic Products Division to Ultra Electronics Holdings plc ( Ultra\u201d), a public limited company formed under the laws of England and Wales and traded on the London Stock Exchange, and Ultra Electronics Defense Inc. (the Buyer\u201d), a Delaware corporation ultimately owned by Ultra (the Transaction\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated May 31, 2015, by and among the Company, Ultra and the Buyer, the Company sold to the Buyer all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of its wholly owned subsidiary Herley Industries, Inc. ( Herley\u201d) and certain of Herley's subsidiaries, including Herley-CTI, Inc., EW Simulation Technology, Ltd. and Stapor Research, Inc. (collectively, the Herley Entities\u201d), for $260.0 million and $5.0 million for taxes incurred as part of the Transaction, less a $2.0 million escrow to satisfy any purchase price adjustments and a working capital adjustment of approximately $8.3 million.\nIn November 2015, the Company and Ultra settled the working capital adjustment at $8.1 million, and the net cash position at closing, resulting in a net payment to the Company of $2.7 million. This represents the payment from escrow to the Company of $2.0 million, as well as the payment from Ultra of $0.7 million, reflecting the difference in the estimated working\ncapital and actual working capital and the net cash position at the close of the Transaction. In December 2015, the Company submitted to Ultra for reimbursement the maximum $5.0 million for taxes incurred as part of the Transaction, which was reimbursed in January 2016. For additional information regarding discontinued operations, see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nKey Financial Statement Concepts\nAs of December 25, 2016, we consider the following factors to be important in understanding our financial statements.\nKGS' and US' business with the U.S. Government and prime contractors is generally performed under fixed-price, cost reimbursable, or time and materials contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts for the U.S. Government provide for reimbursement of costs plus the payment of a fee. Some cost reimbursable contracts include incentive fees that are awarded based on performance on the contract. Under time and materials contracts, we are reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and reimbursed for travel and other direct expenses at actual costs plus applied general and administrative expenses. In accounting for our long-term contracts for production of products and services provided to the U.S. Government and provided to our PSS segment customers under fixed-price contracts, we utilize both cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under the units delivered measure of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting, sales are recognized as the units are accepted by the customer generally using sales values for units in accordance with the contract terms. We estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries or as computed on the basis of the estimated final average unit costs plus profit. We classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending upon the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts.\nWe consider the following factors when determining if collection of a receivable is reasonably assured: comprehensive collection history; results of our communications with customers; the current financial position of the customer; and the relevant economic conditions in the customer's country. If we have had no prior experience with the customer, we may review reports from various credit organizations to ensure that the customer has a history of paying its creditors in a reliable and effective manner. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and adversely affect their financial ability to make payments, additional allowances would be required. Additionally, on certain contracts whereby we perform services for a prime/general contractor, a specified percentage of the invoiced trade accounts receivable may be retained by the customer until we complete the project. We periodically review all retainages for collectability and record allowances for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate, based on our assessment of the associated risks.\nWe monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to ensure consistent application under similar terms and conditions as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. Government are routinely audited by the DCAA.\nWe manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs obtained generally from government organizations with consideration given to our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates discussed below. Due to the Federal Acquisition Regulation rules that govern our business, most types of costs are allowable, and we do not focus on individual cost groupings (such as cost of sales or general and administrative costs) as much as we do on total contract costs, which are a key factor in determining contract operating income. As a result, in evaluating our operating performance, we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues, and operating income, including the effects of significant changes in operating income. Changes in contract estimates are reviewed on a contract-by-contract basis and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision in accordance with GAAP. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete the project, which determine the project's percentage complete, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Results for the Year Ended December 25, 2016 to the Year ended December 27, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues by reportable segment for the years ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kratos Government Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>244.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Kratos Government Solutions\n</td> <td>465.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>446.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Safety & Security - service revenues\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unmanned Systems - product sales\n</td> <td>75.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>348.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total product sales\n</td> <td>320.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>668.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues increased $11.6 million to $668.7 million in 2016 from $657.1 million in 2015. The increase in revenues was the result of increased revenues of $19.7 million in our KGS segment primarily resulting from increased shipments and work performed in our satellite communications business of approximately $21.1 million, our simulation and training business of approximately $6.7 million and our ballistic missile target businesses of approximately $8.6 million, offset by a reduction in shipments of our specialized ground equipment products resulting primarily from delays in contract awards of $11.8 million and other reductions primarily in our government services business, which includes our weapons reset business, of approximately $4.9 million. Increased revenues of $9.5 million in our US segment resulted from recent contract awards in unmanned combat aerial systems and unmanned aerial target systems as well as an increase in shipments of unmanned aerial target systems. Declines in our PSS segment of $17.6 million were primarily the result of our change in strategic direction in the fourth quarter of 2014 to capture higher margin work and only selectively bid on larger security integration projects that traditionally generate lower margins, coupled with the impact of approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth recorded during 2016 which negatively impacted our revenues. This unexpected cost growth is primarily related to several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion in 2017.\nProduct sales increased $17.7 million to $320.6 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $302.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, primarily as a result of the increase in product shipments due to the factors discussed above in our KGS and US segments. As a percentage of total revenue, product revenues were 47.9% for the year ended December 25, 2016 as compared to 46.1% for the year ended December 27, 2015. Service revenues decreased by $6.1 million to $348.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $354.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to the change in strategic direction and the completion of larger security installation projects in our PSS segment, offset partially by increases in our KGS segment as discussed above.\nAs described in our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates\u201d below and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report, we utilize both the cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue as provided for in Topic 605. When revenue is calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, total costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated costs to complete the contract. These estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract basis, and are revised periodically throughout the life of the contract such that adjustments to profit resulting from revisions are made cumulative to the date of the revision. Significant management judgments and estimates, including the estimated costs to complete projects, which determine the project's percentage of completion, must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates. During the reporting periods contained herein, we did experience revenue and margin adjustments on certain projects based on the aforementioned factors, but the effect of such adjustments, both positive and negative, when evaluated in total were determined to be immaterial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost of revenues. Cost of revenues increased to $515.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $495.3 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The $19.8 million increase in cost of revenues was primarily a result of increased revenue discussed above, as well as an $18.7 million loss accrual recorded in 2016 on the LCASD cost share contract, which is expected to be incurred by the Company over the period of performance of the contract, and was incurred in order to retain the intellectual property rights for the new LCASD platform. Cost of revenues was also impacted by approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth on PSS projects recorded during 2016 which negatively impacted our revenues. This unexpected cost growth is primarily related to several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion in 2017.\nGross margin percentage decreased to 23.0% for the year ended December 25, 2016 compared to 24.6% for the year ended December 27, 2015. Margins on services increased to 26.5% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 24.8% for the year ended December 27, 2015, due primarily to a more favorable mix of revenues. Margins on product sales decreased for the year ended December 25, 2016 as compared to December 27, 2015 to 19.1% from 24.5%, respectively, primarily as a result of a change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the KGS segment increased to 26.3% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 25.4% for the year ended December 27, 2015, primarily as a result of change in the mix of products sold. Margins in the US segment decreased to (2.9)% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 16.3% for the year ended December 27, 2015, reflecting an $18.7 million loss accrual recorded on the LCASD cost share contract, which is expected to be incurred by the Company over the period of performance of the contract, and was incurred in order to retain the intellectual property rights for the new LCASD platform. Margins in the PSS segment increased slightly to 26.1% for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 26.0% for the year ended December 27, 2015 as a result of a more favorable mix of revenues, resulting from the strategic shift in focus on smaller sized, higher margin projects and only selectively bidding on larger sized lower margin projects, the completion of certain lower margin projects, as well as the impact of cost reduction actions that were taken during the year ended December 25, 2016, offset partially by the impact of approximately $4.1 million in unexpected cost growth recorded during 2016 on several large long-term security integration projects which are nearing completion.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). SG&A decreased $4.4 million to $146.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $150.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a $2.5 million reduction of amortization of intangibles in 2016, as a result of certain intangible assets being fully amortized, as well as cost reduction actions taken by the Company, offset partially by increased discretionary investments to pursue business opportunities in the unmanned tactical aircraft market. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 21.9% for fiscal 2016 from 22.9% for fiscal 2015. Excluding amortization of intangibles of $10.5 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 and amortization of intangibles of $13.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, SG&A decreased as a percentage of revenues to 20.3% from 21.0% for the year ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively, due primarily to the cost reduction actions the Company has taken and the increased leverage on the Company's public company infrastructure costs as revenues expand.\nInternal research and development (IR&D) expenses. IR&D expenses decreased to $13.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $16.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. As a percentage of revenues, IR&D decreased to 2.1% of revenues for the year ended December 25, 2016 from 2.5% of revenues for the year ended December 27, 2015. IR&D expenditures are primarily related to investments we are making in conjunction with our customers and prospective customers, with the objectives of the Company's products being the new platform for or designed in\u201d to certain new long term program opportunities and the Company owning certain intellectual property rights for products that support these programs primarily in our unmanned systems and microwave electronic businesses as well as technology upgrades and refresh activities that are necessary for the next generation of our existing product lines primarily in our satellite communications business.\nMerger and acquisition related items. Merger and acquisition related items increased to $1.9 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from $0.1 million in the year ended December 27, 2015. The increase was primarily as a result of a $1.9 million charge related to the settlement of a contract dispute in our PSS business during the first quarter of 2016.\nUnused office space and other restructuring. The expense of $10.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 was due to a $9.2 million charge that was recorded in the Company's modular systems business as a result of the closure of one of its manufacturing facilities, as well as, the exit from certain lower margin product business lines and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken in the first quarter of 2016. The restructuring charge recorded in our modular systems business was comprised of $4.9 million related to fixed and intangible assets, of which $1.4 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflecting the write-down to estimated fair value of one of its facilities, $3.0 million related to exited product lines and $1.3 million related to excess facilities. The benefit of $0.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 was due to a reduction in the liability for unused office space at our Columbia, Maryland facility resulting from the execution of a recent sublease arrangement, partially offset by an impairment of leasehold improvements, office furniture and equipment at that location, and employee termination costs related to personnel reduction actions taken during the year.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net decreased to $33.7 million from $40.1 million for the years ended December 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, respectively. The decrease in expense of $6.4 million was primarily related to a $3.4 million loss on the extinguishment of the 10% Notes in the third quarter of 2015, a reduction in interest expense of $1.3 million as a result of the redemption of $175.0 million of our Notes and the repayment of $41.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement in the third quarter of 2015 which both occurred as a result of our divestiture of the Herley Entities.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes from continuing operations. The provision for income taxes from continuing operations changed to an expense of $8.1 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $52.3 million for the year ended December 25, 2016 from a benefit of $11.4 million on a loss of $44.6 million from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 27, 2015. The expense for the year ended December 25, 2016 was primarily comprised of a provision for foreign and state taxes increased by the change in the indefinite life deferred tax liability. The benefit for the year ended December 27, 2015 was primarily due to the intra-period allocation rules in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Intra-period allocation rules require the Company to allocate its provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations. In periods in which there is a pre-tax loss from continuing operations and pre-tax income in other categories of earnings, such as discontinued operations, the Company must allocate the tax provision to other categories of earnings. A related tax benefit is then recorded in continuing operations. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our income taxes.\nIncome (loss) from discontinued operations. There was no significant activity for the year ended December 25, 2016. The loss from discontinued operations was $0.1 million for the year ended December 25, 2016, compared to income of $53.0 million for the year ended December 27, 2015, which included the gain on sale of the Herley Entities of $80.8 million which occurred on August 21, 2015. The income for the year ended December 27, 2015 also reflects interest expense allocated to discontinued operations of $9.1 million. For additional information, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nComparison of Results for the Year Ended December 27, 2015 to the Year ended December 28, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues by reportable segment for the years ended December 27, 2015 and December 28, 2014 are as follows (in millions):\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kratos Government Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>207.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>236.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Kratos Government Solutions\n</td> <td>446.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Public Safety & Security\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues\n</td> <td>144.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Public Safety & Security\n</td> <td>144.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unmanned Systems - product sales\n</td> <td>66.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(105.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>390.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total product sales\n</td> <td>302.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>372.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>763.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(105.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues decreased $105.9 million to $657.1 million in 2015 from $763.0 million in 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to our PSS business due in part to a one-time shipment of sophisticated communication equipment of $13.0 million that occurred in the second quarter of 2014, as well as due to the completion or wind-down of certain security installation projects and due to the Company's change in strategic direction in the fourth quarter of 2014 to capture higher margin work and only selectively bid on larger security integration projects that traditionally generate lower margins, resulting in aggregate reduced service revenues in the PSS segment of $38.7 million for the year ended December 27, 2015. In addition,\nfor the year ended December 27, 2015, KGS segment revenue decreased by $39.0 million due primarily to reduced shipments of our specialized ground equipment products of $38.6 million, delays in orders and awards as a result of the challenging federal government and DoD funding environment, and continued reduction in our legacy government services business of $14.7 million, which includes reset work on legacy weapons systems, all of which adversely impacted the timing of new contract awards, bookings and our revenues, offset partially by growth in our simulation and training business and in technical government services where we support directed energy weapons and electromagnetic railgun efforts, which aggregated a net increase of $16.4 million. Revenues in our US segment decreased by $15.2 million primarily as a result of a reduction in shipments of certain of our aerial target products due to delays in the timing of follow-on and new international contract awards.\nProduct sales decreased $69.3 million to $302.9 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $372.2 million for the year ended December 28, 2014, primarily as a result of the decline in product shipments due to the factors discussed above in our KGS, PSS and US segments. As a percentage of total revenue, product revenues were 46.1% for the year ended December 27, 2015 as compared to 48.8% for the year ended December 28, 2014. Service revenues decreased by $36.6 million to $354.2 million for the year ended December 27, 2015 from $390.8 million for the year ended December 28, 2014. The decrease was primarily related to the change in strategic direction and the completion of larger security installation projects in our PSS segment as well as the continued reduction in our legacy government services business as discussed above.\nAs described in our Critical Accounting Principles and Estimates\u201d below and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Annual Report, we utilize both the cost-to-cost and units delivered measures under the percentage-of-completion method of accounting for recognizing revenue as provided for in Topic 605. When revenue is calculated using the percentage-of-completion method, total costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated costs to complete the contract. These estimates are reviewed monthly on a contract-by-contract basis, and are revised periodically"}
