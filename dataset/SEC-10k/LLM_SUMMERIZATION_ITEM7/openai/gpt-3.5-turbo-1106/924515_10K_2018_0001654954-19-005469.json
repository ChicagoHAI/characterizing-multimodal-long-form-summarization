    "item_7": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva\u00ae Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light.\nLuViva provides a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva improves patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1992 under the name SpectRx, Inc.,\u201d and, on February 22, 2008, changed our name to Guided Therapeutics, Inc. At the same time, we renamed our wholly owned subsidiary, InterScan, which originally had been incorporated as Guided Therapeutics.\u201d\nSince our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants.\nOur prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry. This industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants, intense competition and a high failure rate. We have experienced operating losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2018 we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $137.6 million. To date, we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts and the early stages of marketing our products. We do not have significant experience in manufacturing, marketing or selling our products. We may not be successful in growing sales for our products. Moreover, required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. Our products may not ever gain market acceptance and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. The development and commercialization of our products requires substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development.\nOur product revenues to date have been limited. In 2018, the majority of our revenues were from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables. We expect that the majority of our revenue in 2019 will be derived from revenue from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables.\nCurrent Demand for LuViva\nBased on discussions with our distributors, we expect to generate purchase orders for approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million in LuViva devices and disposables in 2019 and expect those purchase orders to result in actual sales of $0.5 to $1.0 million in 2019, representing what we view as current demand for our products. We cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of these additional purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products.\nRecent Developments\nOn December 18, 2018, we entered into a co-development agreement with Newmars Technologies, Inc. ( NTI\u201d), whereby NTI will perform final assembly of the LuViva device for its contracted distribution countries in Eastern Europe and Russia at its ISO 13485 facility in Hungary. The agreement enables Newmars to manufacture LuViva\u00ae Advance Cervical Scan devices in Hungary for distribution in the nine Central and Eastern European countries for which Newmars has distribution rights. Guided Therapeutics will manufacture sub-assemblies and sell these and other parts to Newmars and will receive an additional $2,000 royalty for each device sold in those countries, which include Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Armenia, subject to certain minimum royalty payments and parts orders. The additional carve out for these territories has been agreed to by SMI. The Agreement with Newmars does not allow them to manufacture single use Cervical Guides, which the Company will continue to supply.\nWe received Regulatory Approval from the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to allow commercialization of the LuViva device and disposables. The Ministry concluded that the LuViva device is Non Invasive\u201d and as such is not regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Medical Device Rules 2017 thereunder.\u201d As a result, LuViva can now be commercialized in India.\nOn August 31, 2018, we entered into agreements with certain holders of the our Series C1 preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series C1 Preferred Stock\u201d), including John Imhoff, the chairman of our board of directors, and Mark Faupel, the Chief Operating Officer and a director of our company (the Exchange Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which those holders separately agreed to exchange each share of the Series C1 Preferred Stock held for one (1) share of our newly created Series C2 preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series C2 Preferred Stock\u201d). In total, for 3,262 shares of Series C1 Preferred Stock to be surrendered, we issued 3,262 shares of Series C2 Preferred Stock.\nOn October 19, 2018, we held our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting\u201d). As described in the our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as amended, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2018, at the Annual Meeting, stockholders voted and approved the following proposals: (1) the election of the director-nominees (the Directors\u201d) of our board of directors (the Board\u201d), with the five Directors receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast by holders of shares of common stock and holders of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class; (2) the ratification of the appointment of UHY LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common stock and of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class; (3) an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), to enable a potential reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of between 1-for-25 and 1-for-800, with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board and with such reverse split to be effected at such time and date on or before March 31, 2019, if at all, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion (the Reverse Split Amendment\u201d) by a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock and Series C2 Preferred Stock voting as a single class; (4) the adoption of an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, to, among other things, increase our authorized common stock from 1,000,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares; and (5) the adoption of our 2018 Stock Option Plan and the material terms thereunder (the Plan\u201d) by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common stock and of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class.\nOn November 7, 2018, we increased the number of common stock shares authorized from one billion to three billion.\nA 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on March 29, 2019. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur material accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to investors understanding of our financial results and condition, are discussed below. Because we are still early in our enterprise development, the number of these policies requiring explanation is limited. As we begin to generate increased revenue from different sources, we expect that the number of applicable policies and complexity of the judgments required will increase.\nRevenue Recognition: ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a single and comprehensive framework which sets out how much revenue is to be recognized, and when. The core principle is that a vendor should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the vendor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue will now be recognized by a vendor when control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In contrast, Revenue based revenue recognition around an analysis of the transfer of risks and rewards; this now forms one of a number of criteria that are assessed in determining whether control has been transferred. The application of the core principle in ASC 606 is carried out in five steps: Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer: a contract is defined as an agreement (including oral and implied), between two or more parties, that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for each of those rights and obligations. The contract needs to have commercial substance and it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: a performance obligation in a contract is a promise (including implicit) to transfer a good or service to the customer. Each performance obligation should be capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable in the contract. Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: transaction price is the amount of consideration that the entity can be entitled to, in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: for a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the entity will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation separately, in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The acceptable methods of allocating the transaction price include adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and, the residual approach in limited circumstances. Discounts given should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless certain criteria are met and reallocation of changes in standalone selling prices after inception is not permitted. Step 5 - Recognize revenue as and when the entity satisfies a performance obligation: the entity should recognize revenue at a point in time, except if it meets any of the three criteria, which will require recognition of revenue over time: the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset controlled by the customer, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the entity's performance as the entity performs, and the entity does not create an asset that has an alternative use to the entity and the entity has the right to be paid for performance to date.\nValuation of Deferred Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under the liability method, we recognize deferred assets and liabilities based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized against future taxable income.\nValuation of Equity Instruments Granted to Employee, Service Providers and Investors: On the date of issuance, the instruments are recorded at their fair value as determined using either the Black-Scholes valuation model or Monte Carlo Simulation model.\nBeneficial Conversion Features of Convertible Securities: Conversion options that are not bifurcated as a derivative pursuant to ASC 815 and not accounted for as a separate equity component under the cash conversion guidance are evaluated to determine whether they are beneficial to the investor at inception (a beneficial conversion feature) or may become beneficial in the future due to potential adjustments. The beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt which are outside the scope of ASC 815. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion option's in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as a dividend over either the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the dividend must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.\nAllowance for Accounts Receivable: We estimate losses from the inability of our distributors to make required payments and periodically review the payment history of each of our distributors, as well as their financial condition, and revise our reserves as a result.\nInventory Valuation: All inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined substantially on a first-in, first-out\u201d basis. Selling, general, and administrative expenses are not inventoried, but are charged to expense when purchased.\nReverse Stock Split: On March 29, 2019, the Company implemented a 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change. The reverse stock split decreased the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 2,135,478,405 shares of Common Stock to 2,669,348 shares as of that date.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of 2018 and 2017\nSales Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Loss from Devices and Disposables: Revenues from the sale of LuViva devices for 2018 and 2017 were approximately $57,000 and $244,000, respectively. Revenues in 2018 were approximately, $187,000 or 77% lower when compared to the same period in 2017, due to lack of funding to support sales and marketing efforts. Related costs of sales were approximately $89,000 and $530,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Costs of sales in 2018, were approximately, $441,000 or 83% lower when compared to the same period in 2017, due to increase in the inventory costs. This resulted in a gross loss of approximately $32,000 on the sales of devices and disposables for 2018 compared with a gross loss of approximately $286,000 for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $244,000, from approximately $334,000 in 2017. The decrease of $90,000, or 27%, was primarily due to cost reduction plans in research and development payroll expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $195,000, compared to $245,000 in 2017. The decrease, of approximately $50,000, or 20% was primarily due to Company-wide expense reduction and cost savings efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $1,077,000, compared to $2,256,000 for the same period in 2017. The decrease of approximately $1,179,000, or 52%, was primarily related to lower compensation and option expenses incurred during the same period. For 2018, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional fees, insurance, and paid and accrued compensation costs.\nOther Income: Other income was approximately $54,000 in 2018, compared to $18,000 in the same period in 2017, an increase of $36,000 or 200%. Other income consists of refunds from prior years for insurance policies.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense for 2018 increased to approximately $1,763,000, compared to $1,106,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase of approximately $657,000, or 59%, was primarily related to amortization expense of and interest recorded for the value of the beneficial conversion feature on convertible debt outstanding and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nFair Value of Warrants Recovery and Expense: Fair value of warrants recovery for 2018, increased to approximately $3,234,000 compared to fair value of warrants expense of $6,487,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase of approximately $9,721,000, or 150% was primarily due to the favorable significant changes in warrant conversion prices and decrease in stock price, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain from extinguishment of debt: Gain from the restructuring and exchange of debt due to officers for 2018 increased to approximately $1,039,000, compared to nil for the same period in 2017.\nNet Profit / Loss: Net profit attributable to common stockholders increased to approximately $900,000, or $1.95 per share, in 2018, from a net loss of $10,974,000, or $997.64 per share, in 2017. The decrease in the net loss of $11,874,000, or 108% was for reasons outlined above. As stated previously, our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily realized due to a $3.2 million gain in the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018 and a $1.0 million gain from extinguishment of debt.\nThere was no income tax benefit recorded for 2018 or 2017, due to recurring net operating losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. At December 31, 2018, we had cash of less than $1,000 and a negative working capital of approximately $10,530,000.\nOur major cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of cash out-flows of $1.4 million from operations, including approximately $1.0 million of net profit, and a net change from financing activities of $1.4 million, which primarily represented the proceeds received from issuance of common stock and warrants, and proceeds from debt financing. Our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily realized due to a $3.2 million gain in the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018.\nOn June 5, 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Shenghuo Medical, LLC pursuant to which we granted Shenghuo an exclusive license to manufacture, sell and distribute LuViva in Taiwan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Shenghuo was already our exclusive distributor in China, Macau and Hong Kong, and the license extended to manufacturing in those countries as well. Under the terms of the license agreement, once Shenghuo was capable of manufacturing LuViva in accordance with ISO 13485 for medical devices, Shenghuo would pay us a royalty equal to $2.00 or 20% of the distributor price (subject to a discount under certain circumstances), whichever is higher, per disposable distributed within Shenghuo's exclusive territories. In connection with the license grant, Shenghuo would underwrite the cost of securing approval of LuViva with Chinese Food and Drug Administration. At its option, Shenghuo also would provide up to $1.0 million in furtherance of our efforts to secure regulatory approval for LuViva from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in exchange for the right to receive payments equal to 2% of our future sales in the United States, up to an aggregate of $4.0 million. Pursuant to the license agreement, Shenghuo had the option to have a designee appointed to our board of directors (and Richard Blumberg is that designee). As partial consideration for, and as a condition to, the license, and to further align the strategic interests of the parties, we have agreed to issue a convertible note to Shenghuo, in exchange for an aggregate cash investment of $200,000. The note will provide for a payment to Shenghuo of $300,000, expected to be due the earlier of 90 days from issuance and consummation of any capital raising transaction by us with net cash proceeds of at least $1.0 million. The note will accrue interest at 20% per year on any unpaid amounts due after that date. The note will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share of $11,137, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. The note will be unsecured, and is expected to provide for customary events of default. We will also issue Shenghuo a five-year warrant exercisable immediately for approximately 22 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the conversion price of the note, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. On January 22, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with SMI, pursuant to which we granted SMI an exclusive global license to manufacture the LuViva device and related disposables (subject to a carve-out for manufacture in Turkey) and exclusive distribution rights in the Peoples Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In order to facilitate the SMI agreement, immediately prior to its execution we entered into an agreement with Shenghuo, regarding the previous license to Shenghuo. Under the terms of the new agreement, Shenghuo agreed to relinquish its manufacturing license and its distribution rights in SMI's territories, and to waive its rights under the original Shenghuo agreement, all for as long as SMI performs under the SMI agreement. See -Recent Developments.\u201d\nBetween June 13, 2016 and June 14, 2016, we entered into various agreements with holders of certain warrants (including John Imhoff, one of our directors) originally issued in May 2013, and with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC, holder of a warrant issued February 12, 2016, pursuant to which each holder separately agreed to exchange warrants for either (1) shares of common stock equal to 166% of the number of shares of common stock underlying the surrendered warrants, or (2) new warrants exercisable for 200% of the number of shares underlying the surrendered warrants, but without certain anti-dilution protections included with the surrendered warrants. As a result of the exchanges, we effectively eliminate any potential exponential increase in the number of underlying shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants. In total, for surrendered warrants then-exercisable for an aggregate of 22,460,938 shares of common stock (but subject to exponential increase upon operation of certain anti-dilution provisions), we issued or are obligated to issue 21 shares of common stock and new warrants that, if exercised as of June 14, 2016, would have been exercisable for an aggregate of 4,511 shares of common stock. In certain circumstances, in lieu of presently issuing all of the shares (for each holder that opted for shares of common stock), we and the holder further agreed that we will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable warrant exchange agreement, from time to time, be obligated to issue the remaining shares to the holder. No additional consideration will be payable in connection with the issuance of the remaining shares. The holders that elected to receive shares for their surrendered warrants have agreed that they will not sell shares on any trading day in an amount, in the aggregate, exceeding 20% of the composite aggregate trading volume of the common stock for that trading day. The holders that elected to receive new warrants will be required to surrender their old warrants upon consummation of our next public offering. The new warrants will have an initial exercise price equal to the exercise price of the surrendered warrants as of immediately prior to consummation of the offering, subject to customary downside price protection\u201d for as long as our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\nOn September 6, 2016, we entered into a royalty agreement with one of our directors, John Imhoff, and another stockholder, Dolores Maloof, pursuant to which we sold to them a royalty of future sales of single-use cervical guides for LuViva. Under the terms of the royalty agreement, and for consideration of $50,000, we will pay them an aggregate perpetual royalty initially equal to $0.10, and from and after October 2, 2016, equal to $0.20, for each disposable that we sell (or that is sold by a third party pursuant to a licensing arrangement with us).\nOn November 2, 2016, we entered into a lockup and exchange agreement with GHS Investments, LLC, holder of approximately $221,000 in outstanding principal amount of our secured promissory note and all of the outstanding shares of our Series C preferred stock. Pursuant to the agreement, upon the effectiveness of the 1:800 reverse stock split and continuing for 45 days after, GHS and its affiliates were prohibited from converting any portion of the secured promissory note or any of the shares of Series C preferred stock or selling any of our securities that they beneficially owned. We agreed that, upon consummation of our next financing, we would use $260,000 of net cash proceeds first, to repay GHS's portion of the secured promissory note and second, with any remaining amount from the $260,000, to repurchase a portion of GHS's shares of Series C preferred stock. In addition, GHS has agreed to exchange the stated value per share (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends) of its remaining shares of Series C preferred stock for new securities of the same type that we separately issue in the next qualifying financing we undertake, on a dollar-for-dollar basis in a private placement exchange.\nA 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on November 7, 2016. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nOn December 7, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC with regard to the $1,525,000 in outstanding principal amount of senior secured convertible note originally issued to GPB on February 11, 2016, and the $306,863 in outstanding principal amount of our secured promissory note that GPB holds. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, upon completion of the next financing resulting in at least $1 million in cash proceeds, GPB will exchange both securities for a new convertible note in principal amount of $1,831,863. The new convertible note will mature on the second anniversary of issuance and will accrue interest at a rate of 19% per year. We will pay monthly interest coupons and, beginning one year after issuance, will pay amortized quarterly principal payments. Subject to resale restrictions under Federal securities laws and the availability of sufficient authorized but unissued shares of our common stock, the new convertible note will be convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the holder's option, into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price equal to the price offered in the qualifying financing that triggers the exchange, subject to certain customary adjustments and anti-dilution provisions contained in the new convertible note. The new convertible note will include customary event of default provisions and a default interest rate of the lesser of 21% or the maximum amount permitted by law. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, GPB will be entitled to require us to redeem the new convertible note at 120% of the outstanding principal balance. The new convertible note will be secured by a lien on all of our assets, including our intellectual property, pursuant to the security agreement entered into by us and GPB in connection with the issuance of the original senior secured convertible note. We further agreed to amend the warrant issued with the original senior secured convertible note, to adjust the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant to equal the number of shares that will initially be issuable upon conversion of the new convertible note (without giving effect to any beneficial ownership limitations set forth in the terms of the new convertible note). As an inducement to GPB to enter into these transactions, we agreed to increase the royalty payable to GPB pursuant to its consulting agreement with us from 3.5% to 3.85% of revenues from the sales of our products.\nOn December 28, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor for the issuance and sale to investor of up to $330,000 in aggregate principal amount of 10% original issuance discount convertible promissory notes, for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000. On that date, we issued to the investor a note in the principal amount of $222,000, for a purchase price of $200,000. The note matures six months from their date of issuance and, in addition to the 10% original issue discount, accrue interest at a rate of 10% per year. We may prepay the notes, in whole or in part, for 115% of outstanding principal and interest until 30 days from issuance, for 125% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 31 to 60 days from issuance, and for 130% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 61 days from issuance until immediately prior to the maturity date. After six months from the date of issuance (i.e., if we fails to repay all principal and interest due under the notes at the maturity date), the investor may convert the notes, at any time, in whole or in part, into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price equal to 60% of the lowest volume weighted average price of our common stock during the 20 trading days prior to conversion, subject to certain customary adjustments and anti-dilution provisions contained in the note. As of December 31, 2018, we have fully amortized debt issuance costs $30,000 and original issue discount of $22,000. As of December 31, 2018, the balance due to the investor for the December 28, 2016 note, is zero.\nOn February 13, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Auctus Fund, LLC for the issuance and sale to Auctus of $170,000 in aggregate principal amount of a 12% convertible promissory note for an aggregate purchase price of $156,400 (representing a $13,600 original issue discount). On February 13, 2017, we issued the note to Auctus. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, we also issued to Auctus a warrant exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 250 shares of our common stock. The warrant is exercisable at any time, at an exercise price per share equal to $4.11 (110% of the closing price of the common stock on the day prior to issuance), subject to certain customary adjustments and price-protection provisions contained in the warrant. The warrant has a five-year term. The note matured nine months from the date of issuance and, in addition to the original issue discount, accrues interest at a rate of 12% per year. We could have prepaid the note, in whole or in part, for 115% of outstanding principal and interest until 30 days from issuance, for 125% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 31 to 60 days from issuance, and for 130% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 61 days from issuance to 180 days from issuance. After six months from the date of issuance, Auctus may convert the note, at any time, in whole or in part, into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price equal to the lower of the price offered in our next public offering or a 40% discount to the average of the two lowest trading prices of the common stock during the 20 trading days prior to the conversion, subject to certain customary adjustments and price-protection provisions contained in the note. The note includes customary events of default provisions and a default interest rate of 24% per year. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Auctus may require us to redeem the note (or convert it into shares of common stock) at 150% of the outstanding principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest.

We could have prepaid the note, in whole or in part, for 115% of outstanding principal and interest until 30 days from issuance, for 125% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 31 to 60 days from issuance, and for 130% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 61 days from issuance to 180 days from issuance. After nine months from the date of issuance, Auctus may convert the note, at any time, in whole or in part, into shares of the our common stock, at a conversion price equal to the lower of the price offered in the our next public offering or a 40% discount to the average of the two lowest trading prices of the common stock during the 20 trading days prior to the conversion, subject to certain customary adjustments and price-protection provisions contained in the note. The note includes customary events of default provisions and a default interest rate of 24% per year. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, Auctus may require us to redeem the note (or convert it into shares of common stock) at 150% of the outstanding principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of December 31, 2018, we had a net debt of $81,528, including unamortized original issue discount of $1,443, unamortized debt issuance costs of $6,279 and accrued interest of $5,385.\nSee -Recent Developments\u201d for information regarding capital-raising activities since December 31, 2018.\nWe will be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing, additional collaborative relationships or other arrangements, as soon as possible. We cannot be certain that our existing and available capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our funding requirements through 2019. We are evaluating various options to further reduce our cash requirements to operate at a reduced rate, as well as options to raise additional funds, including loans.\nGenerally, substantial capital will be required to develop our products, including completing product testing and clinical trials, obtaining all required U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals and clearances, and commencing and scaling up manufacturing and marketing our products. Any failure to obtain capital would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Based on discussions with our distributors, we expect to generate purchase orders for approximately $2 million in LuViva devices and disposables in 2019 and expect those purchase orders to result in actual sales of $1.5 million in 2019, representing what we view as current demand for our products. We cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of these additional purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products.\nOur financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming we will continue as a going concern. The above factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, as more fully discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contained herein and in the report of our independent registered public accounting firm accompanying our financial statements contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements, no special purpose entities, and no activities that include non-exchange-traded contracts accounted for at fair value.",

    "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva\u00ae Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light.\nLuViva provides a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva improves patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1992 under the name SpectRx, Inc.,\u201d and, on February 22, 2008, changed our name to Guided Therapeutics, Inc. At the same time, we renamed our wholly owned subsidiary, InterScan, which originally had been incorporated as Guided Therapeutics.\u201d\nSince our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants.\nOur prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry. This industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants, intense competition and a high failure rate. We have experienced operating losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2018 we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $137.6 million. To date, we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts and the early stages of marketing our products. We do not have significant experience in manufacturing, marketing or selling our products. We may not be successful in growing sales for our products. Moreover, required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. Our products may not ever gain market acceptance and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. The development and commercialization of our products requires substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development.\nOur product revenues to date have been limited. In 2018, the majority of our revenues were from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables. We expect that the majority of our revenue in 2019 will be derived from revenue from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables.\nCurrent Demand for LuViva\nBased on discussions with our distributors, we expect to generate purchase orders for approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million in LuViva devices and disposables in 2019 and expect those purchase orders to result in actual sales of $0.5 to $1.0 million in 2019, representing what we view as current demand for our products. We cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of these additional purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products.\nRecent Developments\nOn December 18, 2018, we entered into a co-development agreement with Newmars Technologies, Inc. ( NTI\u201d), whereby NTI will perform final assembly of the LuViva device for its contracted distribution countries in Eastern Europe and Russia at its ISO 13485 facility in Hungary. The agreement enables Newmars to manufacture LuViva\u00ae Advance Cervical Scan devices in Hungary for distribution in the nine Central and Eastern European countries for which Newmars has distribution rights. Guided Therapeutics will manufacture sub-assemblies and sell these and other parts to Newmars and will receive an additional $2,000 royalty for each device sold in those countries, which include Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Armenia, subject to certain minimum royalty payments and parts orders. The additional carve out for these territories has been agreed to by SMI. The Agreement with Newmars does not allow them to manufacture single use Cervical Guides, which the Company will continue to supply.\nWe received Regulatory Approval from the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to allow commercialization of the LuViva device and disposables. The Ministry concluded that the LuViva device is Non Invasive\u201d and as such is not regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Medical Device Rules 2017 thereunder.\u201d As a result, LuViva can now be commercialized in India.\nOn August 31, 2018, we entered into agreements with certain holders of the our Series C1 preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series C1 Preferred Stock\u201d), including John Imhoff, the chairman of our board of directors, and Mark Faupel, the Chief Operating Officer and a director of our company (the Exchange Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which those holders separately agreed to exchange each share of the Series C1 Preferred Stock held for one (1) share of our newly created Series C2 preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series C2 Preferred Stock\u201d). In total, for 3,262 shares of Series C1 Preferred Stock to be surrendered, we issued 3,262 shares of Series C2 Preferred Stock.\nOn October 19, 2018, we held our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting\u201d). As described in the our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as amended, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2018, at the Annual Meeting, stockholders voted and approved the following proposals: (1) the election of the director-nominees (the Directors\u201d) of our board of directors (the Board\u201d), with the five Directors receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast by holders of shares of common stock and holders of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class; (2) the ratification of the appointment of UHY LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common stock and of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class; (3) an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), to enable a potential reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of between 1-for-25 and 1-for-800, with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board and with such reverse split to be effected at such time and date on or before March 31, 2019, if at all, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion (the Reverse Split Amendment\u201d) by a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock and Series C2 Preferred Stock voting as a single class; (4) the adoption of an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, to, among other things, increase our authorized common stock from 1,000,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares; and (5) the adoption of our 2018 Stock Option Plan and the material terms thereunder (the Plan\u201d) by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common stock and of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class.\nOn November 7, 2018, we increased the number of common stock shares authorized from one billion to three billion.\nA 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on March 29, 2019. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur material accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to investors understanding of our financial results and condition, are discussed below. Because we are still early in our enterprise development, the number of these policies requiring explanation is limited. As we begin to generate increased revenue from different sources, we expect that the number of applicable policies and complexity of the judgments required will increase.\nRevenue Recognition: ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a single and comprehensive framework which sets out how much revenue is to be recognized, and when. The core principle is that a vendor should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the vendor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue will now be recognized by a vendor when control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In contrast, Revenue based revenue recognition around an analysis of the transfer of risks and rewards; this now forms one of a number of criteria that are assessed in determining whether control has been transferred. The application of the core principle in ASC 606 is carried out in five steps: Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer: a contract is defined as an agreement (including oral and implied), between two or more parties, that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for each of those rights and obligations. The contract needs to have commercial substance and it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: a performance obligation in a contract is a promise (including implicit) to transfer a good or service to the customer. Each performance obligation should be capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable in the contract. Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: transaction price is the amount of consideration that the entity can be entitled to, in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: for a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the entity will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation separately, in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The acceptable methods of allocating the transaction price include adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and, the residual approach in limited circumstances. Discounts given should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless certain criteria are met and reallocation of changes in standalone selling prices after inception is not permitted. Step 5 - Recognize revenue as and when the entity satisfies a performance obligation: the entity should recognize revenue at a point in time, except if it meets any of the three criteria, which will require recognition of revenue over time: the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset controlled by the customer, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the entity's performance as the entity performs, and the entity does not create an asset that has an alternative use to the entity and the entity has the right to be paid for performance to date.\nValuation of Deferred Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under the liability method, we recognize deferred assets and liabilities based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized against future taxable income.\nValuation of Equity Instruments Granted to Employee, Service Providers and Investors: On the date of issuance, the instruments are recorded at their fair value as determined using either the Black-Scholes valuation model or Monte Carlo Simulation model.\nBeneficial Conversion Features of Convertible Securities: Conversion options that are not bifurcated as a derivative pursuant to ASC 815 and not accounted for as a separate equity component under the cash conversion guidance are evaluated to determine whether they are beneficial to the investor at inception (a beneficial conversion feature) or may become beneficial in the future due to potential adjustments. The beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt which are outside the scope of ASC 815. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion option's in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as a dividend over either the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the dividend must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.\nAllowance for Accounts Receivable: We estimate losses from the inability of our distributors to make required payments and periodically review the payment history of each of our distributors, as well as their financial condition, and revise our reserves as a result.\nInventory Valuation: All inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined substantially on a first-in, first-out\u201d basis. Selling, general, and administrative expenses are not inventoried, but are charged to expense when purchased.\nReverse Stock Split: On March 29, 2019, the Company implemented a 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change. The reverse stock split decreased the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 2,135,478,405 shares of Common Stock to 2,669,348 shares as of that date.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of 2018 and 2017\nSales Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Loss from Devices and Disposables: Revenues from the sale of LuViva devices for 2018 and 2017 were approximately $57,000 and $244,000, respectively. Revenues in 2018 were approximately, $187,000 or 77% lower when compared to the same period in 2017, due to lack of funding to support sales and marketing efforts. Related costs of sales were approximately $89,000 and $530,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Costs of sales in 2018, were approximately, $441,000 or 83% lower when compared to the same period in 2017, due to increase in the inventory costs. This resulted in a gross loss of approximately $32,000 on the sales of devices and disposables for 2018 compared with a gross loss of approximately $286,000 for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $244,000, from approximately $334,000 in 2017. The decrease of $90,000, or 27%, was primarily due to cost reduction plans in research and development payroll expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $195,000, compared to $245,000 in 2017. The decrease, of approximately $50,000, or 20% was primarily due to Company-wide expense reduction and cost savings efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $1,077,000, compared to $2,256,000 for the same period in 2017. The decrease of approximately $1,179,000, or 52%, was primarily related to lower compensation and option expenses incurred during the same period. For 2018, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional fees, insurance, and paid and accrued compensation costs.\nOther Income: Other income was approximately $54,000 in 2018, compared to $18,000 in the same period in 2017, an increase of $36,000 or 200%. Other income consists of refunds from prior years for insurance policies.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense for 2018 increased to approximately $1,763,000, compared to $1,106,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase of approximately $657,000, or 59%, was primarily related to amortization expense of and interest recorded for the value of the beneficial conversion feature on convertible debt outstanding and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nFair Value of Warrants Recovery and Expense: Fair value of warrants recovery for 2018, increased to approximately $3,234,000 compared to fair value of warrants expense of $6,487,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase of approximately $9,721,000, or 150% was primarily due to the favorable significant changes in warrant conversion prices and decrease in stock price, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain from extinguishment of debt: Gain from the restructuring and exchange of debt due to officers for 2018 increased to approximately $1,039,000, compared to nil for the same period in 2017.\nNet Profit / Loss: Net profit attributable to common stockholders increased to approximately $900,000, or $1.95 per share, in 2018, from a net loss of $10,974,000, or $997.64 per share, in 2017. The decrease in the net loss of $11,874,000, or 108% was for reasons outlined above. As stated previously, our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily realized due to a $3.2 million gain in the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018 and a $1.0 million gain from extinguishment of debt.\nThere was no income tax benefit recorded for 2018 or 2017, due to recurring net operating losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. At December 31, 2018, we had cash of less than $1,000 and a negative working capital of approximately $10,530,000.\nOur major cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of cash out-flows of $1.4 million from operations, including approximately $1.0 million of net profit, and a net change from financing activities of $1.4 million, which primarily represented the proceeds received from issuance of common stock and warrants, and proceeds from debt financing. Our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily realized due to a $3.2 million gain in the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018.\nOn June 5, 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Shenghuo Medical, LLC pursuant to which we granted Shenghuo an exclusive license to manufacture, sell and distribute LuViva in Taiwan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Shenghuo was already our exclusive distributor in China, Macau and Hong Kong, and the license extended to manufacturing in those countries as well. Under the terms of the license agreement, once Shenghuo was capable of manufacturing LuViva in accordance with ISO 13485 for medical devices, Shenghuo would pay us a royalty equal to $2.00 or 20% of the distributor price (subject to a discount under certain circumstances), whichever is higher, per disposable distributed within Shenghuo's exclusive territories. In connection with the license grant, Shenghuo would underwrite the cost of securing approval of LuViva with Chinese Food and Drug Administration. At its option, Shenghuo also would provide up to $1.0 million in furtherance of our efforts to secure regulatory approval for LuViva from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in exchange for the right to receive payments equal to 2% of our future sales in the United States, up to an aggregate of $4.0 million. Pursuant to the license agreement, Shenghuo had the option to have a designee appointed to our board of directors (and Richard Blumberg is that designee). As partial consideration for, and as a condition to, the license, and to further align the strategic interests of the parties, we have agreed to issue a convertible note to Shenghuo, in exchange for an aggregate cash investment of $200,000. The note will provide for a payment to Shenghuo of $300,000, expected to be due the earlier of 90 days from issuance and consummation of any capital raising transaction by us with net cash proceeds of at least $1.0 million. The note will accrue interest at 20% per year on any unpaid amounts due after that date. The note will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share of $11,137, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. The note will be unsecured, and is expected to provide for customary events of default. We will also issue Shenghuo a five-year warrant exercisable immediately for approximately 22 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the conversion price of the note, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. On January 22, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with SMI, pursuant to which we granted SMI an exclusive global license to manufacture the LuViva device and related disposables (subject to a carve-out for manufacture in Turkey) and exclusive distribution rights in the Peoples Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In order to facilitate the SMI agreement, immediately prior to its execution we entered into an agreement with Shenghuo, regarding the previous license to Shenghuo. Under the terms of the new agreement, Shenghuo agreed to relinquish its manufacturing license and its distribution rights in SMI's territories, and to waive its rights under the original Shenghuo agreement, all for as long as SMI performs under the SMI agreement. See -Recent Developments.\u201d\nBetween June 13, 2016 and June 14, 2016, we entered into various agreements with holders of certain warrants (including John Imhoff, one of our directors) originally issued in May 2013, and with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC, holder of a warrant issued February 12, 2016, pursuant to which each holder separately agreed to exchange warrants for either (1) shares of common stock equal to 166% of the number of shares of common stock underlying the surrendered warrants, or (2) new warrants exercisable for 200% of the number of shares underlying the surrendered warrants, but without certain anti-dilution protections included with the surrendered warrants. As a result of the exchanges, we effectively eliminate any potential exponential increase in the number of underlying shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants. In total, for surrendered warrants then-exercisable for an aggregate of 22,460,938 shares of common stock (but subject to exponential increase upon operation of certain anti-dilution provisions), we issued or are obligated to issue 21 shares of common stock and new warrants that, if exercised as of June 14, 2016, would have been exercisable for an aggregate of 4,511 shares of common stock. In certain circumstances, in lieu of presently issuing all of the shares (for each holder that opted for shares of common stock), we and the holder further agreed that we will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable warrant exchange agreement, from time to time, be obligated to issue the remaining shares to the holder. No additional consideration will be payable in connection with the issuance of the remaining shares. The holders that elected to receive shares for their surrendered warrants have agreed that they will not sell shares on any trading day in an amount, in the aggregate, exceeding 20% of the composite aggregate trading volume of the common stock for that trading day. The holders that elected to receive new warrants will be required to surrender their old warrants upon consummation of our next public offering. The new warrants will have an initial exercise price equal to the exercise price of the surrendered warrants as of immediately prior to consummation of the offering, subject to customary downside price protection\u201d for as long as our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\nOn September 6, 2016, we entered into a royalty agreement with one of our directors, John Imhoff, and another stockholder, Dolores Maloof, pursuant to which we sold to them a royalty of future sales of single-use cervical guides for LuViva. Under the terms of the royalty agreement, and for consideration of $50,000, we will pay them an aggregate perpetual royalty initially equal to $0.10, and from and after October 2, 2016, equal to $0.20, for each disposable that we sell (or that is sold by a third party pursuant to a licensing arrangement with us).\nOn November 2, 2016, we entered into a lockup and exchange agreement with GHS Investments, LLC, holder of approximately $221,000 in outstanding principal amount of our secured promissory note and all of the outstanding shares of our Series C preferred stock. Pursuant to the agreement, upon the effectiveness of the 1:800 reverse stock split and continuing for 45 days after, GHS and its affiliates were prohibited from converting any portion of the secured promissory note or any of the shares of Series C preferred stock or selling any of our securities that they beneficially owned. We agreed that, upon consummation of our next financing, we would use $260,000 of net cash proceeds first, to repay GHS's portion of the secured promissory note and second, with any remaining amount from the $260,000, to repurchase a portion of GHS's shares of Series C preferred stock. In addition, GHS has agreed to exchange the stated value per share (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends) of its remaining shares of Series C preferred stock for new securities of the same type that we separately issue in the next qualifying financing we undertake, on a dollar-for-dollar basis in a private placement exchange.\nA 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on November 7, 2016. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nOn December 7, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC with regard to the $1,525,000 in outstanding principal amount of senior secured convertible note originally issued to GPB on February 11, 2016, and the $306,863 in outstanding principal amount of our secured promissory note that GPB holds. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, upon completion of the next financing resulting in at least $1 million in cash proceeds, GPB will exchange both securities for a new convertible note in principal amount of $1,831,863. The new convertible note will mature on the second anniversary of issuance and will accrue interest at a rate of 19% per year. We will pay monthly interest coupons and, beginning one year after issuance, will pay amortized quarterly principal payments. Subject to resale restrictions under Federal securities laws and the availability of sufficient authorized but unissued shares of our common stock, the new convertible note will be convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the holder's option, into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price equal to the price offered in the qualifying financing that triggers the exchange, subject to certain customary adjustments and anti-dilution provisions contained in the new convertible note. The new convertible note will include customary event of default provisions and a default interest rate of the lesser of 21% or the maximum amount permitted by law. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, GPB will be entitled to require us to redeem the new convertible note at 120% of the outstanding principal balance. The new convertible note will be secured by a lien on all of our assets, including our intellectual property, pursuant to the security agreement entered into by us and GPB in connection with the issuance of the original senior secured convertible note. We further agreed to amend the warrant issued with the original senior secured convertible note, to adjust the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant to equal the number of shares that will initially be issuable upon conversion of the new convertible note (without giving effect to any beneficial ownership limitations set forth in the terms of the new convertible note). As an inducement to GPB to enter into these transactions, we agreed to increase the royalty payable to GPB pursuant to its consulting agreement with us from 3.5% to 3.85% of revenues from the sales of our products.\nOn December 28, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor for the issuance and sale to investor of up to $330,000 in aggregate principal amount of 10% original issuance discount convertible promissory notes, for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000. On that date, we issued to the investor a note in the principal amount of $222,000, for a purchase price of $200,000. The note matures six months from their date of issuance and, in addition to the 10% original issue discount, accrue interest at a rate of 10% per year. We may prepay the notes, in whole or in part, for 115% of outstanding principal and interest until 30 days from issuance, for 125% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 31 to 60 days from issuance, and for 130% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 61 days from issuance until immediately prior to the maturity date. After six months from the date of issuance (i.e., if we fails to repay all principal and interest due under the notes at the maturity date),",
    "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva\u00ae Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light.\nLuViva provides a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva improves patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, originally incorporated in 1992 under the name SpectRx, Inc.,\u201d and, on February 22, 2008, changed our name to Guided Therapeutics, Inc. At the same time, we renamed our wholly owned subsidiary, InterScan, which originally had been incorporated as Guided Therapeutics.\u201d\nSince our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants.\nOur prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry. This industry is characterized by an increasing number of participants, intense competition and a high failure rate. We have experienced operating losses since our inception and, as of December 31, 2018 we have an accumulated deficit of approximately $137.6 million. To date, we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts and the early stages of marketing our products. We do not have significant experience in manufacturing, marketing or selling our products. We may not be successful in growing sales for our products. Moreover, required regulatory clearances or approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. Our products may not ever gain market acceptance and we may not ever generate significant revenues or achieve profitability. The development and commercialization of our products requires substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals, build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development.\nOur product revenues to date have been limited. In 2018, the majority of our revenues were from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables. We expect that the majority of our revenue in 2019 will be derived from revenue from the sale of LuViva devices and disposables.\nCurrent Demand for LuViva\nBased on discussions with our distributors, we expect to generate purchase orders for approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million in LuViva devices and disposables in 2019 and expect those purchase orders to result in actual sales of $0.5 to $1.0 million in 2019, representing what we view as current demand for our products. We cannot be assured that we will generate all or any of these additional purchase orders, or that existing orders will not be canceled by the distributors or that parts to build product will be available to meet demand, such that existing orders will result in actual sales. Because we have a short history of sales of our products, we cannot confidently predict future sales of our products beyond this time frame and cannot be assured of any particular amount of sales. Accordingly, we have not identified any particular trends with regard to sales of our products.\nRecent Developments\nOn December 18, 2018, we entered into a co-development agreement with Newmars Technologies, Inc. ( NTI\u201d), whereby NTI will perform final assembly of the LuViva device for its contracted distribution countries in Eastern Europe and Russia at its ISO 13485 facility in Hungary. The agreement enables Newmars to manufacture LuViva\u00ae Advance Cervical Scan devices in Hungary for distribution in the nine Central and Eastern European countries for which Newmars has distribution rights. Guided Therapeutics will manufacture sub-assemblies and sell these and other parts to Newmars and will receive an additional $2,000 royalty for each device sold in those countries, which include Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Armenia, subject to certain minimum royalty payments and parts orders. The additional carve out for these territories has been agreed to by SMI. The Agreement with Newmars does not allow them to manufacture single use Cervical Guides, which the Company will continue to supply.\nWe received Regulatory Approval from the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to allow commercialization of the LuViva device and disposables. The Ministry concluded that the LuViva device is Non Invasive\u201d and as such is not regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and Medical Device Rules 2017 thereunder.\u201d As a result, LuViva can now be commercialized in India.\nOn August 31, 2018, we entered into agreements with certain holders of the our Series C1 preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series C1 Preferred Stock\u201d), including John Imhoff, the chairman of our board of directors, and Mark Faupel, the Chief Operating Officer and a director of our company (the Exchange Agreements\u201d), pursuant to which those holders separately agreed to exchange each share of the Series C1 Preferred Stock held for one (1) share of our newly created Series C2 preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series C2 Preferred Stock\u201d). In total, for 3,262 shares of Series C1 Preferred Stock to be surrendered, we issued 3,262 shares of Series C2 Preferred Stock.\nOn October 19, 2018, we held our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting\u201d). As described in the our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, as amended, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 11, 2018, at the Annual Meeting, stockholders voted and approved the following proposals: (1) the election of the director-nominees (the Directors\u201d) of our board of directors (the Board\u201d), with the five Directors receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast by holders of shares of common stock and holders of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class; (2) the ratification of the appointment of UHY LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common stock and of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class; (3) an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Incorporation\u201d), to enable a potential reverse split of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of between 1-for-25 and 1-for-800, with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board and with such reverse split to be effected at such time and date on or before March 31, 2019, if at all, as determined by the Board in its sole discretion (the Reverse Split Amendment\u201d) by a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock and Series C2 Preferred Stock voting as a single class; (4) the adoption of an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation, to, among other things, increase our authorized common stock from 1,000,000,000 shares to 3,000,000,000 shares; and (5) the adoption of our 2018 Stock Option Plan and the material terms thereunder (the Plan\u201d) by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of common stock and of Series C2 Preferred Stock, voting as a single class.\nOn November 7, 2018, we increased the number of common stock shares authorized from one billion to three billion.\nA 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on March 29, 2019. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur material accounting policies, which we believe are the most critical to investors understanding of our financial results and condition, are discussed below. Because we are still early in our enterprise development, the number of these policies requiring explanation is limited. As we begin to generate increased revenue from different sources, we expect that the number of applicable policies and complexity of the judgments required will increase.\nRevenue Recognition: ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers establishes a single and comprehensive framework which sets out how much revenue is to be recognized, and when. The core principle is that a vendor should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the vendor expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue will now be recognized by a vendor when control over the goods or services is transferred to the customer. In contrast, Revenue based revenue recognition around an analysis of the transfer of risks and rewards; this now forms one of a number of criteria that are assessed in determining whether control has been transferred. The application of the core principle in ASC 606 is carried out in five steps: Step 1 - Identify the contract with a customer: a contract is defined as an agreement (including oral and implied), between two or more parties, that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for each of those rights and obligations. The contract needs to have commercial substance and it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled. Step 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract: a performance obligation in a contract is a promise (including implicit) to transfer a good or service to the customer. Each performance obligation should be capable of being distinct and is separately identifiable in the contract. Step 3 - Determine the transaction price: transaction price is the amount of consideration that the entity can be entitled to, in exchange for transferring the promised goods and services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: for a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the entity will allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation separately, in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. The acceptable methods of allocating the transaction price include adjusted market assessment approach, expected cost plus a margin approach, and, the residual approach in limited circumstances. Discounts given should be allocated proportionately to all performance obligations unless certain criteria are met and reallocation of changes in standalone selling prices after inception is not permitted. Step 5 - Recognize revenue as and when the entity satisfies a performance obligation: the entity should recognize revenue at a point in time, except if it meets any of the three criteria, which will require recognition of revenue over time: the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset controlled by the customer, the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the entity's performance as the entity performs, and the entity does not create an asset that has an alternative use to the entity and the entity has the right to be paid for performance to date.\nValuation of Deferred Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method. Under the liability method, we recognize deferred assets and liabilities based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We establish a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized against future taxable income.\nValuation of Equity Instruments Granted to Employee, Service Providers and Investors: On the date of issuance, the instruments are recorded at their fair value as determined using either the Black-Scholes valuation model or Monte Carlo Simulation model.\nBeneficial Conversion Features of Convertible Securities: Conversion options that are not bifurcated as a derivative pursuant to ASC 815 and not accounted for as a separate equity component under the cash conversion guidance are evaluated to determine whether they are beneficial to the investor at inception (a beneficial conversion feature) or may become beneficial in the future due to potential adjustments. The beneficial conversion feature guidance in ASC 470-20 applies to convertible stock as well as convertible debt which are outside the scope of ASC 815. A beneficial conversion feature is defined as a nondetachable conversion feature that is in the money at the commitment date. The beneficial conversion feature guidance requires recognition of the conversion option's in-the-money portion, the intrinsic value of the option, in equity, with an offsetting reduction to the carrying amount of the instrument. The resulting discount is amortized as a dividend over either the life of the instrument, if a stated maturity date exists, or to the earliest conversion date, if there is no stated maturity date. If the earliest conversion date is immediately upon issuance, the dividend must be recognized at inception. When there is a subsequent change to the conversion ratio based on a future occurrence, the new conversion price may trigger the recognition of an additional beneficial conversion feature on occurrence.\nAllowance for Accounts Receivable: We estimate losses from the inability of our distributors to make required payments and periodically review the payment history of each of our distributors, as well as their financial condition, and revise our reserves as a result.\nInventory Valuation: All inventories are stated at lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined substantially on a first-in, first-out\u201d basis. Selling, general, and administrative expenses are not inventoried, but are charged to expense when purchased.\nReverse Stock Split: On March 29, 2019, the Company implemented a 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change. The reverse stock split decreased the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 2,135,478,405 shares of Common Stock to 2,669,348 shares as of that date.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of 2018 and 2017\nSales Revenue, Cost of Sales and Gross Loss from Devices and Disposables: Revenues from the sale of LuViva devices for 2018 and 2017 were approximately $57,000 and $244,000, respectively. Revenues in 2018 were approximately, $187,000 or 77% lower when compared to the same period in 2017, due to lack of funding to support sales and marketing efforts. Related costs of sales were approximately $89,000 and $530,000 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Costs of sales in 2018, were approximately, $441,000 or 83% lower when compared to the same period in 2017, due to increase in the inventory costs. This resulted in a gross loss of approximately $32,000 on the sales of devices and disposables for 2018 compared with a gross loss of approximately $286,000 for the same period in 2017.\nResearch and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $244,000, from approximately $334,000 in 2017. The decrease of $90,000, or 27%, was primarily due to cost reduction plans in research and development payroll expenses.\nSales and Marketing Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $195,000, compared to $245,000 in 2017. The decrease, of approximately $50,000, or 20% was primarily due to Company-wide expense reduction and cost savings efforts.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense: General and administrative expenses for 2018, decreased to approximately $1,077,000, compared to $2,256,000 for the same period in 2017. The decrease of approximately $1,179,000, or 52%, was primarily related to lower compensation and option expenses incurred during the same period. For 2018, general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of professional fees, insurance, and paid and accrued compensation costs.\nOther Income: Other income was approximately $54,000 in 2018, compared to $18,000 in the same period in 2017, an increase of $36,000 or 200%. Other income consists of refunds from prior years for insurance policies.\nInterest Expense: Interest expense for 2018 increased to approximately $1,763,000, compared to $1,106,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase of approximately $657,000, or 59%, was primarily related to amortization expense of and interest recorded for the value of the beneficial conversion feature on convertible debt outstanding and amortization of debt issuance costs.\nFair Value of Warrants Recovery and Expense: Fair value of warrants recovery for 2018, increased to approximately $3,234,000 compared to fair value of warrants expense of $6,487,000 for the same period in 2017. The increase of approximately $9,721,000, or 150% was primarily due to the favorable significant changes in warrant conversion prices and decrease in stock price, in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nGain from extinguishment of debt: Gain from the restructuring and exchange of debt due to officers for 2018 increased to approximately $1,039,000, compared to nil for the same period in 2017.\nNet Profit / Loss: Net profit attributable to common stockholders increased to approximately $900,000, or $1.95 per share, in 2018, from a net loss of $10,974,000, or $997.64 per share, in 2017. The decrease in the net loss of $11,874,000, or 108% was for reasons outlined above. As stated previously, our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily realized due to a $3.2 million gain in the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018 and a $1.0 million gain from extinguishment of debt.\nThere was no income tax benefit recorded for 2018 or 2017, due to recurring net operating losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have raised capital through the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. At December 31, 2018, we had cash of less than $1,000 and a negative working capital of approximately $10,530,000.\nOur major cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of cash out-flows of $1.4 million from operations, including approximately $1.0 million of net profit, and a net change from financing activities of $1.4 million, which primarily represented the proceeds received from issuance of common stock and warrants, and proceeds from debt financing. Our net profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily realized due to a $3.2 million gain in the fair value of warrants recorded in 2018.\nOn June 5, 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Shenghuo Medical, LLC pursuant to which we granted Shenghuo an exclusive license to manufacture, sell and distribute LuViva in Taiwan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Shenghuo was already our exclusive distributor in China, Macau and Hong Kong, and the license extended to manufacturing in those countries as well. Under the terms of the license agreement, once Shenghuo was capable of manufacturing LuViva in accordance with ISO 13485 for medical devices, Shenghuo would pay us a royalty equal to $2.00 or 20% of the distributor price (subject to a discount under certain circumstances), whichever is higher, per disposable distributed within Shenghuo's exclusive territories. In connection with the license grant, Shenghuo would underwrite the cost of securing approval of LuViva with Chinese Food and Drug Administration. At its option, Shenghuo also would provide up to $1.0 million in furtherance of our efforts to secure regulatory approval for LuViva from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in exchange for the right to receive payments equal to 2% of our future sales in the United States, up to an aggregate of $4.0 million. Pursuant to the license agreement, Shenghuo had the option to have a designee appointed to our board of directors (and Richard Blumberg is that designee). As partial consideration for, and as a condition to, the license, and to further align the strategic interests of the parties, we have agreed to issue a convertible note to Shenghuo, in exchange for an aggregate cash investment of $200,000. The note will provide for a payment to Shenghuo of $300,000, expected to be due the earlier of 90 days from issuance and consummation of any capital raising transaction by us with net cash proceeds of at least $1.0 million. The note will accrue interest at 20% per year on any unpaid amounts due after that date. The note will be convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share of $11,137, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. The note will be unsecured, and is expected to provide for customary events of default. We will also issue Shenghuo a five-year warrant exercisable immediately for approximately 22 shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to the conversion price of the note, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustment. On January 22, 2017, we entered into a license agreement with SMI, pursuant to which we granted SMI an exclusive global license to manufacture the LuViva device and related disposables (subject to a carve-out for manufacture in Turkey) and exclusive distribution rights in the Peoples Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In order to facilitate the SMI agreement, immediately prior to its execution we entered into an agreement with Shenghuo, regarding the previous license to Shenghuo. Under the terms of the new agreement, Shenghuo agreed to relinquish its manufacturing license and its distribution rights in SMI's territories, and to waive its rights under the original Shenghuo agreement, all for as long as SMI performs under the SMI agreement. See -Recent Developments.\u201d\nBetween June 13, 2016 and June 14, 2016, we entered into various agreements with holders of certain warrants (including John Imhoff, one of our directors) originally issued in May 2013, and with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC, holder of a warrant issued February 12, 2016, pursuant to which each holder separately agreed to exchange warrants for either (1) shares of common stock equal to 166% of the number of shares of common stock underlying the surrendered warrants, or (2) new warrants exercisable for 200% of the number of shares underlying the surrendered warrants, but without certain anti-dilution protections included with the surrendered warrants. As a result of the exchanges, we effectively eliminate any potential exponential increase in the number of underlying shares issuable upon exercise of our outstanding warrants. In total, for surrendered warrants then-exercisable for an aggregate of 22,460,938 shares of common stock (but subject to exponential increase upon operation of certain anti-dilution provisions), we issued or are obligated to issue 21 shares of common stock and new warrants that, if exercised as of June 14, 2016, would have been exercisable for an aggregate of 4,511 shares of common stock. In certain circumstances, in lieu of presently issuing all of the shares (for each holder that opted for shares of common stock), we and the holder further agreed that we will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable warrant exchange agreement, from time to time, be obligated to issue the remaining shares to the holder. No additional consideration will be payable in connection with the issuance of the remaining shares. The holders that elected to receive shares for their surrendered warrants have agreed that they will not sell shares on any trading day in an amount, in the aggregate, exceeding 20% of the composite aggregate trading volume of the common stock for that trading day. The holders that elected to receive new warrants will be required to surrender their old warrants upon consummation of our next public offering. The new warrants will have an initial exercise price equal to the exercise price of the surrendered warrants as of immediately prior to consummation of the offering, subject to customary downside price protection\u201d for as long as our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, and will expire five years from the date of issuance.\nOn September 6, 2016, we entered into a royalty agreement with one of our directors, John Imhoff, and another stockholder, Dolores Maloof, pursuant to which we sold to them a royalty of future sales of single-use cervical guides for LuViva. Under the terms of the royalty agreement, and for consideration of $50,000, we will pay them an aggregate perpetual royalty initially equal to $0.10, and from and after October 2, 2016, equal to $0.20, for each disposable that we sell (or that is sold by a third party pursuant to a licensing arrangement with us).\nOn November 2, 2016, we entered into a lockup and exchange agreement with GHS Investments, LLC, holder of approximately $221,000 in outstanding principal amount of our secured promissory note and all of the outstanding shares of our Series C preferred stock. Pursuant to the agreement, upon the effectiveness of the 1:800 reverse stock split and continuing for 45 days after, GHS and its affiliates were prohibited from converting any portion of the secured promissory note or any of the shares of Series C preferred stock or selling any of our securities that they beneficially owned. We agreed that, upon consummation of our next financing, we would use $260,000 of net cash proceeds first, to repay GHS's portion of the secured promissory note and second, with any remaining amount from the $260,000, to repurchase a portion of GHS's shares of Series C preferred stock. In addition, GHS has agreed to exchange the stated value per share (plus any accrued but unpaid dividends) of its remaining shares of Series C preferred stock for new securities of the same type that we separately issue in the next qualifying financing we undertake, on a dollar-for-dollar basis in a private placement exchange.\nA 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented on November 7, 2016. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nOn December 7, 2016, we entered into an exchange agreement with GPB Debt Holdings II LLC with regard to the $1,525,000 in outstanding principal amount of senior secured convertible note originally issued to GPB on February 11, 2016, and the $306,863 in outstanding principal amount of our secured promissory note that GPB holds. Pursuant to the exchange agreement, upon completion of the next financing resulting in at least $1 million in cash proceeds, GPB will exchange both securities for a new convertible note in principal amount of $1,831,863. The new convertible note will mature on the second anniversary of issuance and will accrue interest at a rate of 19% per year. We will pay monthly interest coupons and, beginning one year after issuance, will pay amortized quarterly principal payments. Subject to resale restrictions under Federal securities laws and the availability of sufficient authorized but unissued shares of our common stock, the new convertible note will be convertible at any time, in whole or in part, at the holder's option, into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price equal to the price offered in the qualifying financing that triggers the exchange, subject to certain customary adjustments and anti-dilution provisions contained in the new convertible note. The new convertible note will include customary event of default provisions and a default interest rate of the lesser of 21% or the maximum amount permitted by law. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, GPB will be entitled to require us to redeem the new convertible note at 120% of the outstanding principal balance. The new convertible note will be secured by a lien on all of our assets, including our intellectual property, pursuant to the security agreement entered into by us and GPB in connection with the issuance of the original senior secured convertible note. We further agreed to amend the warrant issued with the original senior secured convertible note, to adjust the number of shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant to equal the number of shares that will initially be issuable upon conversion of the new convertible note (without giving effect to any beneficial ownership limitations set forth in the terms of the new convertible note). As an inducement to GPB to enter into these transactions, we agreed to increase the royalty payable to GPB pursuant to its consulting agreement with us from 3.5% to 3.85% of revenues from the sales of our products.\nOn December 28, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an investor for the issuance and sale to investor of up to $330,000 in aggregate principal amount of 10% original issuance discount convertible promissory notes, for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000. On that date, we issued to the investor a note in the principal amount of $222,000, for a purchase price of $200,000. The note matures six months from their date of issuance and, in addition to the 10% original issue discount, accrue interest at a rate of 10% per year. We may prepay the notes, in whole or in part, for 115% of outstanding principal and interest until 30 days from issuance, for 125% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 31 to 60 days from issuance, and for 130% of outstanding principal and interest at any time from 61 days from issuance until immediately prior to the maturity date. After six months from the date of issuance (i.e., if we fails to repay all principal and interest due under the notes at the maturity date),"
