MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis.\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading manufacturer of rigid packaging for consumer goods products. We currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and general line products; dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care and beauty products; and custom designed plastic containers for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical products. We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in North America with a unit volume market share in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2020 of slightly more than half of the market, a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care and beauty products, and a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in North America for a variety of markets, including the personal care, food, health care and household and industrial chemical markets.\nOur objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, reduce operating costs, build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. We have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth, and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market.\nSALES GROWTH\nWe have increased net sales and market share in our metal container, closures and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth. As a result, we have expanded and diversified our customer base, geographic presence and product lines.\nWe are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, primarily as a result of our acquisitions but also as a result of growth with existing customers. During approximately the past three decades, the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self-manufacture their metal food containers. Our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of Nestl\u00e9, Dial, Del Monte, Birds Eye, Campbell, Pacific Coast and Purina Steel Can reflect this trend. We estimate that approximately eight percent of the market for metal food containers in the United States is still served by self-manufacturers. Prior to 2020, the metal food container market in North America was relatively flat during this period of consolidation, despite losing market share as a result of more dining out, fresh produce and competing materials. Despite a relatively flat market, we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the United States primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers. We also enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value-added features such as our Quick Top\u00ae easy-open ends, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In 2020, we experienced a significant increase in demand for many of our products, including metal food containers. Our unit volumes for metal food containers increased approximately 14 percent in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher demand in at-home food consumption. For 2021, we anticipate that demand levels for our metal food containers will continue to be strong principally due to continued higher demand in at-home food consumption.\nWith our acquisitions of our closures operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, and beauty products. In 2017, we broadened our closures portfolio to include dispensing systems with our acquisition of SDS and in 2020, we further expanded our dispensing systems operations with our acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, net sales of our closures business have increased to $1.71 billion in 2020 as a result of acquisitions and internal growth, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.2 percent over that period. We may pursue further acquisition opportunities in the closures markets in which we operate, including in dispensing systems, or in adjacent closures markets, such as our acquisitions of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics. Additionally, we expect to continue to\ngenerate internal growth in our closures business, particularly in plastic closures and dispensing systems. In 2020, unit volumes for our closures business increased approximately 8 percent principally as a result of the acquisitions we completed in 2020 and strong volumes for consumer health, hygiene, personal care, food and beverage products. For 2021, we expect demand levels for consumer health, hygiene, personal care, food and beverage products to continue to be strong. Additionally, 2021 will include a full year of volumes from our acquisitions completed in 2020.\nWe have improved the market position of our plastic container business since 1987, with net sales increasing to $651.5 million in 2020, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.2 percent over that period. We achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth. Since 2016, we have made strategic investments to enhance the competitive position of our plastic container business, including the construction of three new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. The plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented, with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials. We have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care. We intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value-added operating expertise and strategy. In 2020, our plastic container business realized a significant increase in volumes of approximately 11 percent primarily due to higher demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products and continued new business awards. We anticipate that demand levels for our plastic containers will continue to be strong in 2021, driven largely by new business awards and continued high demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products.\nOPERATING PERFORMANCE\nWe operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure. We have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions and the optimization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. Our acquisitions and investments have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling. From 2015, we have closed six metal container manufacturing facilities, two closures manufacturing facility and three plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations, reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand. In 2019, we initiated a multi-year footprint optimization plan in our metal container business in the U.S. to reduce capacity and continue to drive cost reductions. As part of this plan, we shut down two metal container manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019. We delayed further implementation of this footprint optimization plan in 2020 due to a strong increase in demand for our products.\nWe have also invested substantial capital in the past several years for new market opportunities and value-added products such as Quick Top\u00ae easy-open ends for metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2016, we completed optimization plans in each of our businesses that reduced manufacturing and logistical costs and provided productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets. In conjunction with these optimization plans, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities. The three new manufacturing facilities are strategically located to meet the unique needs of our customers. In addition to optimizing freight and logistical costs, these three new facilities allowed us to further reduce costs and rationalize our manufacturing footprint. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a new metal container manufacturing facility and a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility, in each case to support continued growth in key markets.\nHistorically, we have been successful in renewing our multi-year supply arrangements with our customers. We estimate that in 2021 approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales and a majority of our projected closures and plastic containers sales will be under multi-year arrangements.\nMany of our multi-year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material, labor and other manufacturing costs, thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs. Our metal container and metal closure supply agreements with our\ncustomers provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our metal container and metal closure customers without long-term contracts, we have also generally changed prices to pass through changes in our metal costs. Our plastic closure, dispensing systems and plastic container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our resin costs, subject in many cases to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For our plastic closure, dispensing systems and plastic container customers without long-term contracts, we have also generally passed through changes in our resin costs.\nOur metal container business' sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. Our closures business is also dependent, in part, upon vegetable and fruit harvests. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter. Additionally, as is common in the packaging industry, we provide extended payment terms to some of our customers in our metal container business due to the seasonality of the vegetable and fruit packing process.\nUSE OF CAPITAL\nHistorically, we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns. Our stable and predictable cash flow, generated largely as a result of our long-term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business, supports our financial strategy. We intend to continue using reasonable leverage, supported by our stable cash flows, to make value enhancing acquisitions. In determining reasonable leverage, we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes. In February 2017, we issued $300.0 million of the 4\u00be% Notes, and \u20ac650.0 million of the 3\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes to prepay most of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans and all of our outstanding revolving loans under our 2014 Credit Facility, to repay certain foreign bank revolving and term loans of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and to redeem $220.0 million of the outstanding 5% Notes. In March 2017, we refinanced our 2014 Credit Facility and entered into our Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity dates of our senior secured credit facility, provides additional borrowing capacity for us and provides us with greater flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. In May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement which further extended maturity dates, lowered the margin on borrowings thereunder and provides additional flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. Our Credit Agreement provides us with revolving loans, consisting of a multicurrency revolving loan facility of approximately $1.19 billion and a Canadian revolving loan facility of Cdn $15.0 million. Additionally, our Credit Agreement initially provided us with U.S. $800.0 million of term loans, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for SDS, and Cdn $45.5 million of term loans (all of which have been repaid). In April 2017, we funded the purchase price for SDS with $800.0 million of term loans and $223.8 million of revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In April 2018, we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding 5% Notes ($280.0 million aggregate principal amount) with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. In August 2019, we redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4\u215b% Notes, and used the net proceeds therefrom to repay outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Agreement, including revolving loans used to redeem the 5\u00bd% Notes. In February 2020, we issued an additional $200.0 million of the 4\u215b% Notes and \u20ac500.0 million of the 2\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds of these issuances and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement to prepay all of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans under our Credit Agreement at that time. In June 2020, we funded the purchase price for the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business with $900.0 million of incremental term loans under our Credit Agreement. In February 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.4% Notes. We used the gross proceeds from such issuance to prepay a portion of our outstanding term loans under our Credit Agreement. You should also read Notes 3, 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nTo the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods, our interest expense may increase. Further, since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates, our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and, accordingly, our interest expense may vary from period to period. After taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations, at December 31, 2020, we had $825.8 million of\nindebtedness, or approximately 26 percent of our total outstanding indebtedness, which bore interest at floating rates. Over the course of the year, we also borrow revolving loans under our revolving loan facilities which bear interest at floating rates to fund our seasonal working capital needs. Accordingly, during 2020 our average outstanding variable rate debt, after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements, was approximately 30 percent of our total outstanding indebtedness. You should also read Notes 10 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements.\nIn light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt as a percentage of our income before interest and income taxes was 20.3 percent, 29.4 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales for each of the periods presented.

2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(3)Includes rationalization charges of $0.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.8 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(4)Includes costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million and $1.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2020 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019\nOverview. Consolidated net sales were $4.92 billion in 2020, representing an 9.6 percent increase as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes in each of the businesses including from acquisitions and a more favorable mix of products sold in the closures business, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs in each of the businesses, the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019 in the metal container business, a less favorable mix of products sold in the plastic container business and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Income before interest and income taxes for 2020 increased by $152.9 million, or 42.5 percent, as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes and strong operating performance in each of the businesses, lower rationalization charges, higher pension income and a more favorable mix of products sold in the closures business, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of higher acquisition related costs, the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts in the metal container business, the negative impact from the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020 and the unfavorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of higher resin costs. Rationalization charges were $16.0 million and $56.3 million for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. Results for 2020 and 2019 also included other pension and post retirement income of $38.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Net income in 2020 was $308.7 million as compared to $193.8 million in 2019.\nNet Sales. The $432.0 million increase in consolidated net sales in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to higher net sales across all businesses.\nNet sales for the metal container business increased $84.8 million, or 3.4 percent, in 2020 as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily a result of higher unit volumes of approximately fourteen percent and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $4.0 million, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs, a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the impact from the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019. Record unit volumes in 2020 resulted primarily from higher demand in at-home food consumption.\nNet sales for the closures business in 2020 increased $306.8 million, or 21.8 percent, as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily the result of higher unit volumes of approximately eight percent and a more favorable mix of products sold due primarily to strong unit volume growth in dispensing closures, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately\n$4 million. The increase in unit volumes was principally the result of the inclusion of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics which were acquired in 2020 and strength in volumes for consumer health, hygiene, personal care and food and beverage products. These volume gains were partially offset by weaker demand for certain beauty and fragrance products.\nNet sales for the plastic container business in 2020 increased $40.4 million, or 6.6 percent, as compared to 2019. This increase was principally due to higher volumes of approximately eleven percent, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs, a less favorable mix of products sold and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $1.0 million. The increase in volumes was due primarily to higher demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products and continued new business awards.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points to 17.6 percent in 2020 as compared to 15.9 percent in 2019 for the reasons discussed below in \"Income before Interest and Income Taxes.\"\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 0.7 percentage points to 7.7 percent for 2020 as compared to 7.0 percent in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.0 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million, the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses from the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics, one-time plant employee incentive payments and a charge of $3.2 million in the plastic container business for the resolution of a non-commercial legal dispute relating to prior periods.\nIncome before Interest and Income Taxes. Income before interest and income taxes for 2020 increased by $152.9 million as compared to 2019, and margin increased to 10.4 percent from 8.0 percent over the same periods. The increase in income before interest and income taxes was primarily the result of higher segment income in each of the businesses and lower rationalization charges, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and the $3.5 million charge for the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020. Income before interest and income taxes included rationalization charges of $16.0 million and $56.3 million and costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million and $1.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment income of the metal container business for 2020 increased $86.6 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 9.6 percent from 6.5 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to higher unit volumes, $39.5 million of lower rationalization charges, strong operating performance and higher pension income. These increases were partially offset by the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019. Rationalization charges were $9.9 million and $49.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Rationalization charges in 2019 were incurred primarily in connection with the shutdown of two manufacturing facilities and the resulting withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan.\nSegment income of the closures business for 2020 increased $50.9 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 13.1 percent from 12.3 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily due to higher unit volumes including from acquisitions completed in 2020, a more favorable mix of products sold, strong operating performance and higher pension income, partially offset by the negative impact of a $3.5 million charge for the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020.\nSegment income of the plastic container business for 2020 increased $38.9 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 13.5 percent from 8.0 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to higher volumes, strong operating performance and lower manufacturing costs and higher pension income, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a charge of $3.2 million for the resolution of a non-commercial legal dispute relating to prior periods and the unfavorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of higher resin costs.\nInterest and Other Debt Expense. Interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2020 was $103.8 million, a decrease of $1.9 million as compared to $105.7 million for 2019 due primarily to lower weighted average interest rates, partially offset by higher average outstanding borrowings principally related to the acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and additional revolving loan borrowings outstanding during the first half of 2020 primarily to hold cash and cash equivalents to ensure liquidity against potential credit market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted average interest rates were lower during 2020 due to lower variable market rates and the redemption on August 1, 2019 of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes. Loss on early\nextinguishment of debt of $1.5 million in 2020 was a result of the prepayment of term loans under our Credit Agreement. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million in 2019 was a result of the redemption of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes in August 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 24.2 percent and 23.1 percent. The effective tax rate in 2019 was favorably impacted by the resolution of a prior year tax audit and the timing of certain tax deductions.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018\nOverview. Consolidated net sales were $4.49 billion in 2019, representing an 0.9 percent increase as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs in the metal container business and higher volumes in the plastic container business, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, lower unit volumes and a less favorable mix of products sold in the metal container and closures businesses and the pass through of lower raw material costs in the plastic container and closures businesses. Income before interest and income taxes for 2019 decreased by $52.6 million, or 12.8 percent, as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of $50.0 million of higher rationalization charges incurred principally in connection with the announced footprint optimization plan for the metal container business and the resulting withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan, lower pension income, lower unit volumes and a less favorable mix of products sold in the metal container and closures businesses, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation and costs attributed to announced acquisitions. These decreases were partially offset by production efficiencies, lower manufacturing costs, higher volumes in the plastic container business, the favorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of lower resin costs in the closures business as compared to an unfavorable impact from higher resin costs in the prior year and the prior year unfavorable impact of costs associated with the start-up of a new manufacturing facility in the plastic container business. Rationalization charges were $56.3 million and $6.3 million for the years ended 2019 and 2018, respectively. Results for 2019 and 2018 also included other pension and post retirement income of $17.8 million and $37.0 million, respectively, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively. Net income in 2019 was $193.8 million as compared to $224.0 million in 2018.\nNet Sales. The $41.0 million increase in consolidated net sales in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due to higher net sales in the metal container business, partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the closures and plastic container businesses.\nNet sales for the metal container business increased $95.2 million, or 4.0 percent, in 2019 as compared to 2018. This increase was primarily a result of the pass through of higher raw material and other manufacturing costs, partially offset by lower unit volumes of approximately one percent, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $16.0 million and a less favorable mix of products sold. The decrease in unit volumes was primarily due to the unfavorable impact in the current year period of the fourth quarter 2018 pre-buy of products by customers in anticipation of significant metal inflation in 2019 and lower volumes with fruit and vegetable pack customers, partially offset by continued growth in pet food volumes as well as higher volumes for soup.\nNet sales for the closures business in 2019 decreased $51.2 million, or 3.5 percent, as compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily the result of the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $34.0 million, the pass through of net lower raw material costs, a less favorable mix of products sold and lower unit volumes of approximately one percent. The decrease in unit volumes was principally the result of weakness in food markets largely due to lower fruit and vegetable pack yields and the unfavorable impact in the current year period of the fourth quarter 2018 pre-buy of products by customers in anticipation of significant metal inflation in 2019, partially offset by higher dispensing systems unit volumes.\nNet sales for the plastic container business in 2019 decreased $3.0 million, or 0.5 percent, as compared to 2018. This decrease was principally due to the pass through of lower raw material costs and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $3.0 million, partially offset by higher volumes of approximately two percent.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin increased 0.4 percentage points to 15.9 percent in 2019 as compared to 15.5 percent in 2018 for the reasons discussed below in \"Income before Interest and Income Taxes.\"\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 0.1 percentage points to 7.0 percent for 2019 as compared to 6.9 percent in 2018. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018\nprimarily due to inflation in compensation and other costs and $1.8 million of costs attributed to announced acquisitions.\nIncome before Interest and Income Taxes. Income before interest and income taxes for 2019 decreased by $52.6 million as compared to 2018, and margin decreased to 8.0 percent from 9.3 percent over the same periods. The decrease in income before interest and income taxes was primarily the result of higher rationalization charges, lower segment income in the closures business and costs in 2019 attributed to announced acquisitions, partially offset by higher segment income in the plastic container business. Income before interest and income taxes in 2019 and 2018 included rationalization charges of $56.3 million and $6.3 million, respectively.\nSegment income of the metal container business for 2019 decreased $38.8 million as compared to 2018, and segment income margin decreased to 6.5 percent from 8.4 percent over the same periods. The decrease in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to $44.1 million of higher rationalization charges, lower pension income, lower unit volumes and a less favorable mix of products sold. These decreases were partially offset by production efficiencies in the U.S. due in part to the favorable impact from increased production levels during the current year. Rationalization charges in 2019 of $49.4 million were incurred primarily in connection with the previously announced footprint optimization plan and the resulting withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan. Rationalization charges were $5.3 million in 2018.\nSegment income of the closures business for 2019 decreased $16.4 million as compared to 2018, and segment income margin decreased to 12.3 percent from 13.0 percent over the same periods. The decrease in segment income was primarily due to an increase in rationalization charges of $6.3 million principally related to the previously announced shutdown of a metal closures manufacturing facility in Spain, lower pension income, the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation, a less favorable mix of products sold and lower unit volumes, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and the favorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of lower resin costs in the current year as compared to an unfavorable impact from higher resin costs in the prior year.\nSegment income of the plastic container business for 2019 increased $6.3 million as compared to 2018, and segment income margin increased to 8.0 percent from 6.9 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income was primarily attributable to higher volumes, lower manufacturing costs, the prior year unfavorable impact of costs associated with the start-up of the new manufacturing facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas and a more favorable mix of products sold, partially offset by lower pension income.\nInterest and Other Debt Expense. Interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2019 was $105.7 million, a decrease of $10.6 million as compared to $116.3 million for 2018 due primarily to lower average outstanding borrowings as a result of the repayment of debt at the end of 2018, lower weighted average interest rates due in part to the redemption on August 1, 2019 of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million in 2019 was a result of the redemption of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes in August 2019. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million in 2018 was the result of the redemption of all remaining outstanding 5% Notes in April 2018 and the amendment to our Credit Agreement in May 2018.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rates for 2019 and 2018 were 23.1 percent and 23.6 percent.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\nOur principal sources of liquidity have been net cash from operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments, including our senior secured credit facility. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily from our obligations under the indebtedness incurred in connection with our acquisitions and the refinancing of that indebtedness, capital investment in new and existing equipment and the funding of our seasonal working capital needs.\nIn February 2020, we issued an additional $200.0 million of the 4\u215b% Notes and \u20ac500.0 million of the 2\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds from these issuances and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement to prepay all of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans under our Credit Agreement at that time. In June 2020, we funded the purchase price for the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business with $900.0 million of incremental term loans under the Credit Agreement.\nOn November 12, 2019, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4\u215b% Notes and used the net proceeds therefrom to repay outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Agreement, including revolving loans used to redeem the 5\u00bd% Notes.\nOn August 1, 2019, we redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes at a redemption price of 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date. We funded this redemption with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. As a result of this redemption, we recorded a pre-tax charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million in 2019 for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOn April 16, 2018, we redeemed all of our remaining outstanding 5% Notes ($280.0 million aggregate principal amount) at a redemption price of 100 percent of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date. We funded this redemption with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. As a result of this redemption, we recorded a pre-tax charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.4 million in 2018 for the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOn March 24, 2017, we refinanced our 2014 Credit Facility and entered into our Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity dates of our senior secured credit facility, provides additional borrowing capacity for us and provides us with greater flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. On May 30, 2018, we amended our Credit Agreement to further extend maturity dates, lower the margin on borrowings thereunder and provide additional flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. Our Credit Agreement provides us with revolving loans, consisting of a multicurrency revolving loan facility of approximately $1.19 billion and a Canadian revolving loan facility of Cdn $15.0 million. Additionally, our Credit Agreement initially provided us with U.S. $800.0 million of term loans and Cdn $45.0 million of term loans (all of which have been repaid). On June 1, 2020, we borrowed $900.0 million of incremental term loans to fund the purchase price for the acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. As a result of the 2018 amendment to our Credit Agreement, we recorded a pre-tax charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.1 million in 2018.\nYou should also read Notes 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report with regard to our debt.\nIn 2020, we used net proceeds of $1,639.7 million from the issuance of the 2\u00bc% Notes and the additional 4\u215b% Notes and from the incremental term loans borrowed under our Credit Agreement, cash provided by operating activities of $602.5 million and increases in outstanding checks of $5.2 million to fund the purchases of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics for $940.9 million, repayments of long-term debt of $766.2 million, net capital expenditures and other investing activities of $222.3 million, dividends paid on our common stock of $53.6 million, repurchases of our common stock of $42.1 million, net repayments of revolving loans of $12.8 million and debt issuance costs of $10.3 million and to increase cash and cash equivalents (including the positive effect of exchange rate changes of $6.5 million) by $205.7 million.\nIn 2019, we used cash provided by operating activities of $507.3 million and proceeds of $400.0 million from the issuance of the 4\u215b% Notes to fund repayments of long-term debt of $359.4 million, net capital expenditures and other investing activities of $230.1 million, net repayments of revolving loans of $98.2 million, dividends paid on our common stock of $50.8 million, repurchases of our common stock of $27.6 million, decreases in outstanding checks of $4.7 million and debt issuance costs of $4.8 million and to increase cash and cash equivalents (including the negative effect of exchange rate changes of $0.7 million) by $131.0 million.\nIn 2018, we used cash provided by operating activities of $506.5 million and net borrowings of revolving loans of $52.3 million to fund repayments of long-term debt of $286.2 million, net capital expenditures and other investing activities of $189.9 million, dividends paid on our common stock of $44.5 million, repurchases of our common stock of $7.8 million, decreases in outstanding checks of $4.1 million and debt issuance costs of $3.3 million and to increase cash and cash equivalents (including the negative effect of exchange rate changes of $3.7 million) by $19.3 million.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $3,272.0 million of total consolidated indebtedness and cash and cash equivalents on hand of $409.5 million. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit of $15.4 million and no outstanding revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, we have available to us $1.19 billion of revolving loans under a multicurrency revolving loan facility and Cdn $15.0 million under a Canadian revolving loan facility. Revolving loans under our Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and refinancing of other debt. Revolving loans may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed under the revolving loan facilities from time to time until March 24, 2023. At December 31, 2020, after taking into account outstanding letters of credit of $15.4 million, borrowings available under the revolving\nloan facilities of our Credit Agreement were $1.17 billion and Cdn $15.0 million. Under our Credit Agreement, we also have available to us an uncommitted multicurrency incremental loan facility in an amount of up to an additional $1.25 billion (which amount may be increased as provided in our Credit Agreement), which may take the form of one or more incremental term loan facilities, increased commitments under the revolving loan facilities and/or incremental indebtedness in the form of senior secured loans and/or notes, and we may incur additional indebtedness as permitted by our Credit Agreement and our other instruments governing our indebtedness. You should also read Notes 3, 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOn February 10, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.4% Notes at 99.945 percent of their principal amount. We used the gross proceeds from the sale of the 1.4% Notes to prepay $500.0 million of our outstanding term loans under our Credit Agreement. You should also read Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nBecause we sell metal containers and closures used in fruit and vegetable pack processing, we have seasonal sales. As is common in the packaging industry, we must utilize working capital to build inventory and then carry accounts receivable for some customers beyond the end of the packing season. Due to our seasonal requirements, which generally peak sometime in the summer or early fall, we may incur short-term indebtedness to finance our working capital requirements. Our peak seasonal working capital requirements have historically averaged approximately $350.0 million and were generally funded with revolving loans under our senior secured credit facility, other foreign bank loans and cash on hand. For 2021, we expect to fund our seasonal working capital requirements with cash on hand, revolving loans under our Credit Agreement and foreign bank loans. We may use the available portion of revolving loans under our Credit Agreement, after taking into account our seasonal needs and outstanding letters of credit, for other general corporate purposes, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases and refinancing and repayments of other debt.\nWe use a variety of working capital management strategies, including supply chain financing, or SCF, programs. In light of evolving market practices with respect to payment terms, we have entered into various SCF arrangements with financial institutions pursuant to which (i) we sell receivables of certain customers without recourse to such financial institutions and accelerate payment in respect of such receivables sooner than provided in the applicable supply agreements with such customers and (ii) we have effectively extended our payment terms on certain of our payables.\nFor our customer-based SCF arrangements, we negotiate the terms of such SCF arrangements with the applicable financial institutions providing such SCF arrangements independent of our agreements with our customers. Under such SCF arrangements, we elect to sell our receivables for the applicable customer to the applicable financial institution on a non-recourse basis at a discount or credit spread based upon the creditworthiness of such customer. Such customer is then obligated to pay the applicable financial institution with respect to such receivables on their due date. Upon any such sale, we no longer have any credit risk with respect to such receivables, and we will have accelerated our receipt of cash in respect of such receivables thereby reducing our net working capital. Payments in respect of receivables sold under such SCF arrangements are reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Separate from such SCF arrangements, we generally maintain the contractual right with customers in respect of which we have entered into SCF arrangements to require shorter payment terms or require our customers to negotiate shorter payment terms as a result of changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates and general market liquidity, or in some cases for any reason. Approximately 19 percent of our annual net sales in each of 2020 and 2019 were subject to customer-based SCF arrangements. Based on our estimate, we improved our days sales outstanding by approximately twelve days for 2020 as a result of such customer-based SCF arrangements.\nFor our suppliers, we believe that we negotiate the best terms possible, including payment terms. In connection therewith, we initiated a SCF program with a major global financial institution. Under this SCF program, a qualifying supplier may elect, but is not obligated, to sell its receivables from us to such financial institution. A participating supplier negotiates its receivables sale arrangements directly with the financial institution under this SCF program. While we are not party to, and do not participate in the negotiation of, such arrangements, such financial institution allows a participating supplier to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing a credit spread in respect of the sale of its receivables from us as well as other applicable terms. This may provide a supplier with more favorable terms than it would be able to secure on its own. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in this SCF program and reaches an agreement with the financial institution, the supplier independently elects which individual invoices to us that they\nsell to the financial institution. All of our payments to a participating supplier are paid to the financial institution on the invoice due date under our agreement with such supplier, regardless of whether the individual invoice was sold by the supplier to the financial institution. The financial institution then pays the supplier on the invoice due date under our agreement with such supplier for any invoices not previously sold by the supplier to the financial institution. Amounts due to a supplier that elects to participate in this SCF program are included in accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the associated payments are reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Separate from this SCF program, we and suppliers who participate in this SCF program generally maintain the contractual right to require the other to negotiate in good faith the existing payment terms as a result of changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates and general market liquidity, or in some cases for any reason. Approximately 14 and 18 percent of our Cost of Goods Sold in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were subject to this SCF program. At December 31, 2020, outstanding trade accounts payables subject to this SCF program were approximately $225 million.\nCertain economic developments such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the creditworthiness of customers relative to us could impact our participation in customer-based SCF arrangements. Future changes in our suppliers' financing policies or certain economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or our creditworthiness relative to a supplier could impact a supplier's participation in our supplier SCF program and/or our ability to negotiate better payment terms with suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict. If such supply chain financing arrangements ended, our net working capital would likely increase although because of numerous variables we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, and it would be necessary for us to fund such net working capital increase using cash on hand or revolving loans under our Credit Agreement or other indebtedness.\nOn October 17, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by us of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of our common stock by various means from time to time through and including December 31, 2021. Pursuant to this authorization, we repurchased an aggregate of 1,088,263 shares of our common stock in 2020 at an average price per share of $32.96, for a total purchase price of $35.9 million. In 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of 407,540 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $29.70, for a total purchase price of $12.1 million. In 2018 we repurchased a total of 188,300 shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $25.31, for a total purchase price of $4.8 million. Accordingly, at December 31, 2020, we had approximately $76.6 million remaining for the repurchase of our common stock under the October 17, 2016 Board of Directors authorization.\nIn addition to our operating cash needs and excluding any impact from acquisitions, we believe our cash requirements over the next few years will consist primarily of:\n\u2022capital expenditures of approximately $230 million in 2021, and thereafter annual capital expenditures of approximately $200 million to $230 million which may increase as a result of specific growth or specific cost savings projects;\n\u2022principal payments of bank term loans and revolving loans under our Credit Agreement and other outstanding debt agreements and obligations of $26.1 million in 2021, $0.7 million in 2022, $0.7 million in 2023, $400.6 million in 2024, and $2,809.4 million thereafter, which amounts do not give effect to the issuance by us on February 10, 2021 of the 1.4% Notes and the use of the gross proceeds therefrom, except that the maturities of the term loans under our Credit Agreement which were prepaid with such gross proceeds were extended for the purposes of this paragraph to 2026 to match the maturities of the 1.4% Notes;\n\u2022cash payments for quarterly dividends on our common stock as approved by our Board of Directors;\n\u2022annual payments to satisfy employee withholding tax requirements resulting from certain restricted stock units becoming vested, which payments are dependent upon the price of our common stock at the time of vesting and the number of restricted stock units that vest, none of which is estimable at this time (payments in 2020 were not significant);\n\u2022our interest requirements, including interest on revolving loans (the principal amount of which will vary depending upon seasonal requirements) and term loans under our Credit Agreement, which bear fluctuating rates of interest, the 4\u00be% Notes, the 3\u00bc% Notes, the 4\u215b% Notes, the 2\u00bc% Notes and the 1.4% Notes;\n\u2022payments of approximately $110 million to $120 million for federal, state and foreign tax liabilities in 2021, which may increase annually thereafter; and\n\u2022payments for pension benefit plan contributions, which are not expected to be significant based on the fact that our domestic pension plans were more than 100 percent funded at December 31, 2020.\nWe believe that cash generated from operations and funds from borrowings available under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to meet our expected operating needs, planned capital expenditures, debt service requirements (both principal and interest), tax obligations, pension benefit plan contributions, share repurchases required under our Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and common stock dividends for the foreseeable future. We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market and may incur additional indebtedness, including indebtedness under our Credit Agreement, to finance any such acquisition.\nOur Credit Agreement contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt, sell assets and engage in certain transactions. The indentures governing the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes, the 4\u215b% Notes, the 2\u00bc% Notes and the 1.4% Notes contain certain covenants that generally restrict our ability to create liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, issue guarantees and consolidate, merge or sell assets. We do not expect these limitations to have a material effect on our business or our results of operations. We are in compliance with all financial and operating covenants contained in our financing agreements and believe that we will continue to be in compliance during 2021 with all of these covenants.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2020 are provided below:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nyears </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Dollars in millions) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,237.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,496.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,713.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on fixed rate debt(1)\n</td> <td>447.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on variable rate debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td>78.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>259.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>40.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(4)\n</td> <td>29.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other pension and postretirement\nbenefit obligations(5)\n</td> <td>73.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(6)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,164.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,736.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,919.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)These amounts do not give effect to the issuance by us on February 10, 2021 of the 1.4% Notes and the use of the gross proceeds therefrom, except that the maturities of the term loans under our Credit Agreement which were prepaid with such gross proceeds were extended for purposes of the table above to match the maturities of the 1.4% Notes. See \"-Capital Resources and Liquidity.\"\n(2)These amounts represent expected cash payments of interest on our variable rate long-term debt under our Credit Agreement, after taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreements, at prevailing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2020.\n(3)Operating and finance lease obligations include imputed interest.\n(4)Purchase obligations represent commitments for capital expenditures of $29.8 million. Obligations that are cancelable without penalty are excluded.\n(5)Other pension obligations consist of annual cash expenditures for the withdrawal liability related to the Central States Pension Plan through 2040 and other postretirement benefit obligations which have been actuarially determined through the year 2030.\n(6)Based on current legislation and the current funded status of our domestic pension benefit plans, there are no significant minimum required contributions to our pension benefit plans in 2021.\nAt December 31, 2020, we also had outstanding letters of credit of $15.4 million that were issued under our Credit Agreement.\nYou should also read Notes 4, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nEFFECT OF INFLATION AND INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS\nHistorically, inflation has not had a material effect on us, other than to increase our cost of borrowing. In general, we have been able to increase the sales prices of our products to reflect any increases in the prices of raw materials (subject to contractual lag periods) and to significantly reduce the exposure of our results of operations to increases in other costs, such as labor and other manufacturing costs.\nBecause we have indebtedness which bears interest at floating rates, our financial results will be sensitive to changes in prevailing market rates of interest. As of December 31, 2020, we had $3,272.0 million of indebtedness outstanding, of which $925.8 million bore interest at floating rates. Historically, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations. During 2018, we entered into two U.S. dollar interest rate swap agreements, each for $50.0 million notional principal amount, that were effective in 2019 and mature in 2023. Depending upon future market conditions and our level of outstanding variable rate debt, we may enter into additional interest rate swap or hedge agreements (with counterparties that, in our judgment, have sufficient creditworthiness) to hedge our exposure against interest rate volatility.\nRATIONALIZATION CHARGES\nIn June 2019, we announced a footprint optimization plan for our metal container business, which included the closing of our metal container manufacturing facilities in Mt. Vernon, Missouri and Waupun, Wisconsin in the fourth quarter of 2019. These plant closings, in conjunction with the prior ratification of a new labor agreement at our Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin metal container manufacturing facility that provided for the withdrawal for that facility from the Central States Pension Plan, resulted in our complete withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan. We estimate net rationalization charges for this plan of $3.5 million for the plant closings and $62.0 million for the withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan. We recorded total rationalization charges for this plan of $4.1 million and $46.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, largely to recognize the present value of the estimated withdrawal liability related to the Central States Pension Plan. Remaining expenses and cash expenditures for the plant closings are not expected to be significant. Remaining expenses for the accretion of interest for the withdrawal liability related to the Central States Pension Plan are expected to average approximately $1.1 million per year and be recognized annually through 2040, and remaining cash expenditures for the withdrawal liability related to the Central States Pension Plan are expected to be approximately $3.1 million annually through 2040.\nWe continually evaluate cost reduction opportunities across each of our businesses, including rationalizations of our existing facilities through plant closings and downsizings. We use a disciplined approach to identify opportunities that generate attractive cash returns. Under our rationalization plans, we made cash payments of $13.0 million, $8.7 million and $2.2 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Exclusive of the footprint optimization plan for our metal container business and withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan as discussed above, additional remaining cash spending under our rationalization plans are expected to be $3.9 million. You should also read Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles require estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Some of these estimates and assumptions require difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. We believe that our accounting policies for pension expense and obligations and rationalization charges and testing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment reflect the more significant judgments and estimates in our consolidated financial statements. You should also read our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOur pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations. Two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long-term return on plan assets. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually. Other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement, mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience. Actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions. The discount rate represents the market rate for non-callable high-quality fixed income investments and is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension benefit plans. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense, while an increase in the discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would have a countervailing impact on our annual pension expense by approximately $2.1 million. For 2020, we decreased our domestic discount rate to 2.5 percent from 3.4 percent to reflect market interest rate conditions. We consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension benefit plans, as well as historical and expected long-term rates of return on those types of plan assets, in determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would have a countervailing impact on our annual pension expense by approximately $2.4 million. Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets will remain at 8.5 percent in 2021.\nHistorically, we have maintained a strategy of acquiring businesses and enhancing profitability through productivity and cost reduction opportunities. Acquisitions require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transactions. These estimates of fair value are based on market participant perspectives when available and our business plans for the acquired entities, which include eliminating operating redundancies, facility closings and rationalizations and assumptions as to the ultimate resolution of liabilities assumed. We also continually evaluate the operating performance of our existing facilities and our business requirements and, when deemed appropriate, we exit or rationalize existing operating facilities. Establishing reserves for acquisition plans and facility rationalizations requires the use of estimates. Although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of these plans, actual costs incurred may differ from these estimates.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year and more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. Our tests for goodwill impairment require us to make certain assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting units. In 2020, we calculated the fair value of our reporting units using the market approach, which required us to estimate future expected earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and estimate EBITDA market multiples using publicly available information for each of our reporting units. Developing these assumptions requires the use of significant judgment and estimates. Actual results may differ from these forecasts. If an impairment were to be identified, it could result in additional expense recorded in our consolidated statements of income.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe statements we have made in Risk Factors\u201d and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements\u201d made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis.\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading manufacturer of rigid packaging for consumer goods products. We currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and general line products; dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care and beauty products; and custom designed plastic containers for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical products. We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in North America with a unit volume market share in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2020 of slightly more than half of the market, a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care and beauty products, and a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in North America for a variety of markets, including the personal care, food, health care and household and industrial chemical markets.\nOur objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, reduce operating costs, build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. We have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth, and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market.\nSALES GROWTH\nWe have increased net sales and market share in our metal container, closures and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth. As a result, we have expanded and diversified our customer base, geographic presence and product lines.\nWe are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, primarily as a result of our acquisitions but also as a result of growth with existing customers. During approximately the past three decades, the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self-manufacture their metal food containers. Our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of Nestl\u00e9, Dial, Del Monte, Birds Eye, Campbell, Pacific Coast and Purina Steel Can reflect this trend. We estimate that approximately eight percent of the market for metal food containers in the United States is still served by self-manufacturers. Prior to 2020, the metal food container market in North America was relatively flat during this period of consolidation, despite losing market share as a result of more dining out, fresh produce and competing materials. Despite a relatively flat market, we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the United States primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers. We also enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value-added features such as our Quick Top\u00ae easy-open ends, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In 2020, we experienced a significant increase in demand for many of our products, including metal food containers. Our unit volumes for metal food containers increased approximately 14 percent in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher demand in at-home food consumption. For 2021, we anticipate that demand levels for our metal food containers will continue to be strong principally due to continued higher demand in at-home food consumption.\nWith our acquisitions of our closures operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, and beauty products. In 2017, we broadened our closures portfolio to include dispensing systems with our acquisition of SDS and in 2020, we further expanded our dispensing systems operations with our acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, net sales of our closures business have increased to $1.71 billion in 2020 as a result of acquisitions and internal growth, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.2 percent over that period. We may pursue further acquisition opportunities in the closures markets in which we operate, including in dispensing systems, or in adjacent closures markets, such as our acquisitions of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics. Additionally, we expect to continue to\ngenerate internal growth in our closures business, particularly in plastic closures and dispensing systems. In 2020, unit volumes for our closures business increased approximately 8 percent principally as a result of the acquisitions we completed in 2020 and strong volumes for consumer health, hygiene, personal care, food and beverage products. For 2021, we expect demand levels for consumer health, hygiene, personal care, food and beverage products to continue to be strong. Additionally, 2021 will include a full year of volumes from our acquisitions completed in 2020.\nWe have improved the market position of our plastic container business since 1987, with net sales increasing to $651.5 million in 2020, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.2 percent over that period. We achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth. Since 2016, we have made strategic investments to enhance the competitive position of our plastic container business, including the construction of three new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. The plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented, with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials. We have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care. We intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value-added operating expertise and strategy. In 2020, our plastic container business realized a significant increase in volumes of approximately 11 percent primarily due to higher demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products and continued new business awards. We anticipate that demand levels for our plastic containers will continue to be strong in 2021, driven largely by new business awards and continued high demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products.\nOPERATING PERFORMANCE\nWe operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure. We have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions and the optimization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. Our acquisitions and investments have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling. From 2015, we have closed six metal container manufacturing facilities, two closures manufacturing facility and three plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations, reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand. In 2019, we initiated a multi-year footprint optimization plan in our metal container business in the U.S. to reduce capacity and continue to drive cost reductions. As part of this plan, we shut down two metal container manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019. We delayed further implementation of this footprint optimization plan in 2020 due to a strong increase in demand for our products.\nWe have also invested substantial capital in the past several years for new market opportunities and value-added products such as Quick Top\u00ae easy-open ends for metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2016, we completed optimization plans in each of our businesses that reduced manufacturing and logistical costs and provided productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets. In conjunction with these optimization plans, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities. The three new manufacturing facilities are strategically located to meet the unique needs of our customers. In addition to optimizing freight and logistical costs, these three new facilities allowed us to further reduce costs and rationalize our manufacturing footprint. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a new metal container manufacturing facility and a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility, in each case to support continued growth in key markets.\nHistorically, we have been successful in renewing our multi-year supply arrangements with our customers. We estimate that in 2021 approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales and a majority of our projected closures and plastic containers sales will be under multi-year arrangements.\nMany of our multi-year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material, labor and other manufacturing costs, thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs. Our metal container and metal closure supply agreements with our\ncustomers provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our metal container and metal closure customers without long-term contracts, we have also generally changed prices to pass through changes in our metal costs. Our plastic closure, dispensing systems and plastic container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our resin costs, subject in many cases to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For our plastic closure, dispensing systems and plastic container customers without long-term contracts, we have also generally passed through changes in our resin costs.\nOur metal container business' sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. Our closures business is also dependent, in part, upon vegetable and fruit harvests. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter. Additionally, as is common in the packaging industry, we provide extended payment terms to some of our customers in our metal container business due to the seasonality of the vegetable and fruit packing process.\nUSE OF CAPITAL\nHistorically, we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns. Our stable and predictable cash flow, generated largely as a result of our long-term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business, supports our financial strategy. We intend to continue using reasonable leverage, supported by our stable cash flows, to make value enhancing acquisitions. In determining reasonable leverage, we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes. In February 2017, we issued $300.0 million of the 4\u00be% Notes, and \u20ac650.0 million of the 3\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes to prepay most of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans and all of our outstanding revolving loans under our 2014 Credit Facility, to repay certain foreign bank revolving and term loans of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and to redeem $220.0 million of the outstanding 5% Notes. In March 2017, we refinanced our 2014 Credit Facility and entered into our Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity dates of our senior secured credit facility, provides additional borrowing capacity for us and provides us with greater flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. In May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement which further extended maturity dates, lowered the margin on borrowings thereunder and provides additional flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. Our Credit Agreement provides us with revolving loans, consisting of a multicurrency revolving loan facility of approximately $1.19 billion and a Canadian revolving loan facility of Cdn $15.0 million. Additionally, our Credit Agreement initially provided us with U.S. $800.0 million of term loans, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for SDS, and Cdn $45.5 million of term loans (all of which have been repaid). In April 2017, we funded the purchase price for SDS with $800.0 million of term loans and $223.8 million of revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In April 2018, we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding 5% Notes ($280.0 million aggregate principal amount) with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. In August 2019, we redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4\u215b% Notes, and used the net proceeds therefrom to repay outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Agreement, including revolving loans used to redeem the 5\u00bd% Notes. In February 2020, we issued an additional $200.0 million of the 4\u215b% Notes and \u20ac500.0 million of the 2\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds of these issuances and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement to prepay all of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans under our Credit Agreement at that time. In June 2020, we funded the purchase price for the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business with $900.0 million of incremental term loans under our Credit Agreement. In February 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.4% Notes. We used the gross proceeds from such issuance to prepay a portion of our outstanding term loans under our Credit Agreement. You should also read Notes 3, 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nTo the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods, our interest expense may increase. Further, since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates, our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and, accordingly, our interest expense may vary from period to period. After taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations, at December 31, 2020, we had $825.8 million of\nindebtedness, or approximately 26 percent of our total outstanding indebtedness, which bore interest at floating rates. Over the course of the year, we also borrow revolving loans under our revolving loan facilities which bear interest at floating rates to fund our seasonal working capital needs. Accordingly, during 2020 our average outstanding variable rate debt, after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements, was approximately 30 percent of our total outstanding indebtedness.

For 2020, 2019 and 2018, our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt as a percentage of our income before interest and income taxes was 20.3 percent, 29.4 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales for each of the periods presented.

Consolidated net sales were $4.92 billion in 2020, representing an 9.6 percent increase as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes in each of the businesses including from acquisitions and a more favorable mix of products sold in the closures business, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs in each of the businesses, the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019 in the metal container business, a less favorable mix of products sold in the plastic container business and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Income before interest and income taxes for 2020 increased by $152.9 million, or 42.5 percent, as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes and strong operating performance in each of the businesses, lower rationalization charges, higher pension income and a more favorable mix of products sold in the closures business, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of higher acquisition related costs, the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts in the metal container business, the negative impact from the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020 and the unfavorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of higher resin costs. Rationalization charges were $16.0 million and $56.3 million for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. Results for 2020 and 2019 also included other pension and post retirement income of $38.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Net income in 2020 was $308.7 million as compared to $193.8 million in 2019.\nNet Sales. The $432.0 million increase in consolidated net sales in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to higher net sales across all businesses.\nNet sales for the metal container business increased $84.8 million, or 3.4 percent, in 2020 as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily a result of higher unit volumes of approximately fourteen percent and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $4.0 million, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs, a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the impact from the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019. Record unit volumes in 2020 resulted primarily from higher demand in at-home food consumption.\nNet sales for the closures business in 2020 increased $306.8 million, or 21.8 percent, as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily the result of higher unit volumes of approximately eight percent and a more favorable mix of products sold due primarily to strong unit volume growth in dispensing closures, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately\n$4 million. The increase in unit volumes was principally the result of the inclusion of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics which were acquired in 2020 and strength in volumes for consumer health, hygiene, personal care and food and beverage products. These volume gains were partially offset by weaker demand for certain beauty and fragrance products.\nNet sales for the plastic container business in 2020 increased $40.4 million, or 6.6 percent, as compared to 2019. This increase was principally due to higher volumes of approximately eleven percent, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs, a less favorable mix of products sold and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $1.0 million. The increase in volumes was due primarily to higher demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products and continued new business awards.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points to 17.6 percent in 2020 as compared to 15.9 percent in 2019 for the reasons discussed below in \"Income before Interest and Income Taxes.\"\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 0.7 percentage points to 7.7 percent for 2020 as compared to 7.0 percent in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.0 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million, the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses from the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics, one-time plant employee incentive payments and a charge of $3.2 million in the plastic container business for the resolution of a non-commercial legal dispute relating to prior periods.\nIncome before Interest and Income Taxes. Income before interest and income taxes for 2020 increased by $152.9 million as compared to 2019, and margin increased to 10.4 percent from 8.0 percent over the same periods. The increase in income before interest and income taxes was primarily the result of higher segment income in each of the businesses and lower rationalization charges, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and the $3.5 million charge for the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020. Income before interest and income taxes included rationalization charges of $16.0 million and $56.3 million and costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million and $1.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment income of the metal container business for 2020 increased $86.6 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 9.6 percent from 6.5 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to higher unit volumes, $39.5 million of lower rationalization charges, strong operating performance and higher pension income. These increases were partially offset by the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019. Rationalization charges were $9.9 million and $49.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Rationalization charges in 2019 were incurred primarily in connection with the shutdown of two manufacturing facilities and the resulting withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan.\nSegment income of the closures business for 2020 increased $50.9 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 13.1 percent from 12.3 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily due to higher unit volumes including from acquisitions completed in 2020, a more favorable mix of products sold, strong operating performance and higher pension income, partially offset by the negative impact of a $3.5 million charge for the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020.\nSegment income of the plastic container business for 2020 increased $38.9 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 13.5 percent from 8.0 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to higher volumes, strong operating performance and lower manufacturing costs and higher pension income, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a charge of $3.2 million for the resolution of a non-commercial legal dispute relating to prior periods and the unfavorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of higher resin costs.\nInterest and Other Debt Expense. Interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2020 was $103.8 million, a decrease of $1.9 million as compared to $105.7 million for 2019 due primarily to lower weighted average interest rates, partially offset by higher average outstanding borrowings principally related to the acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and additional revolving loan borrowings outstanding during the first half of 2020 primarily to hold cash and cash equivalents to ensure liquidity against potential credit market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted average interest rates were lower during 2020 due to lower variable market rates and the redemption on August 1, 2019 of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes. Loss on early\nextinguishment of debt of $1.5 million in 2020 was a result of the prepayment of term loans under our Credit Agreement. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million in 2019 was a result of the redemption of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes in August 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 24.2 percent and 23.1 percent. The effective tax rate in 2019 was favorably impacted by the resolution of a prior year tax audit and the timing of certain tax deductions.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018\nOverview. Consolidated net sales were $4.49 billion in 2019, representing an 0.9 percent increase as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the pass through of higher", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to assist you in understanding our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three-year period ended December 31, 2020. Our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report contain detailed information that you should refer to in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis.\nGENERAL\nWe are a leading manufacturer of rigid packaging for consumer goods products. We currently produce steel and aluminum containers for human and pet food and general line products; dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care and beauty products; and custom designed plastic containers for personal care, food, health care, pharmaceutical, household and industrial chemical, pet food and care, agricultural, automotive and marine chemical products. We are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, the largest manufacturer of metal food containers in North America with a unit volume market share in the United States for the year ended December 31, 2020 of slightly more than half of the market, a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care and beauty products, and a leading manufacturer of plastic containers in North America for a variety of markets, including the personal care, food, health care and household and industrial chemical markets.\nOur objective is to increase shareholder value by efficiently deploying capital and management resources to grow our business, reduce operating costs, build sustainable competitive positions, or franchises, and to complete acquisitions that generate attractive cash returns. We have grown our net sales and income from operations largely through acquisitions but also through internal growth, and we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in the consumer goods packaging market.\nSALES GROWTH\nWe have increased net sales and market share in our metal container, closures and plastic container businesses through both acquisitions and internal growth. As a result, we have expanded and diversified our customer base, geographic presence and product lines.\nWe are a leading manufacturer of metal containers in North America and Europe, primarily as a result of our acquisitions but also as a result of growth with existing customers. During approximately the past three decades, the metal food container market has experienced significant consolidation primarily due to the desire by food processors to reduce costs and focus resources on their core operations rather than self-manufacture their metal food containers. Our acquisitions of the metal food container manufacturing operations of Nestl\u00e9, Dial, Del Monte, Birds Eye, Campbell, Pacific Coast and Purina Steel Can reflect this trend. We estimate that approximately eight percent of the market for metal food containers in the United States is still served by self-manufacturers. Prior to 2020, the metal food container market in North America was relatively flat during this period of consolidation, despite losing market share as a result of more dining out, fresh produce and competing materials. Despite a relatively flat market, we increased our share of the market for metal food containers in the United States primarily through acquisitions and growth with existing customers. We also enhanced our business by focusing on providing customers with high levels of quality and service and value-added features such as our Quick Top\u00ae easy-open ends, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In 2020, we experienced a significant increase in demand for many of our products, including metal food containers. Our unit volumes for metal food containers increased approximately 14 percent in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to higher demand in at-home food consumption. For 2021, we anticipate that demand levels for our metal food containers will continue to be strong principally due to continued higher demand in at-home food consumption.\nWith our acquisitions of our closures operations in North America, Europe, Asia and South America, we established ourselves as a leading worldwide manufacturer of dispensing systems and metal and plastic closures for food, beverage, health care, garden, home, personal care, and beauty products. In 2017, we broadened our closures portfolio to include dispensing systems with our acquisition of SDS and in 2020, we further expanded our dispensing systems operations with our acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business. Since 2003, following our acquisition of the White Cap closures operations in the United States, net sales of our closures business have increased to $1.71 billion in 2020 as a result of acquisitions and internal growth, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 13.2 percent over that period. We may pursue further acquisition opportunities in the closures markets in which we operate, including in dispensing systems, or in adjacent closures markets, such as our acquisitions of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics. Additionally, we expect to continue to\ngenerate internal growth in our closures business, particularly in plastic closures and dispensing systems. In 2020, unit volumes for our closures business increased approximately 8 percent principally as a result of the acquisitions we completed in 2020 and strong volumes for consumer health, hygiene, personal care, food and beverage products. For 2021, we expect demand levels for consumer health, hygiene, personal care, food and beverage products to continue to be strong. Additionally, 2021 will include a full year of volumes from our acquisitions completed in 2020.\nWe have improved the market position of our plastic container business since 1987, with net sales increasing to $651.5 million in 2020, representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 6.2 percent over that period. We achieved this improved market position primarily through strategic acquisitions as well as through internal growth. Since 2016, we have made strategic investments to enhance the competitive position of our plastic container business, including the construction of three new plastic container manufacturing facilities in the United States to meet the growing needs of our customers and allow us to further reduce costs of our plastic container business. The plastic container market of the consumer goods packaging industry continues to be highly fragmented, with growth rates in excess of population expansion due to substitution of plastic for other materials. We have focused on the segment of this market where custom design and decoration allows customers to differentiate their products such as in personal care. We intend to pursue further acquisition opportunities in markets where we believe that we can successfully apply our acquisition and value-added operating expertise and strategy. In 2020, our plastic container business realized a significant increase in volumes of approximately 11 percent primarily due to higher demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products and continued new business awards. We anticipate that demand levels for our plastic containers will continue to be strong in 2021, driven largely by new business awards and continued high demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products.\nOPERATING PERFORMANCE\nWe operate in a competitive industry where it is necessary to realize cost reduction opportunities to offset continued competitive pricing pressure. We have improved the operating performance of our plant facilities through the investment of capital for productivity improvements, manufacturing efficiencies, manufacturing cost reductions and the optimization of our manufacturing facilities footprints. Our acquisitions and investments have enabled us to rationalize plant operations and decrease overhead costs through plant closings and downsizings and to realize manufacturing efficiencies as a result of optimizing production scheduling. From 2015, we have closed six metal container manufacturing facilities, two closures manufacturing facility and three plastic container manufacturing facilities in connection with our continuing efforts to streamline our plant operations, reduce operating costs and better match supply with geographic demand. In 2019, we initiated a multi-year footprint optimization plan in our metal container business in the U.S. to reduce capacity and continue to drive cost reductions. As part of this plan, we shut down two metal container manufacturing facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019. We delayed further implementation of this footprint optimization plan in 2020 due to a strong increase in demand for our products.\nWe have also invested substantial capital in the past several years for new market opportunities and value-added products such as Quick Top\u00ae easy-open ends for metal food containers, shaped metal food containers and alternative color offerings for metal food containers. In addition, we have made and continue to make investments to enhance the competitive advantages of metal packaging for food. In 2016, we completed optimization plans in each of our businesses that reduced manufacturing and logistical costs and provided productivity improvements and manufacturing efficiencies, thereby resulting in a lower cost manufacturing network for our businesses and strengthening the competitive position of each of our businesses in their respective markets. In conjunction with these optimization plans, we completed the construction of a new metal food container manufacturing facility and two new plastic container manufacturing facilities, the relocation of various equipment lines to facilities where we can better serve our customers and the rationalization of several existing manufacturing facilities. The three new manufacturing facilities are strategically located to meet the unique needs of our customers. In addition to optimizing freight and logistical costs, these three new facilities allowed us to further reduce costs and rationalize our manufacturing footprint. Additionally, in 2018 we commercialized a new metal container manufacturing facility and a new thermoformed plastic container manufacturing facility, in each case to support continued growth in key markets.\nHistorically, we have been successful in renewing our multi-year supply arrangements with our customers. We estimate that in 2021 approximately 90 percent of our projected metal container sales and a majority of our projected closures and plastic containers sales will be under multi-year arrangements.\nMany of our multi-year customer supply arrangements generally provide for the pass through of changes in raw material, labor and other manufacturing costs, thereby significantly reducing the exposure of our results of operations to the volatility of these costs. Our metal container and metal closure supply agreements with our\ncustomers provide for the pass through of changes in our metal costs. For our metal container and metal closure customers without long-term contracts, we have also generally changed prices to pass through changes in our metal costs. Our plastic closure, dispensing systems and plastic container supply agreements with our customers provide for the pass through of changes in our resin costs, subject in many cases to a lag in the timing of such pass through. For our plastic closure, dispensing systems and plastic container customers without long-term contracts, we have also generally passed through changes in our resin costs.\nOur metal container business' sales and income from operations are dependent, in part, upon the vegetable and fruit harvests in the midwest and western regions of the United States and, to a lesser extent, in a variety of national growing regions in Europe. Our closures business is also dependent, in part, upon vegetable and fruit harvests. The size and quality of these harvests varies from year to year, depending in large part upon the weather conditions in applicable regions. Because of the seasonality of the harvests, we have historically experienced higher unit sales volume in the third quarter of our fiscal year and generated a disproportionate amount of our annual income from operations during that quarter. Additionally, as is common in the packaging industry, we provide extended payment terms to some of our customers in our metal container business due to the seasonality of the vegetable and fruit packing process.\nUSE OF CAPITAL\nHistorically, we have used leverage to support our growth and increase shareholder returns. Our stable and predictable cash flow, generated largely as a result of our long-term customer relationships and generally recession resistant business, supports our financial strategy. We intend to continue using reasonable leverage, supported by our stable cash flows, to make value enhancing acquisitions. In determining reasonable leverage, we evaluate our cost of capital and manage our level of debt to maintain an optimal cost of capital based on current market conditions. If acquisition opportunities are not identified over a longer period of time, we may use our cash flow to repay debt, repurchase shares of our common stock or increase dividends to our stockholders or for other permitted purposes. In February 2017, we issued $300.0 million of the 4\u00be% Notes, and \u20ac650.0 million of the 3\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 4\u00be% Notes and the 3\u00bc% Notes to prepay most of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans and all of our outstanding revolving loans under our 2014 Credit Facility, to repay certain foreign bank revolving and term loans of certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries and to redeem $220.0 million of the outstanding 5% Notes. In March 2017, we refinanced our 2014 Credit Facility and entered into our Credit Agreement, which extended the maturity dates of our senior secured credit facility, provides additional borrowing capacity for us and provides us with greater flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. In May 2018, we entered into an amendment to our Credit Agreement which further extended maturity dates, lowered the margin on borrowings thereunder and provides additional flexibility with regard to our strategic initiatives. Our Credit Agreement provides us with revolving loans, consisting of a multicurrency revolving loan facility of approximately $1.19 billion and a Canadian revolving loan facility of Cdn $15.0 million. Additionally, our Credit Agreement initially provided us with U.S. $800.0 million of term loans, which were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for SDS, and Cdn $45.5 million of term loans (all of which have been repaid). In April 2017, we funded the purchase price for SDS with $800.0 million of term loans and $223.8 million of revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement. In April 2018, we redeemed all of the remaining outstanding 5% Notes ($280.0 million aggregate principal amount) with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. In August 2019, we redeemed all $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes with revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement and cash on hand. In November 2019, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4\u215b% Notes, and used the net proceeds therefrom to repay outstanding revolving loans under our Credit Agreement, including revolving loans used to redeem the 5\u00bd% Notes. In February 2020, we issued an additional $200.0 million of the 4\u215b% Notes and \u20ac500.0 million of the 2\u00bc% Notes. We used the net proceeds of these issuances and revolving loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement to prepay all of our outstanding U.S. dollar term loans under our Credit Agreement at that time. In June 2020, we funded the purchase price for the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business with $900.0 million of incremental term loans under our Credit Agreement. In February 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.4% Notes. We used the gross proceeds from such issuance to prepay a portion of our outstanding term loans under our Credit Agreement. You should also read Notes 3, 9 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nTo the extent we utilize debt for acquisitions or other permitted purposes in future periods, our interest expense may increase. Further, since the revolving loan and term loan borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates, our interest expense is sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest and, accordingly, our interest expense may vary from period to period. After taking into account interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations, at December 31, 2020, we had $825.8 million of\nindebtedness, or approximately 26 percent of our total outstanding indebtedness, which bore interest at floating rates. Over the course of the year, we also borrow revolving loans under our revolving loan facilities which bear interest at floating rates to fund our seasonal working capital needs. Accordingly, during 2020 our average outstanding variable rate debt, after taking into account the average outstanding notional amount of our interest rate swap agreements, was approximately 30 percent of our total outstanding indebtedness. You should also read Notes 10 and 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information regarding our interest rate swap agreements.\nIn light of our strategy to use leverage to support our growth and optimize shareholder returns, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant interest expense. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, our aggregate interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt as a percentage of our income before interest and income taxes was 20.3 percent, 29.4 percent and 28.2 percent, respectively.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain income statement data expressed as a percentage of net sales for each of the periods presented.

Consolidated net sales were $4.92 billion in 2020, representing an 9.6 percent increase as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes in each of the businesses including from acquisitions and a more favorable mix of products sold in the closures business, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs in each of the businesses, the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019 in the metal container business, a less favorable mix of products sold in the plastic container business and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Income before interest and income taxes for 2020 increased by $152.9 million, or 42.5 percent, as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of higher volumes and strong operating performance in each of the businesses, lower rationalization charges, higher pension income and a more favorable mix of products sold in the closures business, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of higher acquisition related costs, the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts in the metal container business, the negative impact from the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020 and the unfavorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of higher resin costs. Rationalization charges were $16.0 million and $56.3 million for the years ended 2020 and 2019, respectively. Results for 2020 and 2019 also included other pension and post retirement income of $38.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively, and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively. Net income in 2020 was $308.7 million as compared to $193.8 million in 2019.\nNet Sales. The $432.0 million increase in consolidated net sales in 2020 as compared to 2019 was due to higher net sales across all businesses.\nNet sales for the metal container business increased $84.8 million, or 3.4 percent, in 2020 as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily a result of higher unit volumes of approximately fourteen percent and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation of approximately $4.0 million, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs, a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the impact from the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019. Record unit volumes in 2020 resulted primarily from higher demand in at-home food consumption.\nNet sales for the closures business in 2020 increased $306.8 million, or 21.8 percent, as compared to 2019. This increase was primarily the result of higher unit volumes of approximately eight percent and a more favorable mix of products sold due primarily to strong unit volume growth in dispensing closures, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately\n$4 million. The increase in unit volumes was principally the result of the inclusion of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics which were acquired in 2020 and strength in volumes for consumer health, hygiene, personal care and food and beverage products. These volume gains were partially offset by weaker demand for certain beauty and fragrance products.\nNet sales for the plastic container business in 2020 increased $40.4 million, or 6.6 percent, as compared to 2019. This increase was principally due to higher volumes of approximately eleven percent, partially offset by the pass through of lower raw material costs, a less favorable mix of products sold and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $1.0 million. The increase in volumes was due primarily to higher demand for food and consumer health and hygiene products and continued new business awards.\nGross Profit. Gross profit margin increased 1.7 percentage points to 17.6 percent in 2020 as compared to 15.9 percent in 2019 for the reasons discussed below in \"Income before Interest and Income Taxes.\"\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated net sales increased 0.7 percentage points to 7.7 percent for 2020 as compared to 7.0 percent in 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $62.0 million in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million, the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses from the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and Cobra Plastics, one-time plant employee incentive payments and a charge of $3.2 million in the plastic container business for the resolution of a non-commercial legal dispute relating to prior periods.\nIncome before Interest and Income Taxes. Income before interest and income taxes for 2020 increased by $152.9 million as compared to 2019, and margin increased to 10.4 percent from 8.0 percent over the same periods. The increase in income before interest and income taxes was primarily the result of higher segment income in each of the businesses and lower rationalization charges, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses and the $3.5 million charge for the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020. Income before interest and income taxes included rationalization charges of $16.0 million and $56.3 million and costs attributed to announced acquisitions of $19.3 million and $1.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSegment income of the metal container business for 2020 increased $86.6 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 9.6 percent from 6.5 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to higher unit volumes, $39.5 million of lower rationalization charges, strong operating performance and higher pension income. These increases were partially offset by the impact from both a continued shift towards smaller metal packages sold and the renewal of certain significant customer contracts at the end of 2019. Rationalization charges were $9.9 million and $49.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Rationalization charges in 2019 were incurred primarily in connection with the shutdown of two manufacturing facilities and the resulting withdrawal from the Central States Pension Plan.\nSegment income of the closures business for 2020 increased $50.9 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 13.1 percent from 12.3 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily due to higher unit volumes including from acquisitions completed in 2020, a more favorable mix of products sold, strong operating performance and higher pension income, partially offset by the negative impact of a $3.5 million charge for the write-up of inventory for purchase accounting as a result of acquisitions completed in 2020.\nSegment income of the plastic container business for 2020 increased $38.9 million as compared to 2019, and segment income margin increased to 13.5 percent from 8.0 percent over the same periods. The increase in segment income and segment income margin was primarily attributable to higher volumes, strong operating performance and lower manufacturing costs and higher pension income, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a charge of $3.2 million for the resolution of a non-commercial legal dispute relating to prior periods and the unfavorable impact from the lagged pass through to customers of higher resin costs.\nInterest and Other Debt Expense. Interest and other debt expense before loss on early extinguishment of debt for 2020 was $103.8 million, a decrease of $1.9 million as compared to $105.7 million for 2019 due primarily to lower weighted average interest rates, partially offset by higher average outstanding borrowings principally related to the acquisition of the Alb\u00e9a Dispensing Business and additional revolving loan borrowings outstanding during the first half of 2020 primarily to hold cash and cash equivalents to ensure liquidity against potential credit market disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted average interest rates were lower during 2020 due to lower variable market rates and the redemption on August 1, 2019 of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes. Loss on early\nextinguishment of debt of $1.5 million in 2020 was a result of the prepayment of term loans under our Credit Agreement. Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.7 million in 2019 was a result of the redemption of all outstanding 5\u00bd% Notes in August 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rates for 2020 and 2019 were 24.2 percent and 23.1 percent. The effective tax rate in 2019 was favorably impacted by the resolution of a prior year tax audit and the timing of certain tax deductions.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018\nOverview. Consolidated net sales were $4.49 billion in 2019, representing an 0.9 percent increase as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the pass through of higher"}
