We qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2012 and our intention is to be organized and operate in a manner that allows us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nFrom July 2011 to September 2015, we raised approximately $1.7 billion through our Offerings. The net proceeds from our Offerings were contributed to CHP Partners, LP, our Operating Partnership, in exchange for partnership interests. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all operations are conducted, either directly or indirectly, through: (1) the Operating Partnership in which we are the sole limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, CHP GP, LLC, is the sole general partner; (2) a wholly owned TRS, CHP TRS Holding, Inc.; (3) property owner subsidiaries and lender subsidiaries, which are single purpose entities; and (4) investments in joint ventures.\nOn September 30, 2015, we completed our Offerings pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933 with the SEC. In October 2015, we deregistered the unsold shares of our common stock under our previous registration statement on Form S-11, except for 20 million shares that we concurrently registered on Form S-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 with the SEC for the sale of additional shares of common stock through our Reinvestment Plan.\nOur Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, recommending and executing acquisitions and dispositions on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement. Our Property Manager is responsible for managing and leasing our healthcare real estate investments. Our Advisor and Property Manager are each wholly owned by affiliates of our Sponsor, which is an affiliate of CNL, a private investment management firm providing global real estate and alternative investments. As a result, our Advisor and Property Manager each represent related parties and each have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing of our business.\nFor a description of the individual property holdings by asset class included in our healthcare real estate portfolio, including the location, date acquired, and purchase price, as of December 31, 2016, see Item 2. Properties.\u201d\nMarket Opportunities and Trends\nWe believe that medical care will continue to grow rapidly and steadily for two basic reasons-it is an essential human service for an aging demographic and it is heavily supported by the government. These factors may result in healthcare-related property investments potentially experiencing less economic volatility than other sectors.\nIn addition, there are indications that significant opportunities for consolidation exist in the seniors housing and healthcare facility sectors, which we believe will create value as our portfolio grows and achieves scale through asset aggregation. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research Report entitled Healthcare REITs: a defensive play on aging demographics\u201d dated September 24, 2013 ( BofA Report\u201d) estimates that the total value of healthcare-related real estate ranges from $700 billion to over $1 trillion, with REIT ownership accounting for only about 14% of the total. This continued ownership fragmentation of the healthcare property industry provides adequate opportunity for growth through consolidation opportunities.\nThe specific trends and characteristics unique to the healthcare sector and the asset classes on which we focus are described in greater detail below.\nDemand Drivers for Healthcare Property\nThe primary drivers behind demand for seniors housing, medical office, acute care and post-acute care properties are the aging of the U.S. population and growth in national healthcare expenditures.\nExpanded Healthcare Insurance Coverage. As the U.S. population over the age of 65 increases, more Americans become entitled to Medicare to cover their increasing healthcare needs and related costs. In addition, under The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Affordable Care Act\u201d) and other legislation, healthcare insurance coverage has expanded in recent years to cover more of the non-elderly, lower income populations. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, less than 9 percent of the population did not have health insurance coverage at the beginning of 2016, down from 16 percent at the time the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. The resulting expansion of U.S. healthcare insurance coverage has created an increase in demand for healthcare services and healthcare facilities of all types. There is a risk however that the Affordable Care Act could be repealed in the future and may be replaced with new legislation, the effects of which are unknown at this time. The impact of repealing existing legislation, or introducing new legislation, could materially increase the uninsured population in the U.S. who are not able to obtain or afford health insurance coverage. We believe efforts to preserve and increase access to care will remain a primary focus of the new administration.\nThe Aging of America. According to a December 2014 report of the U.S. Census Bureau, 12,000 people in the United States will turn 65 every day until 2060. Most recent US Census Bureau projections (as of December 2014) estimate that by 2060, 98 million Americans , or 23.6% of the U.S. population, will be 65 years or older, compared to 14.9% of the population in 2015, an anticipated increase of 105% in the senior population between 2015 and 2060. The graph below depicts the projected increase in the size of the senior population in the United States over time based upon national population projections by the U.S. Census Bureau:\nSource: US Census Bureau, December 2014\nDisability is defined under the ADA as a substantial limitation in a major life activity. Research indicates that age is positively correlated with the presence of a physical disability, and the oldest people have the highest levels of both physical and cognitive disabilities. With the increasing age of the U.S. population, the healthcare system faces an increase in the population with age-related physical and cognitive disabilities, which require increased supportive health care services as well as housing options for older adults. Additionally, we expect an increased demand for healthcare facilities providing physician and ancillary care services for such disabilities.\nRising Healthcare Expenditures. The rise in the aging population, the expansion of U.S. healthcare insurance coverage through Medicare or other means, and medical technology innovations contribute to increasing healthcare expenditures. National healthcare spending is projected to increase from approximately 16 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 to approximately 25 percent by 2040 according to The 2015 Long-Term Budget Outlook\u201d, produced by the Congressional Budget Office in June 2015.\nThe following graph depicts the projected rise in the national healthcare expenditures in the U.S. between 2000 and 2025:\nSource: 1- National Health Expenditure Projections 2015-2025,\u201d The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary, National Health Statistics Group. 2-GDP Projections from An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016-2026\u201d, Congressional Budget Office, August 2016.\nAs Americans age, they spend more on healthcare. The following graph depicts the increase in average annual per capita spending by Americans on healthcare as they age.\nSource: Health Expenditures by Age and Gender,\u201d The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2012.\nSeniors Housing and Post-Acute Care Supply and Demand\nDemographics and Existing Units. According to a National Center for Health Statistics report entitled Health: United States, 2015\u201d dated May 2016, individuals who are 65 years old in 2014 can expect to live, on average, an additional 19.3 years, up from an average of 13.9 additional years for those aged 65 in 1950 - a net gain of 5.4 years. Americans 65 years and older have longer life expectancies than the elderly did in the past and will therefore need additional housing options to accommodate their special needs as they age. Demand for seniors housing options is currently outpacing the existing supply of seniors housing units. According to the ASHA Special Issue Brief: A Projection of Demand for Market Rate U.S. Seniors Housing 2015-2040, American Seniors Housing Association, Winter 2016, the projected annual demand growth for seniors housing will increase as baby boomers\u201d pass the over-75 age-threshold after 2020, increasing from the level of 25,000 units per year from 2015 to 2020 to a demand of 92,000 units per year from 2025 to 2030. The ASHA Special Issue Brief projects that approximately 1.8 million senior living units need to be constructed by 2040 to accommodate aging Americans at the same market penetration rate encountered today.\nSource: A Projection of Demand for Market Rate U.S. Seniors Housing 2015-2040, American Seniors Housing Association, Winter 2016.\nThe supply growth of certain seniors housing asset classes over the last decade declined following a boom in seniors housing development in the 1990's. Since 2008, there has been modest growth in the total national inventory of seniors housing units according to National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care ( NIC\u201d) data, with a compound annual growth rate of 2.0% for seniors housing facilities as of the end of 2016. However, the number of new seniors housing units under construction is increasing. Muted supply growth has helped rental levels recover and occupancy improve despite a modest economic recovery. The following graph depicts seniors housing supply-demand trends for independent living and assisted living combined:\nSource: National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, NIC MAP Property Trend, Q4-2016\nAccording to data from the NIC for the fourth quarter of 2016, overall seniors housing occupancy in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas ( MSAs\u201d) was 89.4%. As of the fourth quarter of 2016, occupancy was 3.1 percentage points above its cyclical low of 87.1% during the first quarter of 2010. In 2016, inventory of seniors housing units grew by 27,076 units. This growth in inventory has contributed to a decline in overall occupancy by 0.6 percentage points from year end 2015. We believe seniors housing development will remain at an acceptable level given the growth in aging demographics, and that sufficient demand exists to absorb the new development units over time.\nRise in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. According to a study funded by the Alzheimer's Association and NIH/National Institute on Aging, the number of people in the U.S. with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple by 2050, straining our healthcare system and taxing the resources of caregivers. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or slow the disease, approximately 13.8 million people age 65 and older are projected to have Alzheimer's disease by 2050. The following graph depicts the projected rise in the number of senior population with Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. broken down by three age groups.\nSource: Hebert LE, Weuve J, Scherr PA, Evans DA. Alzheimer disease in the United States (2010-2050) estimated using the 2010 Census. .\nAccording to a National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief dated November 2013, in 2010, approximately 42% of individuals living in residential care communities had Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. We believe that the projected rise in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease creates a need for seniors housing options that address the specialized needs of Alzheimer's and other dementia patients and their families, which often cannot be addressed in a traditional home setting.\nStronger U.S. Housing Market. As the broader economy recovers and the U.S. residential real estate market strengthens, it is widely believed that the demand for seniors housing will continue to grow as the baby boomer\u201d generation reaches retirement and transitions to active adult communities and other seniors housing facilities. Seniors often sell their homes and use the proceeds to pay rent in private-pay retirement communities creating a strong correlation between seniors housing demand and home prices. According to data from a December 2016 report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University ( Joint Center Report\u201d), the number of households headed by seniors will increase more than 60% over the next two decades. As the senior population ages into their late 70s and this segment of the population grows, they tend to seek more accessible and convenient living options. The Joint Center Report states the sheer growth in the older population will mean the number of renter households will expand from 6 to more than 11 million households over the next two decades. Overall, the share of renters will increase slightly, from 21 percent of older households in 2015 to 23 percent in 2035.\nSeniors Housing and Post-Acute Care Asset Classes\nBased on the above fundamentals and perceived trends, we may invest in or develop the following classes of seniors housing and post-acute care properties:\nSeniors Housing Communities\nActive Adult Communities. Active adult communities offer social and recreational-centered living in a setting that may include town homes, condominiums, cluster homes, manufactured housing, single family homes and multi-family housing. These communities are generally classified as either: (a) age-restricted communities that require at least one household member to be over the age of 55 in at least 80% of the occupied units; or (b) age-targeted communities that target adults age 55 or older with no explicit age restrictions. Residents typically lead independent, active lifestyles in a country club setting where they can take advantage of amenities such as a clubhouse, gathering center or recreational center that is the focal point of activities, and may include a golf course, walking trails, hobby centers or other recreational spaces. These communities are generally not equipped to provide increased care or health-related services.\nIndependent Living Facilities. Independent living facilities are age-restricted, multi-family rental or ownership (condominium) housing with central dining facilities that provide residents, as part of a monthly fee, meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation, social and recreational activities.\nAssisted Living Facilities. Assisted living facilities are usually state-regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but also provide, in a majority of the units, supportive care from trained employees to residents who are unable to live independently and require assistance with activities of daily living. The additional services may include assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, and administering medications.\nContinuing Care Retirement Communities. Continuing care retirement communities offer age-restricted seniors housing facilities with a combination of independent living lifestyle options for individuals who do not need constant physician or nursing supervision and assisted living or skilled nursing facilities available to residents on the same or adjacent property of the complex. This type of community generally offers a longer term contract for seniors that provides for housing, services and nursing care with varying payment plans that may include entrance fees and condominium or cooperative rental programs. In general, these properties provide residential living in an apartment-style building with services and dining usually on the main level. In addition, those in a campus-like setting of several acres may offer other individual multi-family homes and offer amenities that may be similar to those found in an active adult community.\nMemory Care/Alzheimer's Facilities. Those suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of memory loss need specialized care. Memory care/Alzheimer's centers provide the specialized care for this population including residential housing and assistance with the activities of daily living.\nPost-Acute Care Properties\nSkilled Nursing Facilities. A skilled nursing facility generally provides the highest level of care for older adults outside of a hospital and also provides custodial care and assistance with the activities of daily living. Skilled nursing facilities differ from other seniors housing facilities in that they also provide a high level of medical care. A licensed physician supervises each patient's care and a nurse or other medical professional is almost always on the premises. Skilled nursing care is available on site, usually 24 hours a day. Other medical professionals, such as occupational or physical therapists, are also available. This allows the delivery of medical procedures and therapies on site that would not be possible in other housing options.\nLong-Term Acute Care Hospitals. Long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACHs, are certified as acute care hospitals, but focus on patients who, on average, stay more than 25 days. Many of the patients in LTACHs are transferred from a hospital-based intensive or critical care unit. LTACHs specialize in treating patients who may have more than one serious condition, but who may improve with time and care and eventually return home. Services provided in LTACHs typically include comprehensive rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment and pain management.\nInpatient Rehabilitative Facilities. Inpatient rehabilitative facilities are licensed facilities that provide intensive rehabilitation programs to patients who typically have complex medical issues resulting from incidents of trauma or strokes. They focus on providing high levels of physical, occupational and speech therapy under the supervision of highly trained medical doctors, staff and therapists.\nMedical Office Building and Acute Care Property Supply and Demand\nDemographics and Existing Space. The increased demand for medical office buildings, acute care and post-acute care properties is also supported by an aging population and increased health insurance coverage. As Americans 65 years and older have longer life expectancies than in the past, their need for health related services is projected to increase the need for additional healthcare properties. In 2012, persons over age 65 were 14 percent of the U.S. population but accounted for 27 percent of physician visits in the U.S. According to the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, individuals over age 65 made an average of 5.9 visits to physicians' offices in 2012, or 2.7 times the number of visits made by individuals under 45 years of age. The graph below depicts the average number of physicians' visits in the U.S. by age group in 2012.\nSource: CDC/NCHS, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2012\nEvolution of the U.S. Healthcare Model. Rising healthcare costs create pressure within the healthcare industry to move from an inpatient to an outpatient delivery setting in order to provide service more efficiently and contain costs. The outpatient model of healthcare services results in declining hospital admissions and overnight stays with a focus toward performing certain procedures and diagnostic services in a more consumer-centric, cost-effective setting. According to the Urban Land Institute Report, almost 65% of all surgeries today do not require an overnight hospital stay, compared with only 16% of all surgeries in 1980. Technology advances are also driving patient demand for more medical services and the space in which to deliver them. The shift to outpatient surgeries also continues to be encouraged by technological advances that involve smaller incisions, improved anesthetics, less risk of infection and faster recoveries. The increase in outpatient procedures drives greater demand for medical office buildings and other healthcare properties in which such procedures can be performed.\nThe following graph depicts the increase in outpatient surgeries vs. inpatient surgeries in the United States under the new, evolving U.S. healthcare model:\nSource: Trendwatch Chartbook 2016: American Hospital Association\nConsumer-Driven Healthcare Model. Today's patients often select their doctors based not only on the quality of care offered but also on the ease of access to such doctors. Hospitals are therefore expanding into community-based settings and encouraging large practices to open satellite offices. According to the Medical Office Research Report\u201d published by Marcus & Millichap in 2013, this bodes well for medical office building owners, as many providers, including physician practices affiliated with or owned by major health systems, will favor well-located, multi-tenant medical office buildings, particularly those with tenant rosters that promote cross-referrals. At the same time, however, some share of tenant demand will be diverted to storefront clinics and large ambulatory care centers.\nMedical Office Buildings and Acute Care Property Asset Classes\nBased on the increased numbers of insured Americans, increased healthcare visits by a growing, aging U.S. population and an evolving U.S. healthcare model driving a need for additional healthcare properties, we may invest in or develop the following classes of medical office buildings, acute care properties and other healthcare-related properties:\nMedical Office Buildings. These properties include traditional medical office buildings, specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities, surgery centers, outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other facilities designated for clinical services. The buildings may be located on the campus of a hospital, adjacent to campus, or as a hub and spoke\u201d location whereby the hospital desires to establish a presence in a particular market. Medical office buildings may also be unaffiliated with a health system and could be multi-tenant or single-tenant in nature.\nAcute Care Properties. These properties include specialty hospitals which are primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of patients having a cardiac or orthopedic condition or patients undergoing a surgical procedure. General acute care hospitals also fall within the category of acute care properties and offer a variety of services including operating and recovery rooms, imaging and diagnostic services, delivery and neonatal care, oncology services, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy and other outpatient services.\nOther Healthcare-Related Properties\nOther healthcare-related properties in which we believe there are opportunities based on current supply and demand factors are pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturing facilities, laboratories, life-science and research facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary source of capital for items other than acquisitions of real estate, through the close of our Offerings on September 30, 2015, was proceeds we received from our Offerings. While our Offerings closed on September 30, 2015, we continue to provide existing stockholders the opportunity to designate their cash distributions for reinvestment through our Reinvestment Plan. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from collateralized or uncollateralized financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties, other assets and undistributed operating cash flows. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately $11.1 million of available proceeds remaining under our senior unsecured revolving line of credit ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nWe substantially completed our acquisition phase in 2016 and expect future acquisition activity to be limited. Prior to completion of our acquisition phase, our principal demand for funds has been for acquisitions, the payment of debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions. Generally, we expect to meet short-term working capital needs from our cash flows from operations and proceeds from our Reinvestment Plan.\nWe may also be negatively impacted by rising interest rates on any unhedged variable rate debt or the timing of when we seek to refinance existing debt. In addition, we will continue to evaluate the need for additional interest rate protection in the form of interest rate swaps or caps on unhedged variable rate debt.\nSources of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCommon Stock Offerings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from our Offerings of approximately $551.9 million and $554.6 million respectively.\nReinvestment Plan\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from our Reinvestment Plan of approximately $42.6 million, $36.8 million and $17.7 million respectively.\nBorrowings\nWe have borrowed and intend to continue borrowing money to fund ongoing real estate development and other enhancements to our portfolio, as well as to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we borrowed proceeds of approximately $142.5 million, $549.2 million and $510.3 million, respectively, net of repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility of $120.3 million, $321.4 million and $259.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts were primarily used to fund real estate under development and acquire additional properties. While we have substantially completed our acquisition phase, we may evaluate additional acquisition opportunities and borrow additional money to fund such acquisitions.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a $230 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $175 million senior unsecured term loan facility ( Term Loan Facility\u201d and, collectively, Credit Facilities\u201d). Pursuant to the associated credit agreement, we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity to $700 million under the accordion feature of the Credit Facilities. To date, we have exercised this accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity to $445 million. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility has an initial term through December 2017 plus two 12-month extension options through which we can extend the term through December 2019; whereas the Term Loan Facility has an initial term through February 2019 plus one 12-month extension option through which we can extend the term through February 2020. We expect to exercise one of our two 12-month extension options on the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the term through December 2018.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a $250 million senior unsecured term loan facility ( Second Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Second Term Loan Facility has an initial term through November 2020 and we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity to $350M under its accordion feature. To date, we have exercised this accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity to $275 million.\nIn March 2017, we obtained approximately $28 million of additional borrowings related to Wellmore of Tega Cay, which was an unencumbered asset as of December 31, 2016. The loan has an initial term of 36 months plus one 12-month extension option, an interest rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 2.65% per annum and a 12-month interest only period followed by a 30-year amortization for the remaining term of the loan.\nWe may borrow money to pay distributions to stockholders, for working capital and for other corporate purposes. See Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources - Distributions\u201d below for additional information related to the payment of distributions with Other Sources for GAAP purposes. In many cases, we have pledged our assets in connection with our borrowings and intend to encumber assets in connection with additional borrowings. The aggregate amount of long-term financing is not expected to exceed 60% of our total assets on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an aggregate debt leverage ratio of approximately 55.8% and 52.6%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of our assets.\nThe following table provides details of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages payable and other notes payable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fixed rate debt\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 382,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 391,639\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Variable rate debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 561,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgages and other notes payable (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 944,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 840,656\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Premium (discount), net (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (221)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loan costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,213)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,610)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total mortgages and other notes payable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 936,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 831,825\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Revolving Credit Facility (4) (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> First Term Loan Facility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Second Term Loan Facility (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 260,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Loan costs, net related to Term Loan Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,874)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,716)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total credit facilities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 641,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 656,284\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,578,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,488,109\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\nFOOTNOTES:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts of approximately $521.5 million and $480.7 million, respectively, which were settling on a monthly basis.

The loan agreements also contain customary events of default and remedies for the lenders. The borrowers are normally direct or indirect subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership.\nThe Credit Facilities contain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants which are customary for loans of this type, including (but not limited to): (i) maximum leverage, (ii) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, (iii) minimum consolidated net worth, (iv) restrictions on payments of cash distributions except if required by REIT requirements, (v) maximum secured indebtedness, (vi) maximum secured recourse debt, (vii) minimum unsecured interest coverage and (viii) limitations on certain types of investments and with respect to the pool of properties supporting borrowings under the Credit Facilities, minimum debt service coverage ratio, minimum weighted average occupancy, and remaining lease terms, as well as property type, MSA, operator, and asset value concentration limits. The limitations on distributions include a limitation on the extent of allowable distributions, which are not to exceed the greater of 95% of adjusted FFO (as defined per the Credit Facilities) and the minimum amount of distributions required to maintain our REIT status. We do not expect this limitation to be a limiting factor for our board of directors when determining distribution levels now or in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and ratios.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 10. Indebtedness\u201d for additional information on our borrowings, including a schedule of future principal payments and maturity dates. In addition, see Off-Balance Sheet and Other Arrangements\u201d below for a description of the borrowings of our unconsolidated entities.\nTenant Workouts\nIn July 2015, an anchor tenant at two of our medical office buildings filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. In May 2016, we signed new lease agreements for a majority of the original leased spaces with the health system that purchased substantially all of the anchor tenant's operations. In addition, the anchor tenant rejected two of the previous space leases as part of its bankruptcy reorganization, which resulted in us assuming a sublease under the original lease structure with the anchor tenant and recording a loss on lease terminations of approximately $0.8 million related to the vacated space leases. The impact of this workout did not have a material impact on our operating cash flows given that revenues attributable to the anchor tenant represented less than 1.0% of our total revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDuring 2015, the tenant at two of our specialty hospitals experienced financial difficulty and defaulted on its lease agreements at both properties. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment provision of approximately $4.7 million related to the lease intangibles and a loss on lease termination of approximately $0.9 million related to deferred rent and other lease related assets. In September 2015, in connection with consenting to the sale of the operations by our previous tenant to a third-party buyer at our specialty hospital in Beaumont, TX, we signed an amended and restated lease agreement with the buyer that included similar economic terms as the previous lease. In January 2016, we executed a lease with a new tenant at our specialty hospital in Hurst, TX that included similar economic terms as the previous lease. As incentive for entering into a long-term lease, the tenant was granted six months of free rent\u201d in 2016. This new lease increased our operating cash flows in 2016 given the loss of revenues generated by the default on the previous lease during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProceeds from Sale of Real Estate\nIn November 2016, we completed the sale of Dogwood Forest of Acworth and received sales proceeds of approximately $33.6 million, which were used to pay down the Revolving Credit Facility, as this property was included in the unencumbered pool of assets supporting our availability thereunder, and to fund cash distributions for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nDistributions from Unconsolidated Entities\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an investment in five unconsolidated properties through an unconsolidated joint venture. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, we are entitled to receive quarterly preferred cash distributions to the extent there is cash available to distribute. These distributions are generally received within 45 days after each quarter end. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we received approximately $0.7 million and $0.9 million of operating distributions from our investment in these unconsolidated entities, respectively. In addition, we received capital distributions from the Windsor Manor joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $2.2 million, which resulted from excess proceeds on refinancing the joint venture's debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we received approximately $1.9 million of operating distributions from our two investments in unconsolidated entities held during the period. In August 2014, we acquired our co-venture partner's 10% interest in the Montecito joint venture for approximately $1.6 million. As a result of this transaction, we own 100% of the Montecito joint venture and began consolidating all of the assets, liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements upon acquisition. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 3. Acquisitions - Purchase of Controlling Interest in Montecito Joint Venture\u201d for additional information.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nWe experienced positive cash flow from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 of approximately $73.4 million, $43.5 million and $19.3 million, respectively. The change in cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of the following:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase in total revenues and net operating income ( NOI\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as the result of having 134 consolidated operating properties in 2016 as compared to 132 consolidated operating properties in 2015, some of which were not owned for the entire period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a decrease in lease incentives paid in connection with the build-out of space for certain tenants entering into new leases or extending existing leases at our MOBs in which we paid $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $13.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a decrease in acquisition fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, as we acquired one operating property for approximately $28.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, in which we acquired 39 operating properties totaling $880.9 million. We consider acquisition fees and expenses to be funded from Other Sources, but such amounts are treated as an operating activity in accordance with GAAP;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> offset by an increase in interest expense paid resulting from additional borrowings obtained during 2016 and borrowings obtained during 2015 being outstanding for the entire period;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a net increase in asset management fees resulting from higher average assets under management across periods; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an increase in general and administrative expenses paid resulting from higher average assets under management across periods.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpense Support Agreements\nPursuant to the expense support agreements, our Advisor and Property Manager agreed to forgo the payment of fees in cash and accept forfeitable restricted common stock ( Restricted Stock\u201d) for services in an amount equal to the positive excess, if any, of (a) aggregate stockholder cash distributions declared for the applicable quarter, over (b) our aggregate modified funds from operations, as defined ( Original Expense Support Agreements\u201d). The Advisor expense support amount was determined for each calendar quarter, on a non-cumulative basis, on each quarter-end date (\"Original Determination Date\u201d). The Property Manager expense support amount was determined for each calendar quarter, on a non-cumulative basis, after the calculation of the Advisor expense support amount pursuant to the Property Manager Expense Support Agreement on each quarter-end date. The Restricted Stock is subordinated and forfeited to the extent that shareholders do not receive their invested capital plus a 6% cumulative noncompounded annual return upon ultimate liquidity of the Company. Any amounts settled, and for which restricted stock shares were issued, pursuant to the Original Expense Support Agreements have been permanently settled and we have no further obligation to pay such amounts to the Advisor or the Property Manager.\nIn March 2016, our board of directors approved the third amended and restated expense support agreements with both the Advisor and Property Manager that were effective January 1, 2016 (\"Amended Expense Support Agreements\u201d) and changed the calculation and determination date of the respective affiliate's expense support amounts from each calendar quarter on a non-cumulative basis, to each calendar year on a cumulative year-to-date basis (\"Amended Determination Date\u201d). Under the terms of the Amended Expense Support Agreements, for each quarter within a calendar expense support year, we record a proportional estimate of the cumulative year-to-date period based on an estimate of expense support amounts for the calendar expense support year. Moreover, in exchange for services rendered and in consideration of the expense support provided, under the Amended Expense Support Agreements, we shall issue, within 90 days following each Amended Determination Date, a number of shares of Restricted Stock equal to the quotient of the expense support amounts provided by the Advisor and Property Manager for the preceding calendar year divided by the then-current estimated NAV per share of common stock. The terms of the Amended Expense Support Agreements automatically renew for consecutive one year periods, subject to the right of the Advisor or Property Manager to terminate their respective agreements upon 30 days' written notice.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our cash from operating activities was positively impacted by approximately $2.9 million of a reduction in asset management fees resulting from the annual expense support amount expected to be settled in accordance with the terms of the Amended Expense Support Agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our cash from operating activities were positively impacted by approximately $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of reductions in asset management fees resulting from the annual expense support amount settled in accordance with the terms of the Original Expense Support Agreements. The decrease in asset management fees settled in accordance with the applicable expense support agreements is generally reflective of our growth in NOI outpacing the growth in our distributions, interest expense and other expense items. There have not been any amounts settled under the Property Manager Expense Support Agreement since its inception. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 11. Related Party Arrangements\u201d for additional information.\nIn February 2017, our board of directors approved the fourth amended and restated expense support agreements with both the Advisor and Property Manager that are effective January 1, 2017. These amendments limit the annual expense support amount to four percent of the then-current estimated NAV per share and change the calculation to exclude the impact of completed development properties for a specified period of time after the property is placed into service (as defined in the agreement).\nUses of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAcquisitions\nWe substantially completed our acquisition phase during 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we acquired one, 39, and 35 consolidated operating properties, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price paid of approximately $28.1 million, $866.3 million, and $869.5 million, respectively, net of liabilities assumed. The acquired operating properties were spread across our targeted asset classes and located in one, 20, and 14 different states, respectively, which allowed us to expand both the variety of our asset classes and the geographical diversification of our healthcare investment portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our total leasable square footage increased by approximately 0.1 million, 2.0 million, and 1.6 million, respectively, related to acquisitions. There was no increase in total units in the current year as a result of acquisitions. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our total units increased by approximately 1,786, and 1,509, respectively, related to acquisitions.\nDevelopment Properties\nIn connection with our seniors housing and post-acute care developments, we funded approximately $95.1 million, $73.6 million and $47.2 million in development costs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Pursuant to the development agreements for the active properties under development as of December 31, 2016, we expect to fund approximately $47.0 million of additional development and other costs. We expect to fund the remaining development and other costs primarily from construction loans on each development or other cash flows from financing activities.\nIn February 2017, we received certificates of occupancy at the Welbrook Senior Living Grand Junction and Waterstone on Augusta development properties and are in the process of obtaining licensure at both properties in order to open to residents, which is expected to occur by April 2017. We expect to incur additional pre-leasing and marketing activities as these properties continue through the lease-up phase in 2017 and 2018.\nAs a result of our completed seniors housing developments continuing to move towards or achieving stabilization, we expect to pay additional amounts in future periods to the respective third-party developers as holders of a promoted interest in these properties. We continue to monitor the lease-up of these properties to determine whether the established performance metrics have been met. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid distributions to the holders of promoted interest of the Dogwood Forest of Acworth and Wellmore of Tega Cay developments of approximately $1.9 million and $2.8 million, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2016, we have accrued approximately $2.0 million related to Dogwood Forest of Acworth that will be retained until the completion of the Dogwood Forest of Grayson development, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017. Our obligation to pay the promoted interest on the Dogwood Forest of Acworth property is not impacted by the sale of the property in November 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we made distributions of approximately $2.0 million to a third-party developer, who is a holder of promoted interest related to our HarborChase of Villages Crossing.\nDebt Repayments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid approximately $174.5 million of total repayments which was comprised of $120.3 million in repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility, $34.4 million in repayments on our mortgage loans for the Wellmore of Tega Cay Property and Raider Ranch Community, prior to the scheduled maturities, and $19.8 million of scheduled repayments. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid approximately $437.2 million of total repayments which was comprised of $321.4 million in debt repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility, $93.5 million in repayments on our mortgage loans for the Perennial Communities, Medical Portfolio I Properties, Dogwood Forest of Acworth and HarborChase of Villages Crossing prior to their scheduled maturities, $4.4 million of prepayments on our mortgage loan for the Capital Health Communities related to monies received under a yield guaranty agreement and $17.9 million of scheduled repayments. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid approximately $286.3 million of total repayments which was comprised of $259.3 million in repayments on our Revolving Credit Facility, $15.0 million in repayments on our unsecured bridge loan financing, $9.4 million of scheduled repayments and $2.6 million of prepayments on our Capital Health mortgage loan related to monies received under a yield guaranty agreement. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 9. Contingent Purchase Price Consideration\u201d for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have approximately $263.8 million of debt obligations coming due in the latter part of 2017; of which approximately $194.9 million relates to the Revolving Credit Facility pursuant to which we hold two 12-month extension options and we currently anticipate exercising one of our options. The remaining $68.9 million is comprised of the following: (1) approximately $19.9 million of scheduled repayments on various properties; (2) an approximate $18.1 million debt maturity in September 2017 related to Lee Hughes Medical Building for which we hold a 12-month extension option that we currently anticipate exercising; (3) an approximate $6.9 million debt maturity in October 2017 related to Northwest Medical Park for which we hold a 12-month extension option that we currently anticipate exercising; and (4) an approximate $24.0 million debt maturity in December 2017 related to the development of our Watercrest at Katy community. On an ongoing basis, we monitor our debt maturities, engage in dialogues with third-party lenders about various financing scenarios and are currently working and analyzing our overall portfolio borrowings in advance of the maturity dates of the aforementioned debt obligations to determine the optimal borrowing strategy.\nStock Issuance and Offering Costs\nUnder the terms of the Offerings, certain affiliates and third-party broker dealers were entitled to receive selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds on all shares sold, a marketing support fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds, and reimbursement of actual expenses incurred in connection with the Offerings. In accordance with our articles of incorporation and the advisory agreement, the total amount of selling commissions, marketing support fees, due diligence expense reimbursements, and organizational and other offering costs to be paid by us may not exceed 15% of the gross aggregate proceeds of our Offerings.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid approximately $0.03 million, $59.0 million, and $58.9 million, respectively, of stock issuance and offering costs.\nLease Incentives\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we paid approximately $5.4 million, $13.2 million, and $1.0 million, respectively, of costs on behalf of our tenants as lease incentives in connection with the build-out of space for certain tenants entering into new leases or extending existing leases at our MOBs. While we expect the impact of these lease incentives to adversely impact our cash flows from operations in the near term, we anticipate that the new leasing activity will contribute to same-store NOI growth in future periods and that the extension of existing lease terms could increase the value of our properties.\nCommon Stock Redemptions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we received redemption requests for 3.7 million shares at an average redemption price of $9.73 per share of which approximately $28.6 million was paid and approximately $10.4 million was payable as of December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we received redemption requests for 1.0 million shares at an average redemption price of $9.51 per share of which approximately $7.4 million was paid and approximately $2.7 million was payable as of December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received redemption requests for 0.3 million shares at an average redemption price of $9.24 per share of which approximately $2.2 million was paid and approximately $0.9 million was payable as of December 31, 2014.\nSee Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Redemption Plan\u201d for additional information related to the redemption of common stock.\nDistributions\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to make distributions, other than capital gain distributions, to our stockholders each year in the amount of at least 90% of our taxable income. We may make distributions in the form of cash or other property, including distributions of our own securities. While we generally expect to pay distributions from cash flows provided by operating activities, we have and may continue to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities with proceeds from Other Sources.\nThe following table represents total cash distributions declared, distributions reinvested and cash distributions per share for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Distributions Paid (1)\n</td>

However, we consider acquisition fees and costs to be paid for with proceeds from our Offerings as opposed to operating cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we expensed approximately $1.0 million, $21.5 million and $23.9 million, respectively, in acquisition fees and expenses, which were paid from the proceeds of our Offerings.

Risk Factors\u201d.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\nFiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned 134 consolidated real estate investment properties and our portfolio consisted of 5,432 units operated under management agreements with third-party operators and approximately 5.8 million leasable square feet that was 95.3% leased to third-party tenants.\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investment count as of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating investment types:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seniors housing leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seniors housing managed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical office leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Post-acute care leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acute care leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental Income from Operating Leases. Rental income from operating leases was approximately $124.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in rental income from operating leases resulted from the leased properties acquired during 2015 being held for the entire year as well as the increased rental income resulting from the tenant workouts described above in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Tenant Workouts.\u201d\nResident Fees and Services. Resident fees and services income was approximately $232.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in resident fees and services is a result of the managed properties acquired during 2015 held for entire year as well as the continued lease-up of completed developments and value-add properties across periods. The increase in revenue for the year was partially offset by our decision to convert certain skilled nursing units to assisted living units at our Isle at Cedar Ridge and Isle at Watercrest - Bryan communities.\nTenant Reimbursement Income. Tenant reimbursement income was approximately $19.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This amount is comprised of common area maintenance ( CAM\u201d) revenue which increased as a result of the medical office leased properties acquired during 2015 being held for the entire year.\nProperty Operating Expenses. Property operating expenses were approximately $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $149.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase is a result of the properties acquired during 2015 being held for the entire year.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $12.8 million as compared to approximately $10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. General and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of personnel expenses of affiliates of our Advisor, directors' and officers' insurance, franchise taxes, accounting and legal fees, and board of director fees. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributed to increased costs as a result of the growth of our portfolio from the prior comparable periods. Specifically, we incurred increased personnel expenses reimbursable to the Advisor due to increased accounting, legal and administrative activity as a result of the growth of the portfolio and related reporting.\nAcquisition Fees and Expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $1.2 million of which approximately $0.2 million was capitalized as real estate under development. We incurred approximately $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 of which approximately $4.2 million was capitalized as real estate under development. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the Cobalt Rehabilitation Hospital of New Orleans. Acquisition fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to the acquisition of 39 operating properties totaling approximately $880.9 million. We expect acquisition fees and expenses to remain at low levels in future periods as we anticipate additional purchases of real estate will be limited.\nAsset Management Fees. We incurred approximately $29.1 million in asset management fees payable to our Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to approximately $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, in asset management fees were settled in\naccordance with the terms of the Amended Expense Support Agreements and the Original Expense Support Agreements, respectively, and approximately $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, were capitalized as real estate under development. As described in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 11. Related Party Arrangements,\u201d asset management fees were reduced because the shares of Restricted Stock, which will be accepted by the Advisor as payment for asset management services rendered, were valued at zero- the lowest possible value estimated at vesting. Monthly asset management fees equal to 0.08334% of invested assets are paid to the Advisor for management of our real estate assets, including our pro rata share of our investments in unconsolidated entities, loans and other permitted investments.\nProperty Management Fees. We incurred approximately $21.2 million in property management fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately $2.7 million and $3.6 million, respectively, were capitalized as real estate under development. Property management fees generally range from 2% to 5% of property revenues for leased properties, depending on the type of property, and are paid to third-party managers. However, an oversight fee equal to 1% of property revenues is paid to the Property Manager for those properties managed by a third-party. Overall property management fees primarily increased as a result of the increases in rental income from operating leases and resident fees and services properties acquired during 2015 being operational for a full period.\nContingent purchase price consideration adjustment. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, adjustments for contingent purchase price consideration were approximately $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The adjustments in 2016 were related to Shores of Lake Phalen, Siena Pavilion VI and Superior Residences of Panama City. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 9. Contingent Purchase Price Consideration\u201d for additional information. The adjustments in 2015 were related to the expiration of the Chestnut Commons Earn-out agreement and our Capital Health Yield Guaranty.\nImpairment Provision. As described in Liquidity and Capital Resources - Tenant Workouts,\u201d during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment provision of $4.7 million to write-off the lease intangibles related to two of our specialty hospitals, as it was determined that the carrying value of these assets would not be recoverable. There were no impairments during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nLoss on Lease Termination. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a loss on lease termination of approximately $0.8 million related to the bankruptcy reorganization of an anchor tenant at two of our medical office buildings as it was determined that certain deferred rents and other lease related assets would not be recoverable; refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Tenant Workouts\u201d for additional information. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a loss on lease termination of $0.9 million related to two of our specialty hospitals, as it was determined that the carrying value of certain deferred rent and lease incentives would not be recoverable.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $123.0 million and approximately $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Depreciation and amortization expenses are comprised of depreciation and amortization of the buildings, equipment, land improvements and in-place leases related to our real estate portfolio. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense across periods resulted from the acquisition of properties during 2015 that were owned for the entire period and the result of development properties that became operational in 2016.\nInterest Expense and Loan Cost Amortization. Interest expense and loan cost amortization for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $61.1 million of which $2.8 million was capitalized as development costs relating to our real estate under development. Interest expense and loan cost amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $45.3 million of which approximately $2.3 million was capitalized as development costs relating to our real estate under development. Approximately $14.6 million of the increase for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding to approximately $1.5 billion as compared to approximately $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred approximately $0.2 million in additional loan costs amortization related to debt obtained during the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a write-off of approximately $0.4 million in loan costs and paid an exit fee of approximately $1.1 million in connection with an early extinguishment of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a write-off of approximately $0.7 million in loan costs and paid approximately $0.3 million on the derecognition of cash flow hedges in connection with the early extinguishment of debt.\nEquity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Entities. Our unconsolidated entities generated earnings of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to losses of approximately ($0.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to our investment in the Windsor Manor joint venture. Equity in earnings (loss) of unconsolidated entities is determined using the hypothetical liquidation method book value ( HLBV\u201d) method of accounting, which can create significant variability in earnings or loss from the joint venture while the preferred cash distributions that we anticipate to receive from the joint venture may be more consistent as result of our distribution preferences. The improved financial results across periods is partially attributable to the decision to transition the property manager in April 2016 at the five properties owned through the Windsor Manor joint venture.\nIncome Tax Expense. For each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized state income tax expense related to our properties of approximately $0.4 million.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net loss attributable to our co-venture partners was approximately $0.1 million and $0.04 million, respectively. In accordance with the provisions of each joint venture agreement, we allocate loss from operations to our co-venture partners based on their percentage ownership in each joint venture. These losses are primarily related to our Watercrest at Katy joint venture, which completed the final phase of construction in July 2016.\nFiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014\nAs of December 31, 2015, we owned 132 consolidated real estate investment properties and our portfolio consisted of 5,253 units operated under management agreements with third-party operators and approximately 5.5 million leasable square feet that was 95.7% leased to third-party tenants.\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Investment count as of\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated operating investment types:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seniors housing leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Seniors housing managed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical office leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Post-acute care leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acute care leased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental Income from Operating Leases. Rental income from operating leases was approximately $101.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $49.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in rental income from operating leases resulted from our acquisition of five leased seniors housing communities, 22 MOBs, one post-acute care hospital and one acute care hospital for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as the 15 MOBs, three post-acute care hospitals and three acute care hospitals during the year ended December 31, 2014 being owned for the entire period.\nResident Fees and Services. Resident fees and services income was approximately $183.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $123.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in resident fees and services is a result of the 10 managed seniors housing communities acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as 14 managed seniors housing communities acquired during the year ended December 31, 2014 being owned for the entire period. In addition, Dogwood Forest of Acworth and HarborChase of Villages Crossing represent two of our completed developments that have reached stabilization during 2015. Moreover, HarborChase of Shorewood and Wellmore of Tega Cay were placed into service in November 2015 and June 2015, respectively.\nTenant Reimbursement Income. Tenant reimbursement income was approximately $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This amount is comprised of CAM revenue and the increase resulted from our acquisition of 22 MOBs, one post-acute care hospital and one acute care hospital acquired during the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as the 15 MOBs, three post-acute care hospitals and three acute care hospitals acquired during the year ended December 31, 2014 being owned for the entire period.\nInterest Income on Note Receivable from Related Party. Interest income on note receivable from related party was approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This amount is comprised of interest income on the acquisition, development and construction loan ( ADC loan\u201d) made to C4 Development, LLC for the HCA Rutland development in June 2013, which was fully repaid in August 2014. We recorded no interest income on note receivable from related party for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProperty Operating Expenses. Property operating expenses were approximately $149.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $93.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is a result of our acquisition of 10 managed seniors housing communities, 22 MOBs, one post-acute care hospital and one acute care hospital for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as 14 managed seniors housing communities, 15 MOBs, three post-acute care hospitals and three acute care hospitals acquired during the year ended December 31, 2014 being owned for the entire period. In addition, Dogwood Forest of Acworth and HarborChase of Villages Crossing represent two of our completed developments that have reached stabilization during 2015. Moreover, HarborChase of Shorewood and Wellmore of Tega Cay were placed into service in November 2015 and June 2015, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $10.1 million as compared to approximately $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. General and administrative expenses were comprised primarily of personnel expenses of affiliates of our Advisor, directors' and officers' insurance, franchise taxes, accounting and legal fees, and board of director fees and will continue to grow as our asset base increases. The increase in general and administrative expense was primarily attributed to increased costs as a result of the growth of our portfolio. Specifically, we incurred increased personnel expenses reimbursable to the Advisor due to increased accounting, legal and administrative activity as a result of the growth of the portfolio and related reporting.\nAcquisition Fees and Expenses. Acquisition fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $25.7 million of which approximately $4.2 million was capitalized as real estate under development. We incurred approximately $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 of which approximately $3.6 million was capitalized as real estate under development. The decrease in acquisition fees and expenses resulted from the acquisition of 39 operating properties totaling approximately $880.9 million in investments during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with the acquisition of 35 operating properties totaling approximately $905.3 million in investments during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAsset Management Fees. We incurred approximately $22.9 million in asset management fees payable to our Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to approximately $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, in asset management fees were settled in accordance with the terms of the Original Expense Support Agreements and approximately $0.6 million and $0.3 million, respectively, were capitalized as real estate under development. Monthly asset management fees equal to 0.08334% of invested assets are paid to the Advisor for management of our real estate assets, including our pro rata share of our investments in unconsolidated entities, loans and other permitted investments.\nProperty Management Fees. We incurred approximately $18.4 million in property management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately $3.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, were capitalized as real estate under development. Property management fees generally range from 2% to 5% of property revenues for leased properties depending on the type of property and are generally paid to third-party managers. In addition, an oversight fee equal to 1% of property revenues is paid to the Property Manager for those properties managed by a third-party. Overall property management fees increased as a result of the increases in rental income from operating leases and resident fees and services from acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as the properties acquired during 2014 being owned for the entire year ended December 31, 2015.\nImpairment Provision. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an impairment provision of $4.7 million to write-off the lease intangibles related to two of our specialty hospitals, as it was determined that the carrying value of these assets would not be recoverable; refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Tenant Workouts\u201d for additional information. There were no impairments during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nLoss on Lease Termination. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a loss on lease termination of $0.9 million related to two of our specialty hospitals, as it was determined that the carrying value of certain deferred rent and lease incentives would not be recoverable; refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Tenant Workouts\u201d for additional information. There were no losses on lease terminations during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nContingent purchase price consideration adjustment. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the adjustments for contingent purchase price consideration were both approximately $0.6 million. The adjustment in 2015 relates primarily to two separate acquisitions. Based on lower than expected occupancy and revised projections of future net operating income, our fair value estimate for our Capital Health yield guaranty receivable was increased by approximately $0.3 million and we recorded a reduction to our operating loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, as a result of the expiration of the Chestnut Commons Earn-Out agreement, we recorded a fair value adjustment of approximately $0.3 million during 2015. Based on lower than expected occupancy and revised projections of future net operating income, our fair value estimate for our Capital Health Yield Guaranty receivable was increased by approximately $2.2 million and we recorded a reduction to our operating loss in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, based on exceeding certain NOI targets on one of the South Bay II communities, we have recognized $1.8 million of expense during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were approximately $105.9 million and approximately $63.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization expenses are comprised of depreciation and amortization of the buildings, equipment, land improvements and in-place leases related to our real estate portfolio. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense across periods resulted from our acquisition of five leased seniors housing communities, 10 managed seniors housing communities, 22 MOBs, one post-acute care hospital and one acute care hospital for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as 14 managed seniors housing communities, 15 MOBs, three post-acute care hospitals and three acute care hospitals acquired during the year ended December 31, 2014 being owned for the entire period. In addition, HarborChase of Shorewood, Wellmore of Tega Cay, Dogwood Forest of Acworth and HarborChase of Villages Crossing were placed into service in November 2015, June 2015, June 2014 and December 2013, respectively.\nInterest Expense and Loan Cost Amortization. Interest expense and loan cost amortization for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $45.3 million of which $2.3 million was capitalized as development costs relating to our real estate under development. Interest expense and loan cost amortization for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $31.5 million of which approximately $1.0 million was capitalized as development costs relating to our real estate under development. Approximately $9.8 million of the increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding to approximately $1.3 billion as compared to approximately $0.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred approximately $0.8 million in additional loan costs amortization relating to debt obtained during the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as approximately $0.9 million relating to debt obtained on properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a write-off of approximately $0.7 million in loan costs and paid approximately $0.3 million on the derecognition of cash flow hedges in connection with the early extinguishment of debt on the Perennial Communities, Medical Portfolio I Properties, Dogwood Forest of Acworth and HarborChase of Villages Crossing.\nEquity in Earnings (Loss) of Unconsolidated Entities. Our unconsolidated entities generated losses of approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to our investment in the Windsor Manor joint venture, as compared to earnings of approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 relating to our investments in the Windsor Manor and Montecito joint ventures. Equity in loss from unconsolidated entities is determined using the HLBV method of accounting, which can create significant variability in earnings or loss from the joint venture while the preferred cash distributions that we anticipate to receive from the joint venture may be more consistent as result of our distribution preferences.\nGain from Purchase of Controlling Interest of Investment in Unconsolidated Entity. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized a gain of approximately $2.8 million related to the purchase of our co-venture partner's 10% interest in the Montecito joint venture which resulted in us controlling the property. There was no purchase of any controlling interest of unconsolidated entities during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. For each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized state income tax expense related to our properties of approximately $0.4 million.\nNet Operating Income\nWe generally expect to meet future cash needs for general and administrative expenses, debt service and distributions from NOI. We define NOI, a non-GAAP measure, as rental income from operating leases, resident fees and services, tenant reimbursement income and interest income less the property operating expenses and property management fees. We use NOI as a key performance metric for internal monitoring and planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets and monthly operating reviews, as well as to facilitate analysis of future investment and business decisions. It does not represent cash flows provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of our operating performance or to be an alternative to cash flows provided by operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. We believe the presentation of this non-GAAP measure is important to the understanding of our operating results for the periods presented because it is an indicator of the return on property investment and provides a method of comparing property performance over time. In addition, we have aggregated NOI on a same-store\u201d basis only for comparable properties that we have owned during the entirety of all periods presented. As such, Non-same-store NOI represents aggregated NOI from acquisitions made after the first day of the period presented (i.e. January 1, 2015 or January 1, 2014), which are excluded from Same-store NOI, as we did not own those properties during the entirety of all periods presented. In understanding our operating results in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, it is important to understand how the growth in our assets has impacted our results.\nThe chart below illustrates our net losses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands) and the amount invested in properties as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,784)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (68,093)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted to exclude:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Contingent purchase price consideration adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (290)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (589)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss on lease terminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Other expenses, net of other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Non-same-store NOI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,010)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,009)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Same-store NOI\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 119,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Invested in operating properties, end of period (in millions)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, our NOI for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $37.8 million, of which $34.0 million was related to 40 operating properties acquired after January 1, 2015, five developments completed after January 1, 2015 and the Dogwood Forest of Acworth property, which was sold in November 2016. Our same-store NOI for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $3.8 million, or 3.3%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in same-store NOI is primarily attributable to year-over-year revenue and occupancy growth within our seniors housing properties - specifically, our Pacific Northwest Communities and Capital Health Communities. However, the overall increase in same-store NOI at the aforementioned properties was partially offset by our decision to convert certain skilled nursing units to assisted living units at our Isle at Cedar Ridge and Isle at Watercrest - Bryan communities. While this decision adversely impacted same-store NOI for the year ended December 31, 2016, we anticipate that the converted units, which were completed in the third quarter of 2016, will contribute to same-store NOI growth in future periods and could increase the value of the properties.\nThe chart below illustrates our net losses and NOI for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands), and the amount invested in properties as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (68,093)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (52,511)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted to exclude:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Asset management fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Contingent purchase price consideration adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (589)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (630)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss on lease terminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Other expenses, net of other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NOI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Non-same-store NOI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,852)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,300)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Same-store NOI\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Invested in operating properties,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> end of period (in millions)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, our NOI for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $57.5 million, of which $52.6 million was related to 74 operating properties acquired between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015 as well as three developments completed between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. Our same-store NOI for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $4.9 million, or 8.9%, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in same-store NOI was primarily attributable to year-over-year revenue and occupancy growth within our seniors housing properties - specifically, our Pacific Northwest Communities and HarborChase of Villages Crossing, which represents a development completed in 2013 that reached stabilization during 2015.\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nDue to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, as discussed below, the NAREIT promulgated a measure known as FFO, which we believe to be an appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a REIT. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. FFO is not equivalent to net income or loss as determined under GAAP.\nWe define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT. NAREIT defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, real estate asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate related assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT's policy described above.\nThe historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant circumstances and/or is requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value of the property. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation may be less informative. Historical accounting for real estate involves the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization, provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income or loss. However, FFO and MFFO, as described below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or loss in its applicability in evaluating operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.\nChanges in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses for business combinations from a capitalization/depreciation model) to an expensed-as-incurred model that were put into effect in 2009, and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP and accounted for as operating expenses. Our management believes these fees and expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. While other start up entities may also experience significant acquisition activity during their initial years, we believe that non-listed REITs are unique in that they have a limited life with targeted exit strategies within a relatively limited time frame after acquisition activity ceases. Due to the above factors and other unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA has standardized a measure known as MFFO which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate with a limited life and targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance after the period in which we acquired our properties and once our portfolio is in place. By providing MFFO, we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our properties have been acquired. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry.\nWe define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: MFFO, or the Practice Guideline, issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice\nGuideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income or loss: acquisition fees and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which are adjusted from a GAAP accrual basis in order to reflect such payments on a cash basis of amounts expected to be received for such lease and rental payments); contingent purchase price consideration adjustments; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income or loss; gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan; and unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income or loss in calculating the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized.\nOur MFFO calculation complies with the IPA's Practice Guideline described above. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income or loss. These expenses are paid in cash by us. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase price of the property.\nOur management uses MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs which have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies shortly thereafter. As noted above, MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we do not continue to operate in this manner. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed REITs, such as their limited life, limited and defined acquisition period and targeted exit strategy, and hence that the use of such measures is useful to investors. For example, acquisition costs are funded from our subscription proceeds and other financing sources and not from operations. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information consistent with management's analysis of the operating performance of the properties.\nPresentation of this information is intended to provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different non-listed REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way and as such comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flows available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, or income or loss from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations, as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with other GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and NAV is disclosed. FFO and MFFO are not useful measures in evaluating NAV because impairments are taken into account in determining NAV but not in determining FFO and MFFO.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or another regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands, except per share data):\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss attributable to common stockholders\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,667)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (68,055)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (52,511)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 122,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,112\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairment provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> FFO adjustments from unconsolidated entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,994\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Gain on sale of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,415)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Gain on purchase of controlling interest of investment\nin unconsolidated entity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,798)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total funds from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,797\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition fees and expenses (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,526\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,931\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent adjustments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,251)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,309)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,472)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of above and below market intangibles (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized loss from mark-to-market adjustments on swaps (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on lease terminations (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent purchase price consideration adjustment (8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (290)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (589)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (630)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO adjustments from unconsolidated entities (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Modified funds from operations\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average number of shares of common\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> stock outstanding (basic and diluted) (9)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 153,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,710\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share (basic and diluted)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.18)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.44)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.61)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FFO per share (basic and diluted)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> MFFO per share (basic and diluted)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.37\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\nFOOTNOTES:\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> This amount represents our share of the FFO or MFFO adjustments allowable under the NAREIT or IPA definitions, respectively, calculated using the HLBV method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> In evaluating investments in real estate, management differentiates the costs to acquire the investment from the operations derived from the investment.

In connection therewith, the joint venture paid an exit fee of approximately $0.5 million upon extinguishment of the mortgage loans. The new loan included an initial five year term with monthly principal and interest payments based upon a 25-year amortization and a variable interest rate equal to London Interbank Offer Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus 3.5%. In addition, in connection with the refinancing, our Windsor Manor joint venture received aggregate proceeds of $22.0 million, of which approximately $0.4 million were used to pay loan costs associated with the refinancing and the remaining $3.6 million were available for capital distribution to the members. Our Windsor Manor joint venture declared capital distributions of $2.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, to us and our joint venture partner as a return of capital. These capital distributions were paid to the respective members in the third quarter of 2014.\nDuring 2015 and through the second quarter of 2016, the Windsor Manor joint venture did not meet its quarterly debt service coverage requirement per the loan agreement as the debt service coverage ratio fell below the 1.35 minimum requirement and the Windsor Manor joint venture obtained waivers from the lender for each reporting period during such period.\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately $20.8 million remained outstanding under the loan agreement, which is schedule to mature in June 2019.\nIn August 2014, we acquired our joint venture partner's 10% interest in the Montecito joint venture; refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d - Note 3. Acquisitions - Purchase of Controlling Interest in Montecito Joint Venture\u201d for additional information.\nRelated-Party Transactions\nWe have entered into agreements with our Advisor and its affiliates, whereby we agree to pay certain fees to, or reimburse certain expenses of, our Advisor or its affiliates for acquisition and advisory services, organization and offering costs, selling commissions, marketing support fees, asset and property management fees and reimbursement of operating costs. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data\u201d - Note 11. Related Party Arrangements\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies that management believes are critical. We consider these policies critical because they involve difficult management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Our most sensitive estimates will involve the allocation of the purchase price of acquired properties and evaluating our real estate-related investments for impairment.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation. Our consolidated financial statements will include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries or subsidiaries for which we have a controlling interest, the accounts of variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d) in which we are the primary beneficiary, and the accounts of other subsidiaries over which we have a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany accounts and transactions will be eliminated in consolidation.\nWe are required to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights and to determine the primary beneficiary of our VIEs. We qualitatively assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE and consider various factors including, but not limited to, the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and financial agreements, our ability and the rights of others to participate in policy making decisions, as well as our ability to replace the VIE manager and/or liquidate the entity.\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. For example, significant assumptions are made in the analysis of real estate impairments, the analysis of residual value and economic lives for leased properties, the valuation of contingent assets and liabilities, and the valuation of restricted stock shares issued to the Advisor or Property Manager. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nImpairment of Real Estate Assets. Real estate assets are reviewed on an ongoing basis to determine whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties (including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities) may be impaired. Factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include, among others: (i) significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; (ii) significant changes in the manner of use of our real estate assets or the strategy of our overall business; (iii) a significant increase in competition; (iv) a significant adverse change in legal factors or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, which could affect the value of our real estate assets; or (v) significant negative industry or economic trends. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we will assess potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the asset group, and from its eventual disposition, to the carrying amount of the asset group. Generally, an asset group is considered impaired if management's estimate of current and projected cash flows (undiscounted and unleveraged) of the asset group over its estimated holding period is less than the net carrying value of the asset group. Such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other factors. To the extent impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset group is adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the asset group.\nFor real estate we indirectly own through an investment in a joint venture, tenant-in-common interest or other similar investment structure and account for under the equity method, at each reporting date, we will compare the estimated fair value of our investment to the carrying value. An impairment charge will be recorded to the extent the fair value of our investment is less than the carrying amount and the decline in value is determined to be other than a temporary decline.\nIncome Taxes. To qualify as a REIT, we are subject to certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and will operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Notwithstanding our intent to be treated as a REIT, we may be subject to U.S. federal taxes on our TRS entities and will be subject to taxes in other jurisdictions such as state, local or foreign jurisdictions.\nShares Based Payments to Non-Employees. In connection with the Amended Expense Support Agreements, we may issue Restricted Stock to the Advisor or the Property Manager on an annual basis in exchange for providing expense support in the event that cash distributions declared exceed modified funds from operations as defined by the Amended Expense Support Agreements.\nThe Restricted Stock is forfeited if shareholders do not ultimately receive their original invested capital back with at least a 6% annualized return of investment upon a future liquidity or disposition event. Upon issuance of Restricted Stock, we measure the fair value at our then-current lowest aggregate fair value pursuant to the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 505-50. On the date in which the Advisor or the Property Manager satisfies the vesting criteria, we remeasure the fair value of the Restricted Stock pursuant to ASC 505-50 and record expense equal to the difference between the original fair value and that of the remeasurement date. In addition, given that performance is outside the control of the Advisor or the Property Manager and involves both market conditions and counterparty performance conditions, the shares are treated as unissued for accounting purposes and we only include the Restricted Stock in the calculation of diluted earnings per share to the extent their effect is dilutive and the vesting conditions have been satisfied as of the reporting date.\nPursuant to the Expense Support Agreements, the Advisor or the Property Manager shall be the record owner of the Restricted Stock until the shares of common stock are sold or otherwise disposed of, and shall be entitled to all of the rights of a stockholder including, without limitation, the right to vote such shares (to the extent permitted by the Articles) and receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such shares. All dividends or other distributions actually paid to the Advisor or the Property Manager in connection with the Restricted Stock shall vest immediately and will not be subject to forfeiture. We recognize expense related to the dividends on the Restricted Stock shares as declared.\nRevenue Recognition. Rental income from operating leases is recorded on the straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Our leases require the tenants to pay certain additional contractual amounts that are set aside by us for replacements of fixed assets and other improvements to the properties. These amounts are and will remain our property during and after the term of the lease. The amounts are recorded as capital improvement reserve income at the time that they are earned and are included in rental income from operating leases in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Additional percentage rent that is due contingent upon tenant performance thresholds, such as gross revenues, is deferred until the underlying performance thresholds have been achieved.\nResident fees and services consist of monthly services, which include rent, assistance and other related services. Agreements with residents are generally for an initial term of three months and are cancelable by the residents with 30 days' notice.\nTenant reimbursement income represents amounts tenants are required to reimburse us in accordance with the terms of the leases and are recognized in the period in which the related reimbursable expenses are incurred.\nInterest income is recognized on an accrual basis when earned. Any deferred portion of contractual interest is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the corresponding note receivable. Loan origination fees incurred are recognized as a reduction in interest income over the term of the note receivable.\nImpact of Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Item 8.

We qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2012 and our intention is to be organized and operate in a manner that allows us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nFrom July 2011 to September 2015, we raised approximately $1.7 billion through our Offerings. The net proceeds from our Offerings were contributed to CHP Partners, LP, our Operating Partnership, in exchange for partnership interests. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all operations are conducted, either directly or indirectly, through: (1) the Operating Partnership in which we are the sole limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, CHP GP, LLC, is the sole general partner; (2) a wholly owned TRS, CHP TRS Holding, Inc.; (3) property owner subsidiaries and lender subsidiaries, which are single purpose entities; and (4) investments in joint ventures.\nOn September 30, 2015, we completed our Offerings pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933 with the SEC. In October 2015, we deregistered the unsold shares of our common stock under our previous registration statement on Form S-11, except for 20 million shares that we concurrently registered on Form S-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 with the SEC for the sale of additional shares of common stock through our Reinvestment Plan.\nOur Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, recommending and executing acquisitions and dispositions on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement. Our Property Manager is responsible for managing and leasing our healthcare real estate investments. Our Advisor and Property Manager are each wholly owned by affiliates of our Sponsor, which is an affiliate of CNL, a private investment management firm providing global real estate and alternative investments. As a result, our Advisor and Property Manager each represent related parties and each have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing of our business.\nFor a description of the individual property holdings by asset class included in our healthcare real estate portfolio, including the location, date acquired, and purchase price, as of December 31, 2016, see Item 2. Properties.\u201d\nMarket Opportunities and Trends\nWe believe that medical care will continue to grow rapidly and steadily for two basic reasons-it is an essential human service for an aging demographic and it is heavily supported by the government. These factors may result in healthcare-related property investments potentially experiencing less economic volatility than other sectors.\nIn addition, there are indications that significant opportunities for consolidation exist in the seniors housing and healthcare facility sectors, which we believe will create value as our portfolio grows and achieves scale through asset aggregation. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research Report entitled Healthcare REITs: a defensive play on aging demographics\u201d dated September 24, 2013 ( BofA Report\u201d) estimates that the total value of healthcare-related real estate ranges from $700 billion to over $1 trillion, with REIT ownership accounting for only about 14% of the total. This continued ownership fragmentation of the healthcare property industry provides adequate opportunity for growth through consolidation opportunities.\nThe specific trends and characteristics unique to the healthcare sector and the asset classes on which we focus are described in greater detail below.\nDemand Drivers for Healthcare Property\nThe primary drivers behind demand for seniors housing, medical office, acute care and post-acute care properties are the aging of the U.S. population and growth in national healthcare expenditures.\nExpanded Healthcare Insurance Coverage. As the U.S. population over the age of 65 increases, more Americans become entitled to Medicare to cover their increasing healthcare needs and related costs. In addition, under The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Affordable Care Act\u201d) and other legislation, healthcare insurance coverage has expanded in recent years to cover more of the non-elderly, lower income populations. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, less than 9 percent of the population did not have health insurance coverage at the beginning of 2016, down from 16 percent at the time the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. The resulting expansion of U.S. healthcare insurance coverage has created an increase in demand for healthcare services and healthcare facilities of all types. There is a risk however that the Affordable Care Act could be repealed in the future and may be replaced with new legislation, the effects of which are unknown at this time. The impact of repealing existing legislation, or introducing new legislation, could materially increase the uninsured population in the U.S. who are not able to obtain or afford health insurance coverage. We believe efforts to preserve and increase access to care will remain a primary focus of the new administration.\nThe Aging of America. According to a December 2014 report of the U.S. Census Bureau, 12,000 people in the United States will turn 65 every day until 2060. Most recent US Census Bureau projections (as of December 2014) estimate that by 2060, 98 million Americans , or 23.6% of the U.S. population, will be 65 years or older, compared to 14.9% of the population in 2015, an anticipated increase of 105% in the senior population between 2015 and 2060. The graph below depicts the projected increase in the size of the senior population in the United States over time based upon national population projections by the U.S. Census Bureau:\nSource: US Census Bureau, December 2014\nDisability is defined under the ADA as a substantial limitation in a major life activity. Research indicates that age is positively correlated with the presence of a physical disability, and the oldest people have the highest levels of both physical and cognitive disabilities. With the increasing age of the U.S. population, the healthcare system faces an increase in the population with age-related physical and cognitive disabilities, which require increased supportive health care services as well as housing options for older adults. Additionally, we expect an increased demand for healthcare facilities providing physician and ancillary care services for such disabilities.\nRising Healthcare Expenditures. The rise in the aging population, the expansion of U.S. healthcare insurance coverage through Medicare or other means, and medical technology innovations contribute to increasing healthcare expenditures. National healthcare spending is projected to increase from approximately 16 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 to approximately 25 percent by 2040 according to The 2015 Long-Term Budget Outlook\u201d, produced by the Congressional Budget Office in June 2015.\nThe following graph depicts the projected rise in the national healthcare expenditures in the U.S. between 2000 and 2025:\nSource: 1- National Health Expenditure Projections 2015-2025,\u201d The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary, National Health Statistics Group. 2-GDP Projections from An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016-2026\u201d, Congressional Budget Office, August 2016.\nAs Americans age, they spend more on healthcare. The following graph depicts the increase in average annual per capita spending by Americans on healthcare as they age.\nSource: Health Expenditures by Age and Gender,\u201d The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2012.\nSeniors Housing and Post-Acute Care Supply and Demand\nDemographics and Existing Units. According to a National Center for Health Statistics report entitled Health: United States, 2015\u201d dated May 2016, individuals who are 65 years old in 2014 can expect to live, on average, an additional 19.3 years, up from an average of 13.9 additional years for those aged 65 in 1950 - a net gain of 5.4 years. Americans 65 years and older have longer life expectancies than the elderly did in the past and will therefore need additional housing options to accommodate their special needs as they age. Demand for seniors housing options is currently outpacing the existing supply of seniors housing units. According to the ASHA Special Issue Brief: A Projection of Demand for Market Rate U.S. Seniors Housing 2015-2040, American Seniors Housing Association, Winter 2016, the projected annual demand growth for seniors housing will increase as baby boomers\u201d pass the over-75 age-threshold after 2020, increasing from the level of 25,000 units per year from 2015 to 2020 to a demand of 92,000 units per year from 2025 to 2030. The ASHA Special Issue Brief projects that approximately 1.8 million senior living units need to be constructed by 2040 to accommodate aging Americans at the same market penetration rate encountered today.\nSource: A Projection of Demand for Market Rate U.S. Seniors Housing 2015-2040, American Seniors Housing Association, Winter 2016.\nThe supply growth of certain seniors housing asset classes over the last decade declined following a boom in seniors housing development in the 1990's. Since 2008, there has been modest growth in the total national inventory of seniors housing units according to National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care ( NIC\u201d) data, with a compound annual growth rate of 2.0% for seniors housing facilities as of the end of 2016. However, the number of new seniors housing units under construction is increasing. Muted supply growth has helped rental levels recover and occupancy improve despite a modest economic recovery. The following graph depicts seniors housing supply-demand trends for independent living and assisted living combined:\nSource: National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, NIC MAP Property Trend, Q4-2016\nAccording to data from the NIC for the fourth quarter of 2016, overall seniors housing occupancy in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas ( MSAs\u201d) was 89.4%. As of the fourth quarter of 2016, occupancy was 3.1 percentage points above its cyclical low of 87.1% during the first quarter of 2010. In 2016, inventory of seniors housing units grew by 27,076 units. This growth in inventory has contributed to a decline in overall occupancy by 0.6 percentage points from year end 2015. We believe seniors housing development will remain at an acceptable level given the growth in aging demographics, and that sufficient demand exists to absorb the new development units over time.\nRise in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. According to a study funded by the Alzheimer's Association and NIH/National Institute on Aging, the number of people in the U.S. with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple by 2050, straining our healthcare system and taxing the resources of caregivers. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or slow the disease, approximately 13.8 million people age 65 and older are projected to have Alzheimer's disease by 2050. The following graph depicts the projected rise in the number of senior population with Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. broken down by three age groups.\nSource: Hebert LE, Weuve J, Scherr PA, Evans DA. Alzheimer disease in the United States (2010-2050) estimated using the 2010 Census. .\nAccording to a National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief dated November 2013, in 2010, approximately 42% of individuals living in residential care communities had Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. We believe that the projected rise in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease creates a need for seniors housing options that address the specialized needs of Alzheimer's and other dementia patients and their families, which often cannot be addressed in a traditional home setting.\nStronger U.S. Housing Market. As the broader economy recovers and the U.S. residential real estate market strengthens, it is widely believed that the demand for seniors housing will continue to grow as the baby boomer\u201d generation reaches retirement and transitions to active adult communities and other seniors housing facilities. Seniors often sell their homes and use the proceeds to pay rent in private-pay retirement communities creating a strong correlation between seniors housing demand and home prices. According to data from a December 2016 report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University ( Joint Center Report\u201d), the number of households headed by seniors will increase more than 60% over the next two decades. As the senior population ages into their late 70s and this segment of the population grows, they tend to seek more accessible and convenient living options. The Joint Center Report states the sheer growth in the older population will mean the number of renter households will expand from 6 to more than 11 million households over the next two decades. Overall, the share of renters will increase slightly, from 21 percent of older households in 2015 to 23 percent in 2035.\nSeniors Housing and Post-Acute Care Asset Classes\nBased on the above fundamentals and perceived trends, we may invest in or develop the following classes of seniors housing and post-acute care properties:\nSeniors Housing Communities\nActive Adult Communities. Active adult communities offer social and recreational-centered living in a setting that may include town homes, condominiums, cluster homes, manufactured housing, single family homes and multi-family housing. These communities are generally classified as either: (a) age-restricted communities that require at least one household member to be over the age of 55 in at least 80% of the occupied units; or (b) age-targeted communities that target adults age 55 or older with no explicit age restrictions. Residents typically lead independent, active lifestyles in a country club setting where they can take advantage of amenities such as a clubhouse, gathering center or recreational center that is the focal point of activities, and may include a golf course, walking trails, hobby centers or other recreational spaces. These communities are generally not equipped to provide increased care or health-related services.\nIndependent Living Facilities. Independent living facilities are age-restricted, multi-family rental or ownership (condominium) housing with central dining facilities that provide residents, as part of a monthly fee, meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation, social and recreational activities.\nAssisted Living Facilities. Assisted living facilities are usually state-regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but also provide, in a majority of the units, supportive care from trained employees to residents who are unable to live independently and require assistance with activities of daily living. The additional services may include assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, and administering medications.\nContinuing Care Retirement Communities. Continuing care retirement communities offer age-restricted seniors housing facilities with a combination of independent living lifestyle options for individuals who do not need constant physician or nursing supervision and assisted living or skilled nursing facilities available to residents on the same or adjacent property of the complex. This type of community generally offers a longer term contract for seniors that provides for housing, services and nursing care with varying payment plans that may include entrance fees and condominium or cooperative rental programs. In general, these properties provide residential living in an apartment-style building with services and dining usually on the main level. In addition, those in a campus-like setting of several acres may offer other individual multi-family homes and offer amenities that may be similar to those found in an active adult community.\nMemory Care/Alzheimer's Facilities. Those suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of memory loss need specialized care. Memory care/Alzheimer's centers provide the specialized care for this population including residential housing and assistance with the activities of daily living.\nPost-Acute Care Properties\nSkilled Nursing Facilities. A skilled nursing facility generally provides the highest level of care for older adults outside of a hospital and also provides custodial care and assistance with the activities of daily living. Skilled nursing facilities differ from other seniors housing facilities in that they also provide a high level of medical care. A licensed physician supervises each patient's care and a nurse or other medical professional is almost always on the premises. Skilled nursing care is available on site, usually 24 hours a day. Other medical professionals, such as occupational or physical therapists, are also available. This allows the delivery of medical procedures and therapies on site that would not be possible in other housing options.\nLong-Term Acute Care Hospitals. Long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACHs, are certified as acute care hospitals, but focus on patients who, on average, stay more than 25 days. Many of the patients in LTACHs are transferred from a hospital-based intensive or critical care unit. LTACHs specialize in treating patients who may have more than one serious condition, but who may improve with time and care and eventually return home. Services provided in LTACHs typically include comprehensive rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment and pain management.\nInpatient Rehabilitative Facilities. Inpatient rehabilitative facilities are licensed facilities that provide intensive rehabilitation programs to patients who typically have complex medical issues resulting from incidents of trauma or strokes. They focus on providing high levels of physical, occupational and speech therapy under the supervision of highly trained medical doctors, staff and therapists.\nMedical Office Building and Acute Care Property Supply and Demand\nDemographics and Existing Space. The increased demand for medical office buildings, acute care and post-acute care properties is also supported by an aging population and increased health insurance coverage. As Americans 65 years and older have longer life expectancies than in the past, their need for health related services is projected to increase the need for additional healthcare properties. In 2012, persons over age 65 were 14 percent of the U.S. population but accounted for 27 percent of physician visits in the U.S. According to the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, individuals over age 65 made an average of 5.9 visits to physicians' offices in 2012, or 2.7 times the number of visits made by individuals under 45 years of age. The graph below depicts the average number of physicians' visits in the U.S. by age group in 2012.\nSource: CDC/NCHS, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2012\nEvolution of the U.S. Healthcare Model. Rising healthcare costs create pressure within the healthcare industry to move from an inpatient to an outpatient delivery setting in order to provide service more efficiently and contain costs. The outpatient model of healthcare services results in declining hospital admissions and overnight stays with a focus toward performing certain procedures and diagnostic services in a more consumer-centric, cost-effective setting. According to the Urban Land Institute Report, almost 65% of all surgeries today do not require an overnight hospital stay, compared with only 16% of all surgeries in 1980. Technology advances are also driving patient demand for more medical services and the space in which to deliver them. The shift to outpatient surgeries also continues to be encouraged by technological advances that involve smaller incisions, improved anesthetics, less risk of infection and faster recoveries. The increase in outpatient procedures drives greater demand for medical office buildings and other healthcare properties in which such procedures can be performed.\nThe following graph depicts the increase in outpatient surgeries vs. inpatient surgeries in the United States under the new, evolving U.S. healthcare model:\nSource: Trendwatch Chartbook 2016: American Hospital Association\nConsumer-Driven Healthcare Model. Today's patients often select their doctors based not only on the quality of care offered but also on the ease of access to such doctors. Hospitals are therefore expanding into community-based settings and encouraging large practices to open satellite offices. According to the Medical Office Research Report\u201d published by Marcus & Millichap in 2013, this bodes well for medical office building owners, as many providers, including physician practices affiliated with or owned by major health systems, will favor well-located, multi-tenant medical office buildings, particularly those with tenant rosters that promote cross-referrals. At the same time, however, some share of tenant demand will be diverted to storefront clinics and large ambulatory care centers.\nMedical Office Buildings and Acute Care Property Asset Classes\nBased on the increased numbers of insured Americans, increased healthcare visits by a growing, aging U.S. population and an evolving U.S. healthcare model driving a need for additional healthcare properties, we may invest in or develop the following classes of medical office buildings, acute care properties and other healthcare-related properties:\nMedical Office Buildings. These properties include traditional medical office buildings, specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities, surgery centers, outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other facilities designated for clinical services. The buildings may be located on the campus of a hospital, adjacent to campus, or as a hub and spoke\u201d location whereby the hospital desires to establish a presence in a particular market. Medical office buildings may also be unaffiliated with a health system and could be multi-tenant or single-tenant in nature.\nAcute Care Properties. These properties include specialty hospitals which are primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of patients having a cardiac or orthopedic condition or patients undergoing a surgical procedure. General acute care hospitals also fall within the category of acute care properties and offer a variety of services including operating and recovery rooms, imaging and diagnostic services, delivery and neonatal care, oncology services, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy and other outpatient services.\nOther Healthcare-Related Properties\nOther healthcare-related properties in which we believe there are opportunities based on current supply and demand factors are pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturing facilities, laboratories, life-science and research facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary source of capital for items other than acquisitions of real estate, through the close of our Offerings on September 30, 2015, was proceeds we received from our Offerings. While our Offerings closed on September 30, 2015, we continue to provide existing stockholders the opportunity to designate their cash distributions for reinvestment through our Reinvestment Plan. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from collateralized or uncollateralized financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties, other assets and undistributed operating cash flows. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately $11.1 million of available proceeds remaining under our senior unsecured revolving line of credit ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nWe substantially completed our acquisition phase in 2016 and expect future acquisition activity to be limited. Prior to completion of our acquisition phase, our principal demand for funds has been for acquisitions, the payment of debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions. Generally, we expect to meet short-term working capital needs from our cash flows from operations and proceeds from our Reinvestment Plan.\nWe may also be negatively impacted by rising interest rates on any unhedged variable rate debt or the timing of when we seek to refinance existing debt. In addition, we will continue to evaluate the need for additional interest rate protection in the form of interest rate swaps or caps on unhedged variable rate debt.\nSources of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCommon Stock Offerings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from our Offerings of approximately $551.9 million and $554.6 million respectively.\nReinvestment Plan\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from our Reinvestment Plan of approximately $42.6 million, $36.8 million and $17.7 million respectively.\nBorrowings\nWe have borrowed and intend to continue borrowing money to fund ongoing real estate development and other enhancements to our portfolio, as well as to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we borrowed proceeds of approximately $142.5 million, $549.2 million and $510.3 million, respectively, net of repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility of $120.3 million, $321.4 million and $259.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts were primarily used to fund real estate under development and acquire additional properties. While we have substantially completed our acquisition phase, we may evaluate additional acquisition opportunities and borrow additional money to fund such acquisitions.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a $230 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $175 million senior unsecured term loan facility ( Term Loan Facility\u201d and, collectively, Credit Facilities\u201d). Pursuant to the associated credit agreement, we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity to $700 million under the accordion feature of the Credit Facilities. To date, we have exercised this accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity to $445 million. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility has an initial term through December 2017 plus two 12-month extension options through which we can extend the term through December 2019; whereas the Term Loan Facility has an initial term through February 2019 plus one 12-month extension option through which we can extend the term through February 2020. We expect to exercise one of our two 12-month extension options on the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the term through December 2018.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a $250 million senior unsecured term loan facility ( Second Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Second Term Loan Facility has an initial term through November 2020 and we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity to $350M under its accordion feature. To date, we have exercised this accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity to $275 million.\nIn March 2017, we obtained approximately $28 million of additional borrowings related to Wellmore of Tega Cay, which was an unencumbered asset as of December 31, 2016. The loan has an initial term of 36 months plus one 12-month extension option, an interest rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 2.65% per annum and a 12-month interest only period followed by a 30-year amortization for the remaining term of the loan.\nWe may borrow money to pay distributions to stockholders, for working capital and for other corporate purposes. See Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources - Distributions\u201d below for additional information related to the payment of distributions with Other Sources for GAAP purposes. In many cases, we have pledged our assets in connection with our borrowings and intend to encumber assets in connection with additional borrowings. The aggregate amount of long-term financing is not expected to exceed 60% of our total assets on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an aggregate debt leverage ratio of approximately 55.8% and 52.6%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of our assets.\nThe following table provides details of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\n\n_____________\nFOOTNOTES:\n (1) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts of approximately $521.5 million and $480.7 million, respectively, which were settling on a monthly basis. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 12. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d for additional information. \n (2) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our mortgages and other notes payable are collateralized by 75 and 65 properties, respectively, with total carrying values of approximately $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. \n (3) Premium (discount), net is reflective of us recording mortgage note payables assumed at fair value on the respective acquisition date. \n (4) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $11.1 million and $20.0 million, respectively, based on the value of the properties in the unencumbered pool of assets supporting the loan. \n (5) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we entered into interest rate caps with notional amounts of approximately $410.0 million and $260.0 million, respectively. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 12. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d for additional information. \nGenerally, the loan agreements for our mortgage loans contain customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, representations, warranties and borrowing conditions, as set forth in the loan agreements. The loan agreements also contain customary events of default and remedies for the lenders. The borrowers are normally direct or indirect subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership.\nThe Credit Facilities contain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants which are customary for loans of this type, including (but not limited to): (i) maximum leverage, (ii) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, (iii) minimum consolidated net worth, (iv) restrictions on payments of cash distributions except if required by REIT requirements, (v) maximum secured indebtedness, (vi) maximum secured recourse debt, (vii) minimum unsecured interest coverage and (viii) limitations on certain types of investments and with respect to the pool of properties supporting borrowings under the Credit Facilities, minimum debt service coverage ratio, minimum weighted average occupancy, and remaining lease terms, as well as property type, MSA, operator, and asset value concentration limits. The limitations on distributions include a limitation on the extent of allowable distributions, which are not to exceed the greater of 95% of adjusted FFO (as defined per the Credit Facilities) and the minimum amount of distributions required to maintain our REIT status. We do not expect this limitation to be a limiting factor for our board of directors when determining distribution levels now or in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and ratios.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 10. Indebtedness\u201d for additional information on our borrowings, including a schedule of future principal payments and maturity dates.

We qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes beginning with the year ended December 31, 2012 and our intention is to be organized and operate in a manner that allows us to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nFrom July 2011 to September 2015, we raised approximately $1.7 billion through our Offerings. The net proceeds from our Offerings were contributed to CHP Partners, LP, our Operating Partnership, in exchange for partnership interests. Substantially all of our assets are held by, and all operations are conducted, either directly or indirectly, through: (1) the Operating Partnership in which we are the sole limited partner and our wholly owned subsidiary, CHP GP, LLC, is the sole general partner; (2) a wholly owned TRS, CHP TRS Holding, Inc.; (3) property owner subsidiaries and lender subsidiaries, which are single purpose entities; and (4) investments in joint ventures.\nOn September 30, 2015, we completed our Offerings pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933 with the SEC. In October 2015, we deregistered the unsold shares of our common stock under our previous registration statement on Form S-11, except for 20 million shares that we concurrently registered on Form S-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 with the SEC for the sale of additional shares of common stock through our Reinvestment Plan.\nOur Advisor is responsible for managing our affairs on a day-to-day basis and for identifying, recommending and executing acquisitions and dispositions on our behalf pursuant to an advisory agreement. Our Property Manager is responsible for managing and leasing our healthcare real estate investments. Our Advisor and Property Manager are each wholly owned by affiliates of our Sponsor, which is an affiliate of CNL, a private investment management firm providing global real estate and alternative investments. As a result, our Advisor and Property Manager each represent related parties and each have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing of our business.\nFor a description of the individual property holdings by asset class included in our healthcare real estate portfolio, including the location, date acquired, and purchase price, as of December 31, 2016, see Item 2. Properties.\u201d\nMarket Opportunities and Trends\nWe believe that medical care will continue to grow rapidly and steadily for two basic reasons-it is an essential human service for an aging demographic and it is heavily supported by the government. These factors may result in healthcare-related property investments potentially experiencing less economic volatility than other sectors.\nIn addition, there are indications that significant opportunities for consolidation exist in the seniors housing and healthcare facility sectors, which we believe will create value as our portfolio grows and achieves scale through asset aggregation. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research Report entitled Healthcare REITs: a defensive play on aging demographics\u201d dated September 24, 2013 ( BofA Report\u201d) estimates that the total value of healthcare-related real estate ranges from $700 billion to over $1 trillion, with REIT ownership accounting for only about 14% of the total. This continued ownership fragmentation of the healthcare property industry provides adequate opportunity for growth through consolidation opportunities.\nThe specific trends and characteristics unique to the healthcare sector and the asset classes on which we focus are described in greater detail below.\nDemand Drivers for Healthcare Property\nThe primary drivers behind demand for seniors housing, medical office, acute care and post-acute care properties are the aging of the U.S. population and growth in national healthcare expenditures.\nExpanded Healthcare Insurance Coverage. As the U.S. population over the age of 65 increases, more Americans become entitled to Medicare to cover their increasing healthcare needs and related costs. In addition, under The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( Affordable Care Act\u201d) and other legislation, healthcare insurance coverage has expanded in recent years to cover more of the non-elderly, lower income populations. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, less than 9 percent of the population did not have health insurance coverage at the beginning of 2016, down from 16 percent at the time the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010. The resulting expansion of U.S. healthcare insurance coverage has created an increase in demand for healthcare services and healthcare facilities of all types. There is a risk however that the Affordable Care Act could be repealed in the future and may be replaced with new legislation, the effects of which are unknown at this time. The impact of repealing existing legislation, or introducing new legislation, could materially increase the uninsured population in the U.S. who are not able to obtain or afford health insurance coverage. We believe efforts to preserve and increase access to care will remain a primary focus of the new administration.\nThe Aging of America. According to a December 2014 report of the U.S. Census Bureau, 12,000 people in the United States will turn 65 every day until 2060. Most recent US Census Bureau projections (as of December 2014) estimate that by 2060, 98 million Americans , or 23.6% of the U.S. population, will be 65 years or older, compared to 14.9% of the population in 2015, an anticipated increase of 105% in the senior population between 2015 and 2060. The graph below depicts the projected increase in the size of the senior population in the United States over time based upon national population projections by the U.S. Census Bureau:\nSource: US Census Bureau, December 2014\nDisability is defined under the ADA as a substantial limitation in a major life activity. Research indicates that age is positively correlated with the presence of a physical disability, and the oldest people have the highest levels of both physical and cognitive disabilities. With the increasing age of the U.S. population, the healthcare system faces an increase in the population with age-related physical and cognitive disabilities, which require increased supportive health care services as well as housing options for older adults. Additionally, we expect an increased demand for healthcare facilities providing physician and ancillary care services for such disabilities.\nRising Healthcare Expenditures. The rise in the aging population, the expansion of U.S. healthcare insurance coverage through Medicare or other means, and medical technology innovations contribute to increasing healthcare expenditures. National healthcare spending is projected to increase from approximately 16 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 to approximately 25 percent by 2040 according to The 2015 Long-Term Budget Outlook\u201d, produced by the Congressional Budget Office in June 2015.\nThe following graph depicts the projected rise in the national healthcare expenditures in the U.S. between 2000 and 2025:\nSource: 1- National Health Expenditure Projections 2015-2025,\u201d The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Office of the Actuary, National Health Statistics Group. 2-GDP Projections from An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2016-2026\u201d, Congressional Budget Office, August 2016.\nAs Americans age, they spend more on healthcare. The following graph depicts the increase in average annual per capita spending by Americans on healthcare as they age.\nSource: Health Expenditures by Age and Gender,\u201d The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2012.\nSeniors Housing and Post-Acute Care Supply and Demand\nDemographics and Existing Units. According to a National Center for Health Statistics report entitled Health: United States, 2015\u201d dated May 2016, individuals who are 65 years old in 2014 can expect to live, on average, an additional 19.3 years, up from an average of 13.9 additional years for those aged 65 in 1950 - a net gain of 5.4 years. Americans 65 years and older have longer life expectancies than the elderly did in the past and will therefore need additional housing options to accommodate their special needs as they age. Demand for seniors housing options is currently outpacing the existing supply of seniors housing units. According to the ASHA Special Issue Brief: A Projection of Demand for Market Rate U.S. Seniors Housing 2015-2040, American Seniors Housing Association, Winter 2016, the projected annual demand growth for seniors housing will increase as baby boomers\u201d pass the over-75 age-threshold after 2020, increasing from the level of 25,000 units per year from 2015 to 2020 to a demand of 92,000 units per year from 2025 to 2030. The ASHA Special Issue Brief projects that approximately 1.8 million senior living units need to be constructed by 2040 to accommodate aging Americans at the same market penetration rate encountered today.\nSource: A Projection of Demand for Market Rate U.S. Seniors Housing 2015-2040, American Seniors Housing Association, Winter 2016.\nThe supply growth of certain seniors housing asset classes over the last decade declined following a boom in seniors housing development in the 1990's. Since 2008, there has been modest growth in the total national inventory of seniors housing units according to National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care ( NIC\u201d) data, with a compound annual growth rate of 2.0% for seniors housing facilities as of the end of 2016. However, the number of new seniors housing units under construction is increasing. Muted supply growth has helped rental levels recover and occupancy improve despite a modest economic recovery. The following graph depicts seniors housing supply-demand trends for independent living and assisted living combined:\nSource: National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care, NIC MAP Property Trend, Q4-2016\nAccording to data from the NIC for the fourth quarter of 2016, overall seniors housing occupancy in the top 100 metropolitan statistical areas ( MSAs\u201d) was 89.4%. As of the fourth quarter of 2016, occupancy was 3.1 percentage points above its cyclical low of 87.1% during the first quarter of 2010. In 2016, inventory of seniors housing units grew by 27,076 units. This growth in inventory has contributed to a decline in overall occupancy by 0.6 percentage points from year end 2015. We believe seniors housing development will remain at an acceptable level given the growth in aging demographics, and that sufficient demand exists to absorb the new development units over time.\nRise in the Prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. According to a study funded by the Alzheimer's Association and NIH/National Institute on Aging, the number of people in the U.S. with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple by 2050, straining our healthcare system and taxing the resources of caregivers. Barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent or slow the disease, approximately 13.8 million people age 65 and older are projected to have Alzheimer's disease by 2050. The following graph depicts the projected rise in the number of senior population with Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. broken down by three age groups.\nSource: Hebert LE, Weuve J, Scherr PA, Evans DA. Alzheimer disease in the United States (2010-2050) estimated using the 2010 Census. .\nAccording to a National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief dated November 2013, in 2010, approximately 42% of individuals living in residential care communities had Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. We believe that the projected rise in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease creates a need for seniors housing options that address the specialized needs of Alzheimer's and other dementia patients and their families, which often cannot be addressed in a traditional home setting.\nStronger U.S. Housing Market. As the broader economy recovers and the U.S. residential real estate market strengthens, it is widely believed that the demand for seniors housing will continue to grow as the baby boomer\u201d generation reaches retirement and transitions to active adult communities and other seniors housing facilities. Seniors often sell their homes and use the proceeds to pay rent in private-pay retirement communities creating a strong correlation between seniors housing demand and home prices. According to data from a December 2016 report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University ( Joint Center Report\u201d), the number of households headed by seniors will increase more than 60% over the next two decades. As the senior population ages into their late 70s and this segment of the population grows, they tend to seek more accessible and convenient living options. The Joint Center Report states the sheer growth in the older population will mean the number of renter households will expand from 6 to more than 11 million households over the next two decades. Overall, the share of renters will increase slightly, from 21 percent of older households in 2015 to 23 percent in 2035.\nSeniors Housing and Post-Acute Care Asset Classes\nBased on the above fundamentals and perceived trends, we may invest in or develop the following classes of seniors housing and post-acute care properties:\nSeniors Housing Communities\nActive Adult Communities. Active adult communities offer social and recreational-centered living in a setting that may include town homes, condominiums, cluster homes, manufactured housing, single family homes and multi-family housing. These communities are generally classified as either: (a) age-restricted communities that require at least one household member to be over the age of 55 in at least 80% of the occupied units; or (b) age-targeted communities that target adults age 55 or older with no explicit age restrictions. Residents typically lead independent, active lifestyles in a country club setting where they can take advantage of amenities such as a clubhouse, gathering center or recreational center that is the focal point of activities, and may include a golf course, walking trails, hobby centers or other recreational spaces. These communities are generally not equipped to provide increased care or health-related services.\nIndependent Living Facilities. Independent living facilities are age-restricted, multi-family rental or ownership (condominium) housing with central dining facilities that provide residents, as part of a monthly fee, meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation, social and recreational activities.\nAssisted Living Facilities. Assisted living facilities are usually state-regulated rental properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but also provide, in a majority of the units, supportive care from trained employees to residents who are unable to live independently and require assistance with activities of daily living. The additional services may include assistance with bathing, dressing, eating, and administering medications.\nContinuing Care Retirement Communities. Continuing care retirement communities offer age-restricted seniors housing facilities with a combination of independent living lifestyle options for individuals who do not need constant physician or nursing supervision and assisted living or skilled nursing facilities available to residents on the same or adjacent property of the complex. This type of community generally offers a longer term contract for seniors that provides for housing, services and nursing care with varying payment plans that may include entrance fees and condominium or cooperative rental programs. In general, these properties provide residential living in an apartment-style building with services and dining usually on the main level. In addition, those in a campus-like setting of several acres may offer other individual multi-family homes and offer amenities that may be similar to those found in an active adult community.\nMemory Care/Alzheimer's Facilities. Those suffering from the effects of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of memory loss need specialized care. Memory care/Alzheimer's centers provide the specialized care for this population including residential housing and assistance with the activities of daily living.\nPost-Acute Care Properties\nSkilled Nursing Facilities. A skilled nursing facility generally provides the highest level of care for older adults outside of a hospital and also provides custodial care and assistance with the activities of daily living. Skilled nursing facilities differ from other seniors housing facilities in that they also provide a high level of medical care. A licensed physician supervises each patient's care and a nurse or other medical professional is almost always on the premises. Skilled nursing care is available on site, usually 24 hours a day. Other medical professionals, such as occupational or physical therapists, are also available. This allows the delivery of medical procedures and therapies on site that would not be possible in other housing options.\nLong-Term Acute Care Hospitals. Long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACHs, are certified as acute care hospitals, but focus on patients who, on average, stay more than 25 days. Many of the patients in LTACHs are transferred from a hospital-based intensive or critical care unit. LTACHs specialize in treating patients who may have more than one serious condition, but who may improve with time and care and eventually return home. Services provided in LTACHs typically include comprehensive rehabilitation, respiratory therapy, head trauma treatment and pain management.\nInpatient Rehabilitative Facilities. Inpatient rehabilitative facilities are licensed facilities that provide intensive rehabilitation programs to patients who typically have complex medical issues resulting from incidents of trauma or strokes. They focus on providing high levels of physical, occupational and speech therapy under the supervision of highly trained medical doctors, staff and therapists.\nMedical Office Building and Acute Care Property Supply and Demand\nDemographics and Existing Space. The increased demand for medical office buildings, acute care and post-acute care properties is also supported by an aging population and increased health insurance coverage. As Americans 65 years and older have longer life expectancies than in the past, their need for health related services is projected to increase the need for additional healthcare properties. In 2012, persons over age 65 were 14 percent of the U.S. population but accounted for 27 percent of physician visits in the U.S. According to the 2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, individuals over age 65 made an average of 5.9 visits to physicians' offices in 2012, or 2.7 times the number of visits made by individuals under 45 years of age. The graph below depicts the average number of physicians' visits in the U.S. by age group in 2012.\nSource: CDC/NCHS, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2012\nEvolution of the U.S. Healthcare Model. Rising healthcare costs create pressure within the healthcare industry to move from an inpatient to an outpatient delivery setting in order to provide service more efficiently and contain costs. The outpatient model of healthcare services results in declining hospital admissions and overnight stays with a focus toward performing certain procedures and diagnostic services in a more consumer-centric, cost-effective setting. According to the Urban Land Institute Report, almost 65% of all surgeries today do not require an overnight hospital stay, compared with only 16% of all surgeries in 1980. Technology advances are also driving patient demand for more medical services and the space in which to deliver them. The shift to outpatient surgeries also continues to be encouraged by technological advances that involve smaller incisions, improved anesthetics, less risk of infection and faster recoveries. The increase in outpatient procedures drives greater demand for medical office buildings and other healthcare properties in which such procedures can be performed.\nThe following graph depicts the increase in outpatient surgeries vs. inpatient surgeries in the United States under the new, evolving U.S. healthcare model:\nSource: Trendwatch Chartbook 2016: American Hospital Association\nConsumer-Driven Healthcare Model. Today's patients often select their doctors based not only on the quality of care offered but also on the ease of access to such doctors. Hospitals are therefore expanding into community-based settings and encouraging large practices to open satellite offices. According to the Medical Office Research Report\u201d published by Marcus & Millichap in 2013, this bodes well for medical office building owners, as many providers, including physician practices affiliated with or owned by major health systems, will favor well-located, multi-tenant medical office buildings, particularly those with tenant rosters that promote cross-referrals. At the same time, however, some share of tenant demand will be diverted to storefront clinics and large ambulatory care centers.\nMedical Office Buildings and Acute Care Property Asset Classes\nBased on the increased numbers of insured Americans, increased healthcare visits by a growing, aging U.S. population and an evolving U.S. healthcare model driving a need for additional healthcare properties, we may invest in or develop the following classes of medical office buildings, acute care properties and other healthcare-related properties:\nMedical Office Buildings. These properties include traditional medical office buildings, specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities, surgery centers, outpatient rehabilitation facilities and other facilities designated for clinical services. The buildings may be located on the campus of a hospital, adjacent to campus, or as a hub and spoke\u201d location whereby the hospital desires to establish a presence in a particular market. Medical office buildings may also be unaffiliated with a health system and could be multi-tenant or single-tenant in nature.\nAcute Care Properties. These properties include specialty hospitals which are primarily or exclusively engaged in the care and treatment of patients having a cardiac or orthopedic condition or patients undergoing a surgical procedure. General acute care hospitals also fall within the category of acute care properties and offer a variety of services including operating and recovery rooms, imaging and diagnostic services, delivery and neonatal care, oncology services, clinical laboratory services, physical therapy and other outpatient services.\nOther Healthcare-Related Properties\nOther healthcare-related properties in which we believe there are opportunities based on current supply and demand factors are pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturing facilities, laboratories, life-science and research facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary source of capital for items other than acquisitions of real estate, through the close of our Offerings on September 30, 2015, was proceeds we received from our Offerings. While our Offerings closed on September 30, 2015, we continue to provide existing stockholders the opportunity to designate their cash distributions for reinvestment through our Reinvestment Plan. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from collateralized or uncollateralized financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of properties, other assets and undistributed operating cash flows. If necessary, we may use financings or other sources of capital in the event of unforeseen significant capital expenditures. As of December 31, 2016, we have approximately $11.1 million of available proceeds remaining under our senior unsecured revolving line of credit ( Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nWe substantially completed our acquisition phase in 2016 and expect future acquisition activity to be limited. Prior to completion of our acquisition phase, our principal demand for funds has been for acquisitions, the payment of debt service on our outstanding indebtedness and the payment of distributions. Generally, we expect to meet short-term working capital needs from our cash flows from operations and proceeds from our Reinvestment Plan.\nWe may also be negatively impacted by rising interest rates on any unhedged variable rate debt or the timing of when we seek to refinance existing debt. In addition, we will continue to evaluate the need for additional interest rate protection in the form of interest rate swaps or caps on unhedged variable rate debt.\nSources of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nCommon Stock Offerings\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from our Offerings of approximately $551.9 million and $554.6 million respectively.\nReinvestment Plan\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we received proceeds from our Reinvestment Plan of approximately $42.6 million, $36.8 million and $17.7 million respectively.\nBorrowings\nWe have borrowed and intend to continue borrowing money to fund ongoing real estate development and other enhancements to our portfolio, as well as to cover periodic shortfalls between distributions paid and cash flows from operating activities. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we borrowed proceeds of approximately $142.5 million, $549.2 million and $510.3 million, respectively, net of repayments on the Revolving Credit Facility of $120.3 million, $321.4 million and $259.3 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts were primarily used to fund real estate under development and acquire additional properties. While we have substantially completed our acquisition phase, we may evaluate additional acquisition opportunities and borrow additional money to fund such acquisitions.\nIn December 2014, we entered into a $230 million Revolving Credit Facility and a $175 million senior unsecured term loan facility ( Term Loan Facility\u201d and, collectively, Credit Facilities\u201d). Pursuant to the associated credit agreement, we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity to $700 million under the accordion feature of the Credit Facilities. To date, we have exercised this accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity to $445 million. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility has an initial term through December 2017 plus two 12-month extension options through which we can extend the term through December 2019; whereas the Term Loan Facility has an initial term through February 2019 plus one 12-month extension option through which we can extend the term through February 2020. We expect to exercise one of our two 12-month extension options on the Revolving Credit Facility to extend the term through December 2018.\nIn November 2015, we entered into a $250 million senior unsecured term loan facility ( Second Term Loan Facility\u201d). The Second Term Loan Facility has an initial term through November 2020 and we have the ability to increase our borrowing capacity to $350M under its accordion feature. To date, we have exercised this accordion feature and increased our borrowing capacity to $275 million.\nIn March 2017, we obtained approximately $28 million of additional borrowings related to Wellmore of Tega Cay, which was an unencumbered asset as of December 31, 2016. The loan has an initial term of 36 months plus one 12-month extension option, an interest rate equal to 30-day LIBOR plus 2.65% per annum and a 12-month interest only period followed by a 30-year amortization for the remaining term of the loan.\nWe may borrow money to pay distributions to stockholders, for working capital and for other corporate purposes. See Uses of Liquidity and Capital Resources - Distributions\u201d below for additional information related to the payment of distributions with Other Sources for GAAP purposes. In many cases, we have pledged our assets in connection with our borrowings and intend to encumber assets in connection with additional borrowings. The aggregate amount of long-term financing is not expected to exceed 60% of our total assets on an annual basis. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had an aggregate debt leverage ratio of approximately 55.8% and 52.6%, respectively, of the aggregate carrying value of our assets.\nThe following table provides details of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgages payable and other notes payable:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Fixed rate debt\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 382,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 391,639\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Variable rate debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 561,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 449,017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Mortgages and other notes payable (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 944,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 840,656\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Premium (discount), net (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (67)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (221)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loan costs, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,213)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,610)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total mortgages and other notes payable, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 936,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 831,825\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facilities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Revolving Credit Facility (4) (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 194,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 225,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> First Term Loan Facility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 175,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Second Term Loan Facility (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 275,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 260,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Loan costs, net related to Term Loan Facilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,874)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,716)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total credit facilities, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 641,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 656,284\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,578,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,488,109\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_____________\nFOOTNOTES:\n (1) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts of approximately $521.5 million and $480.7 million, respectively, which were settling on a monthly basis. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 12. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d for additional information. \n (2) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our mortgages and other notes payable are collateralized by 75 and 65 properties, respectively, with total carrying values of approximately $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. \n (3) Premium (discount), net is reflective of us recording mortgage note payables assumed at fair value on the respective acquisition date. \n (4) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility of approximately $11.1 million and $20.0 million, respectively, based on the value of the properties in the unencumbered pool of assets supporting the loan. \n (5) As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we entered into interest rate caps with notional amounts of approximately $410.0 million and $260.0 million, respectively. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 12. Derivative Financial Instruments\u201d for additional information. \nGenerally, the loan agreements for our mortgage loans contain customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, representations, warranties and borrowing conditions, as set forth in the loan agreements. The loan agreements also contain customary events of default and remedies for the lenders. The borrowers are normally direct or indirect subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership.\nThe Credit Facilities contain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants which are customary for loans of this type, including (but not limited to): (i) maximum leverage, (ii) minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, (iii) minimum consolidated net worth, (iv) restrictions on payments of cash distributions except if required by REIT requirements, (v) maximum secured indebtedness, (vi) maximum secured recourse debt, (vii) minimum unsecured interest coverage and (viii) limitations on certain types of investments and with respect to the pool of properties supporting borrowings under the Credit Facilities, minimum debt service coverage ratio, minimum weighted average occupancy, and remaining lease terms, as well as property type, MSA, operator, and asset value concentration limits. The limitations on distributions include a limitation on the extent of allowable distributions, which are not to exceed the greater of 95% of adjusted FFO (as defined per the Credit Facilities) and the minimum amount of distributions required to maintain our REIT status. We do not expect this limitation to be a limiting factor for our board of directors when determining distribution levels now or in the future. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants and ratios.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d - Note 10. Indebtedness\u201d for additional information on our borrowings, including a schedule of future principal payments and maturity dates. In addition,"}
