MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nPerformance Overview\nNet income was $68,014 for 2015 compared to $59,582 for 2014 and $33,487 for 2013. The fluctuation in net income since 2013 was influenced by a number of factors:\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Effective July 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition by merger with Heritage Financial Group, Inc. ( Heritage\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Albany, Georgia, in a transaction valued at $295,380. The Company issued approximately 8.6 million shares of common stock and paid $5,915 to Heritage stock option holders for 100% of the voting equity interest in Heritage. On July 1, 2015, Heritage operated 48 banking, mortgage and investment offices in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, which are still being finalized by the Company and are subject to change, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2,014,882, including loans both held for sale and held for investment with a fair value of $1,460,242, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,719,502, including deposits with a fair value of $1,375,354. The Company recorded approximately $183,438 in intangible assets which consist of goodwill of $171,182 and a core deposit intangible of $12,256.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>On September 1, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of First M&F Corporation ( First M&F\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Kosciusko, Mississippi, which operated 35 full-service banking offices and eight insurance offices throughout Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama. The Company issued approximately 6.2 million shares of its common stock for 100% of the voting equity interests in First M&F in a transaction valued at $156,845. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $1,516,603 including loans with a fair value of $899,236, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,361,079, including deposits with a fair value of $1,325,872. At the acquisition date, approximately $90,127 of goodwill and $25,032 of core deposit intangible assets were recorded.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net interest income increased 19.20% to $241,358 for 2015 as compared to $202,482 for 2014; net interest income was $157,133 for 2013. Interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 15.88% to $270,278 for 2015 from $233,246 for 2014. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was due primarily to the increase in average earnings assets from the acquisition of Heritage. Interest expense decreased 9.45% to $21,665 for 2015 compared to $23,927 for 2014; interest expense was $23,471 for 2013.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.10% in 2015 compared to 0.29% in 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.22% in 2013. The provision for loan losses was $4,750 for 2015 compared to $6,167 for 2014 and $10,350 for 2013.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Noninterest income was $108,270 for 2015 compared to $80,509 for 2014 and $71,891 for 2013. The growth in noninterest income in 2015 when compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the Heritage acquisition, the addition of the Heritage mortgage division and growth in our mortgage division. The Company also experienced an increase in income from the Insurance and Wealth Management divisions after the acquisition of First M&F which was completed late in the third quarter of 2013. Our goal is to continue developing products that generate noninterest income in order to diversify our revenue streams.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Noninterest expenses were $245,114 for 2015 compared to $190,937 for 2014 and $172,928 for 2013. The increase in noninterest expense during the three year period is primarily attributable to the integration of operating expenses of the acquired Heritage and First M&F operations. The Company recorded merger expenses in connection with these acquisitions of $11,614, $694, and $6,027 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Loans, net of unearned income, were $5,413,462 at December 31, 2015 compared to $3,987,874 in 2014 and $3,881,018 in 2013. Excluding the acquired loans of $1,583,028 at December 31, 2015, the portfolio increased in size by $562,948 from December 31, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Deposits totaled $6,218,602 at December 31, 2015 compared to $4,838,418 at December 31, 2014 and $4,841,912 at December 31, 2013. The growth in deposits from 2015 to 2014 was attributable to the acquisition of Heritage, which added $1,266,921 in deposits at December 31, 2014. Management's strategy to build and maintain a stable source of funding through core deposits, driven by noninterest-bearing deposits, has allowed for certain higher costing time deposits to mature or expire without renewal, some of which have been replaced with noninterest-bearing deposits and other lower costing deposits.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA historical look at key performance indicators is presented below.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS Growth\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.09\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Assets\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Shareholders' Equity\n</td> <td>7.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts. Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions used and considers other factors which could impact these estimates. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards, are discussed in further detail in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following discussion presents some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies\u201d ( ASC 450\u201d). Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310, Receivables\u201d ( ASC 310\u201d). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under ASC 310 and the related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment. Additionally, the estimate of the allowance required to absorb credit losses in the entire portfolio may change due to shifts in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and in prevailing economic conditions, as evidenced by changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates and energy costs. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For a discussion of other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nCertain loans acquired in acquisitions or mergers are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d). ASC 310-30 prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in which the acquirer concludes that it will not collect the contractual amount. As a result, these loans are carried at values which represent management's estimate of the future cash flows of these loans. Increases in expected cash flows to be collected from the contractual cash flows are required to be recognized as an adjustment of the loan's yield over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are required to be recognized as an impairment. A more detailed discussion of loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, which were acquired in connection with our mergers with Heritage in 2015, First M&F in 2013, Capital Bancorp, Inc. in 2007 and with Heritage Financial Holding Corporation in 2005 and our acquisitions of Crescent and American Trust in FDIC-assisted transactions in 2010 and 2011, respectively, is set forth below under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and in Note D, Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther-Than-Temporary-Impairment on Investment Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate our investment portfolio for other-than-temporary-impairment ( OTTI\u201d) in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d An investment security is considered impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost basis. Impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary if the Company intends to sell the investment security or if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security before the Company is required to sell the security or the security's maturity. When impairment of an equity security is considered to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in earnings. When impairment of a debt security is considered to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value. The amount of OTTI recorded as a loss in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the debt security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell the debt security or more\nlikely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI is separated into the amount representing credit loss and the amount related to all other market factors. The amount related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount related to other market factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nThe amount of OTTI recorded in earnings as a credit loss is dependent upon management's estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from the investment security. The difference between the expected cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the security is considered to be credit loss. The remaining difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the security is considered to be related to all other market factors. Our estimate of discounted future cash flows incorporates a number of assumptions based on both qualitative and quantitative factors. Performance indicators of the security's underlying assets, including credit ratings and current and projected default and deferral rates, as well as the credit quality and capital ratios of the issuing institutions are considered in the analysis. Changes in these assumptions could impact the amount of OTTI recognized as a credit loss in earnings. For additional information regarding the evaluation of our securities portfolio for OTTI, please refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d and Note C, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and customer relationship intangibles. Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements of the business acquired. We review the goodwill of each of our reporting units (that is, our reportable segments for financial accounting purposes) for impairment on an annual basis, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use both the market and discounted cash flow approaches. The market approach averages the values derived by applying a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions, to the book value, tangible book value, loan and/or deposit balances and the last twelve months adjusted and unadjusted net income. The discounted cash flow approach requires assumptions about short and long-term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. Long-term net cash flow forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations.\nWe assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by reference to our market capitalization; however, due to the significant volatility in the equity markets with respect to the financial institution sector since 2008, we also consulted supplemental information based on observable market multiples, adjusting to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions. In some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's equity exceeds its estimated fair value, we then calculate the fair value of the reporting unit's implied goodwill. Implied goodwill is the excess fair value of a reporting unit (as determined using the above-described methodology) over the fair value of its net assets and is calculated by determining the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized intangible assets, on an individual basis. This calculation is performed in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.\nOther identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent any other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded as a noninterest expense to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, when or if they occur, could be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.\nBenefit Plans and Stock Based Compensation\nOur independent actuary firm prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d ( ASC 715\u201d). The discount rate utilized in the December 31, 2015 valuation was 4.00%, compared to 4.83% in 2014. Actual plan assets as of December 31, 2015 were used in the calculation and the expected long-term return on plan assets assumed for this valuation was 8.00%. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the benefit plan obligation and the funded status of the plan which in turn may impact shareholders' equity through an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income and future pension expense. The pension plan covered under ASC 715 was frozen as of December 31, 1996.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d We utilize the Black-Scholes model for determining fair value of our options. Determining the fair value of, and ultimately the expense we recognize related to, our stock options requires us to make assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected stock price volatility, estimated forfeitures and the expected life of the option. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock-based compensation and the related expense to be recognized. Due to the low historical forfeiture rate, the Company did not estimate any forfeitures in determining the fair value of options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Changes in this assumption in the future could result in lower expenses related to the Company's stock options. For a description of our assumptions utilized in calculating the fair value of our share-based payments, please refer to Note N, Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBusiness Combinations, Accounting for Acquired Loans and Related Assets\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value measurements of acquired loans are based on estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nOver the life of the acquired loans, the Company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics. The Company evaluates, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, the present value of the acquired loans determined using the effective interest rates. If the cash flows expected to be collected have decreased, the Company recognizes a provision for loan loss in its consolidated statement of income; for any increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the loan's or pool's remaining life.\nBecause the FDIC will reimburse the Company for losses related to a portion of the loans acquired in the Crescent, American Trust, Citizens Bank of Effingham and First Southern National Bank transactions (see Loans\u201d below), an indemnification asset is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The indemnification asset is recognized at the same time as the indemnified loans and measured on the same basis, subject to collectability or contractual limitations. The fair value of the indemnification asset reflects the reimbursements expected to be received from the FDIC, using an appropriate discount rate, which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties.\nThe indemnification asset is measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the indemnification asset also follow that model. Decreases in the future cash flows expected to be collected on the loans immediately increase the fair value of the indemnification asset. Increases in the future cash flows expected to be collected on the loans decrease the fair value of the indemnification asset, with such decrease being accreted into interest income over (1) the same period or (2) the life of the fair value of the indemnification asset, whichever is shorter. Loss assumptions used in the basis of the indemnified loans are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the indemnification asset. Fair value accounting incorporates into the fair value of the indemnification asset an element of the time value of money, which is accreted back into income over the life of the shared loss agreements.\nUpon the determination of an incurred loss the indemnification asset will be reduced by the amount owed by the FDIC. A corresponding receivable is recorded on the balance sheet until cash is received from the FDIC.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nThe Company recognizes as assets the right to service certain mortgage loans for others, known as mortgage servicing rights. The mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income. External valuations of the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights are obtained monthly and determined using various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs mortgage interest rates and other factors. These assumptions can, and generally will, change as market condition and interest rates change resulting in fluctuations of the fair value. The Company does not currently hedge the mortgage servicing right asset. At December 31, 2015, the Company's mortgage servicing asset was valued at $29,642. For additional information regarding our mortgage servicing rights, please refer to Note H - Mortgage Servicing Rights,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of a loan obligation. Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair market value based on appraised value less selling costs, estimated as of the date acquired, with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses.\nReductions in the carrying value subsequent to acquisition are charged to earnings. The fair value of other real estate owned is derived primarily from independent appraisers. Our internal policies generally require OREO properties to be appraised every 12 months. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility, as experienced during the last few years. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes\nAccrued taxes represent the estimated amount payable to or receivable from taxing jurisdictions, either currently or in the future, and are reported, on a net basis, as a component of Other assets\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our income tax expense is complex and requires the use of many estimates and judgments in its determination.\nManagement's determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax assets.\nFor certain business plans enacted by the Company, management bases the estimates of related tax liabilities on its belief that future events will validate management's current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of tax-related exposures. As part of this process, management consults with its outside advisers to assess the relative merits and risks of our proposed tax treatment of such business plans. Although we have received from these outside advisers opinions that our proposed tax treatment should prevail, the examination of our income tax returns, changes in tax law and regulatory guidance may impact the tax treatment of these transactions and resulting provisions for income taxes.\nWe believe that we employ appropriate methods for these calculations and that the results of such calculations closely approximate the actual cost. We review the calculated results for reasonableness and compare those calculations to prior period costs. We also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax accounting, please refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTotal assets were $7,926,496 at December 31, 2015 compared to $5,805,129 at December 31, 2014 and $5,746,270 at December 31, 2013. The acquisition of Heritage increased total assets $2,014,882 at July 1, 2015.\nInvestments\nThe securities portfolio is used to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs and to supply securities to be used in collateralizing certain deposits and other types of borrowings.

The acquisition of Heritage added $177,849 in investment securities. During 2015, we purchased $216,141 in investment\nsecurities. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), in the aggregate, comprised 33.36% of the purchases. CMOs are included in the Mortgage-backed securities\u201d line item in the above table. The mortgage-backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are primarily issued by government sponsored entities. U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities accounted for 46.73% and 19.91%, respectively, of total securities purchased in 2015. There were $8,348 of securities sold during 2015 resulting in a net gain of $96. Proceeds from maturities, calls and sales of securities during 2015 totaled $265,556.\nThe balance of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 increased $70,418 to $983,747 compared to $913,329 at December 31, 2013. During 2014, we purchased $280,164 in investment securities. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, in the aggregate, comprised 44.26% of the purchases. U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities accounted for 41.40% and 14.24%, respectively, of total securities purchased in 2014. The carrying value of securities sold during 2014 totaled $724 resulting in a net gain of $375. Proceeds from maturities, calls and sales of securities during 2014 totaled $217,417.\nAt December 31, 2015 , unrealized losses of $9,545 were recorded on available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of $309,549. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, unrealized losses of $10,466 and $20,041, respectively, were recorded on investment securities with a carrying value of $203,467 and $279,165, respectively. The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company has experienced an overall improvement in the fair value of its investment portfolio and is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective issuers as scheduled. As such, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nThe Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities. This portfolio had a cost basis of $24,770 and $26,400 and a fair value of $19,469 and $19,756 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The investment in pooled trust preferred securities consists of three securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over 250 financial institutions. Management's determination of the fair value of each of its holdings is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing financial institutions and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the cash flow for our tranches is negatively impacted. The Company's quarterly evaluation of these investments for other-than-temporary-impairment resulted in no additional write-downs during 2015, 2014 or 2013. Furthermore, the Company's analysis of the pooled trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2015 supported a return to accrual status for one of the three securities (XXVI). During the second quarter of 2014, the Company's analysis supported a return to accrual status for one of the other securities (XXIII). An observed history of principal and interest payments combined with improved qualitative and quantitative factors described above justified the accrual of interest on these securities. However, the remaining security (XXIV) is still in payment in kind\u201d status where interest payments are not expected until a future date and therefore, the qualitative and quantitative factors described above do not justify a return to accrual status at this time. As a result, pooled trust preferred security XXIV remains classified as nonaccruing asset at December 31, 2015, and investment interest is recorded on the cash-basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status. For more information about the Company's trust preferred securities, see Note C, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nLoans\nLoans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, are the Company's most significant earning asset, comprising 68.30%, 68.70% and 67.54% of total assets at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

At December 31, 2015, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than loans disclosed in the table above.\nTotal loans at December 31, 2015 were $5,413,462, an increase of $1,425,588 from $3,987,874 at December 31, 2014. Total loans were $3,881,018 at December 31, 2013. Loans increased $1,122,197 in 2015 as a result of our completion of the Heritage acquisition on July 1, 2015. Loans covered under loss-share agreements with the FDIC (referred to as covered loans\u201d) were $93,142 at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $49,899, or 34.88%, compared to $143,041 at December 31, 2014. The Company's acquisition of Heritage added two FDIC loss-share agreements, increasing the Company's loans covered under loss sharing agreement by $40,751 at December 31, 2015. Loans covered under loss-share agreements with the FDIC were $181,674 at December 31, 2013. For covered loans, the FDIC will reimburse the Bank 80% of the losses incurred on these loans. The Bank has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the FDIC for 80% of eligible recoveries with respect to these loans. Management intends to continue the Company's aggressive efforts to bring those covered loans that are commercial in nature to resolution and thus the balance of covered loans is expected to continue to decline. The loss-share agreements applicable to this portfolio provide reimbursement for qualifying losses on single-family residential loans for ten years, which ends on July 31, 2020 for loans acquired from Crescent Bank & Trust Company ( Crescent\u201d), February 28, 2021 for loans acquired from American Trust Bank ( American Trust\u201d), February 28, 2021 for loans acquired from Citizens Bank of Effingham ( Citizens\u201d) and August 31, 2021 for loans acquired from First Southern National Bank ( First Southern\u201d). For qualifying losses on commercial loans, reimbursement runs for five years, which ended July 25, 2015 for Crescent loans and ends February 5, 2016 for American Trust loans, February 18, 2016 for Citizens loans and August 19, 2016 for First Southern loans. As a result of the expiration of the loss-share agreement on Crescent commercial loans, the Company reclassified loans totaling $62,582 from acquired covered loans to acquired non-covered loans, $46,000 of which was still remaining at December 31, 2015. This reclassification explains most of the decrease in the covered loans balance, which decrease was offset by the increase in covered loans resulting from the Heritage acquisition.\nLoans not covered under loss-share agreements with the FDIC at December 31, 2015 were $5,320,320, compared to $3,844,833 at December 31, 2014 and $3,699,344 at December 31, 2013. Loans acquired and not covered under loss sharing agreements totaled $1,489,886 at December 31, 2015 compared to $577,347 at December 31, 2014 and $813,543 at December 31, 2013. Excluding the loans acquired from Heritage, First M&F or in FDIC-assisted transactions (whether or not covered by loss-share agreements) (collectively referred to as acquired loans\u201d), loans increased $562,948 during 2015 to $3,830,434 from $3,267,486 at December 31, 2014. The Company experienced loan growth across all categories of loans with loans from our new commercial business lines, which consist of asset-based lending, equipment leasing and healthcare banking groups, contributing $53,663 of the total increase in loans from December 31, 2014.\nExcluding acquired loans, loans increased $381,685 during 2014 to $3,267,486 from $2,885,801 at December 31, 2013. The increase in non-acquired loans was attributable to growth in owner and non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, as well as loan production generated by de novo expansion from 2011 to 2013.\nLooking at the change in loans geographically, non-acquired loans in our Mississippi markets increased by $204,516 while non-acquired loans in our Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida markets increased by $68,127, $134,756, $138,627, and $25,547, respectively, when compared to December 31, 2014 (the Company entered its Florida markets on July 1, 2015 as a result of the Heritage acquisition).\nThe following tables provide a breakdown of covered loans and loans not covered under loss-share agreements as of the dates presented:\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td> Not Acquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquired and Covered Under Loss Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Acquired and Non-covered\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nLoans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial, agricultural\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>636,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing\n</td> <td>34,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate -

The increase in mortgage loans held for sale is attributable to the addition of the Heritage mortgage operations and increased production in Renasant's existing mortgage operations coupled with the Company's election to carry these loans on the balance sheet for a longer period of time to collect additional interest payments while the market for the sale of these loans\ndid not decline such that our gains from the eventual sales of these loans would be negatively impacted. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled $1,483,937 in 2015, $547,402 in 2014 and $619,526 in 2013. The increase in mortgage loan originations from 2014 is due to an increase in mortgage activity driven by historically low mortgage rates and the addition of Heritage's mortgage operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, originations of mortgage loans from the Company's existing mortgage operations were $824,550 while originations from Heritage's mortgage operations during the six months after the acquisition date were $659,387.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies, and the Company is obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within thirty days after the loan is funded; however, in recent quarters, the Company has elected to hold these loans longer than thirty days to collect additional interest payments. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market.\nDeposits\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-Bearing Deposits to Total Deposits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>20.56%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.01%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.68%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company relies on deposits as its major source of funds. Total deposits were $6,218,602, $4,838,418 and $4,841,912 at December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $1,278,337, $919,872 and $856,020 at December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $4,940,265, $3,918,546 and $3,985,892 at December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The acquisition of Heritage increased total deposits by $1,375,354 at the acquisition date. This consisted of noninterest-bearing deposits of $279,123 and interest-bearing deposits of $1,096,231. Management continues to focus on growing and maintaining a stable source of funding, specifically core deposits, and allowing more costly deposits, including certain time deposits, to mature. The source of funds that we select depends on the terms and how those terms assist us in mitigating interest rate risk, maintaining our liquidity position and managing our net interest margin. Accordingly, funds are only acquired when needed and at a rate that is prudent under the circumstances.\nPublic fund deposits are those of counties, municipalities, or other political subdivisions and may be readily obtained based on the Company's pricing bid in comparison with competitors. Since public fund deposits are obtained through a bid process, these deposit balances may fluctuate as competitive and market forces change. The Company has focused on growing stable sources of deposits which has resulted in the Company relying less on public fund deposits. However, the Company continues to participate in the bidding process for public fund deposits when it is reasonable under the circumstances. Our public fund transaction accounts are principally obtained from municipalities including school boards and utilities. Public fund deposits at December 31, 2015 were $775,385 compared to $654,423 at December 31, 2014 and $420,539 at December 31, 2013.\nLooking at the change in deposits geographically and excluding the deposits from the Heritage acquisition, deposits in our Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama markets increased by $59,686, $21,746 and $50,905, respectively, from December 31, 2014 while deposits in our Georgia markets decreased by $32,542 from December 31, 2014.\nBorrowed Funds\nTotal borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, overnight borrowings, advances from the FHLB and junior subordinated debentures and are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either short-term borrowings or long-term debt. Short-term borrowings have original maturities less than one year and typically include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, overnight borrowings and FHLB advances. There was $422,279 of short-term borrowings on the balance sheet at December 31, 2015, consisting of security repurchase agreements of $22,279 and overnight borrowings from the FHLB of $400,000 compared to security repurchase agreements of $6,103 and overnight borrowings from the FHLB of $26,300 at December 31, 2014. The increase in short-term borrowings from the prior year-end is attributable to the increased production in Renasant's existing mortgage operations as well as the addition of Heritage's mortgage operations as overnight borrowings are often used to fund mortgage loans held for sale.\nAt December 31, 2015, long-term debt totaled $148,217 compared to $156,422 at December 31, 2014. Funds are borrowed from the FHLB primarily to match-fund against certain loans, negating interest rate exposure when rates rise. Such match-funded loans are typically large, fixed rate commercial or real estate loans with long-term maturities. Long-term FHLB advances were $52,930 and $61,611 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2015, $261 of the total FHLB advances outstanding were scheduled to mature within twelve months or less. The Company had $1,659,779 of availability on unused lines of credit with the FHLB at December 31, 2015 compared to $1,592,550 at December 31, 2014. The cost of our FHLB advances was 4.14%, 4.15% and 4.22% for 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nThe Company owns the outstanding common securities of business trusts that issued corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities to third-party investors. The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their preferred capital securities and common securities (collectively referred to as capital securities\u201d) to buy floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (or by companies that the Company subsequently acquired.) The debentures are the trusts' only assets and interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the capital securities. The Company's junior subordinated debentures totaled $95,095 at December 31, 2015 compared to $94,574 at December 31, 2014 and $94,187 at December 31, 2013. In connection with the acquisition of First M&F on September 1, 2013, the Company assumed $30,928 in fixed/floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures payable to First M&F Statutory Trust I that mature in March 2036. The acquired subordinated debentures require interest to be paid quarterly at a rate of 90-day LIBOR plus 1.33%. The fair value adjustment on the junior subordinated debentures of $12,371 will be amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining life. The debentures owned by First M&F Statutory Trust I are currently redeemable at par.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $68,014 compared to net income of $59,582 for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $33,487 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Basic earnings per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $1.89 as compared to $1.23 for the year ended December 31, 2013. Diluted earnings per share for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $1.88 as compared to $1.22 for the year ended December 31, 2013. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized $11,614 in pre-tax merger expenses compared to $694 and $6,027 recognized in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of our net income, comprising 69.66% of total net revenue in 2015. Total net revenue consists of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income. The primary concerns in managing net interest income are the volume, mix and repricing of assets and liabilities.\nNet interest income increased 19.20% to $241,358 for 2015 compared to $202,482 in 2014 and $157,133 in 2013. On a tax equivalent basis, net interest income increased $39,294 to $248,613 in 2015 as compared to $209,319 and $162,957 in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Interest Margin - Tax Equivalent\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.12%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest margin, the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets, increased to 4.16% during 2015 from 4.12% in 2014 and 3.96% in 2013. Additional interest income recognized in connection with the acceleration of pay downs and payoffs from acquired loans increased our net interest margin by 14 basis points for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to an increase of 17 basis points and 5 basis points in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net interest margin and net interest income are influenced by internal and external factors. Internal factors include balance sheet changes on both volume and mix and pricing decisions. External factors include changes in market interest rates, competition and the shape of the interest rate yield curve.\nInterest income, on a tax equivalent basis, was $270,278 for 2015 compared to $233,246 for 2014, an increase of $37,032. Interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, was $186,428 for 2013. The increase in interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, is due primarily to the acquisitions of Heritage in July 2015 and First M&F in September 2013 offset by a decrease in loan yields which is a result of replacing higher rate maturing loans with new or renewed loans at current market rates which are generally lower due to the current interest rate environment. Excluding the contribution from Heritage, the Company has also experienced a decrease in the average balance of the securities portfolio from 2014 as proceeds from maturities and calls were used to fund loan growth rather than be reinvested in the securities portfolio.\nThe following table presents the percentage of total average earning assets, by type and yield, for 2015, 2014 and 2013:\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans\n</td> <td>80.95\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Securities\n</td> <td>17.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>1.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total earning assets\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015 loan income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $36,564 to $237,408 from $200,844 in 2014. Loan income, on a tax equivalent basis, was $159,587 in 2013. The average balance of loans was $4,836,002 in 2015 compared to $3,941,015 and $3,214,567 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in loan income and the average balance of loans from 2013 to 2015 is primarily due to the acquisitions of Heritage and First M&F as well as increased production in the commercial and secondary mortgage loan markets.\nThe tax equivalent yield on loans was 4.91% for 2015, a 19 basis point decrease from the same period in 2014. The decrease in loan yields was primarily a result of replacing higher rate maturing loans with new or renewed loans at current market rates which are generally lower due to the current interest rate environment. Furthermore, lower levels of accelerated accretion have been recognized in 2015 when compared to 2014 resulting from lower levels of payoffs from the acquired loan portfolio. The tax equivalent yield on loans was 5.10% for 2014 compared to 4.96% in 2013. The increase in loan yields from 2013 to 2014 was primarily a result of accelerated accretion of nonaccretable difference on the acquired loan portfolio due to higher than expected levels of payoffs from the First M&F portfolio, offset partially by replacing higher rate maturing loans with new or renewed loans at current market rates which were generally lower in 2014 due to the prevailing interest rate environment. The accelerated accretion on the acquired loan portfolio increased our loan yield by 18 basis points in 2015 compared to 22 basis points and 6 basis points in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nIn 2015, investment income, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $648 to $32,655 from $32,007 in 2014. Investment income, on a tax equivalent basis, was $26,593 in 2013. The average balance in the investment portfolio in 2015 was $1,063,222 compared to $1,002,449 and $799,955 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The tax equivalent yield on the investment portfolio in 2015 was 3.07% compared to 3.19% and 3.32% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. The contribution from Heritage in 2015 was nearly offset by a reduction in the balance of the securities portfolio. Proceeds from maturities and calls of higher yielding securities were either redeployed to fund loan growth or reinvested in lower earning securities accounting for both the decrease in the average balance of investments, excluding the impact from Heritage and First M&F, and tax equivalent yield thereon when compared to 2014 and 2013. The reinvestment rates on securities were lower due to the generally lower interest rate environment.\nInterest expense was $21,665 in 2015 compared to $23,927 and $23,471 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities in 2015 was $4,798,579 compared to $4,143,304 and $3,455,976 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The contributions to interest-bearing liabilities from the Heritage and First M&F acquisitions were more than offset by a shift in the mix of our deposits from higher costing time deposits to lower costing interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing deposits, and when combined with the declining interest rate environment, resulted in an overall decrease in interest expense since 2013. The Company continues to seek changes in the mix of our interest-bearing liabilities in which we utilize lower costing deposits to replace higher costing liabilities, specifically time deposits. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 0.45% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 0.58% and 0.68% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe following table presents, by type, the Company's funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, and the total cost of each funding source for each of the years presented:\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost of Funds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>19.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>43.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>7.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>23.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td>0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowed funds\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits and borrowed funds\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense on deposits was $13,715, $16,216 and $17,118 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The improvement in the cost of total borrowings from previous years is driven by a higher average balance of overnight borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank which incur a much lower rate of interest. The increase is attributable to the increased production in Renasant's existing mortgage operations as well as the addition of Heritage's mortgage operations as overnight borrowings are often used to fund mortgage loans held for sale. A more detailed discussion of the cost of our funding sources is set forth below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in this item.

Our focus is to develop and enhance our products that generate noninterest income in order to diversify our revenue sources. Noninterest income as a percentage of total net revenues was 30.34%, 27.78% and 30.61% for 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nNoninterest income was $108,270 for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $27,761, or 34.48%, as compared to $80,509 for 2014. The increase in noninterest income and its related components is primarily attributable to the Heritage acquisition, Heritage's mortgage operations and a significant increase in mortgage revenue from the Company's existing mortgage operations due to increased production as a result of continued decreases in interest rates and recent mortgage originator hires. Noninterest income was $71,891 for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nService charges on deposit accounts include maintenance fees on accounts, per item charges, account enhancement charges for additional packaged benefits and overdraft fees. Service charges on deposit accounts were $29,269, $26,756 and $21,559 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Overdraft fees, the largest component of service charges on deposits, were $20,870 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $19,434 and $16,265 for the same period in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nFees and commissions increased to $16,091 in 2015 as compared to $14,231 and $11,675 for the same period in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Fees and commissions include fees related to deposit services, such as ATM fees and interchange fees on debit card transactions, as well as servicing income from non-mortgage loans serviced by the Company. Interchange fees on debit card transactions, the largest component of fees and commissions, were $14,269 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $11,925 and $9,686 for the same period in 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThrough Renasant Insurance, we offer a range of commercial and personal insurance products through major insurance carriers. Income earned on insurance products was $8,423, $8,194 and $4,976 for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The First M&F acquisition was the primary factor contributing to the increase in insurance revenues from 2013 to 2014. Contingency income is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience on our clients' policies during the previous year. Increases and decreases in contingency income are reflective of corresponding increases and decreases in the amount of claims paid by insurance carriers. Contingency income, which is included in Other noninterest income\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was $553, $605 and $256 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe Trust division within the Wealth Management segment operates on a custodial basis which includes administration of benefit plans, as well as accounting and money management for trust accounts. The division manages a number of trust accounts inclusive\nof personal and corporate benefit accounts, self-directed IRAs, and custodial accounts. Fees for managing these accounts are based on changes in market values of the assets under management in the account, with the amount of the fee depending on the type of account. Additionally, the Financial Services division within the Wealth Management segment provides specialized products and services to our customers, which include fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds, and stocks offered through a third party provider. Wealth Management revenue was $9,808 for 2015 compared to $8,545 for 2014 and $7,574 for 2013. The market value of trust assets under management was $2,929,597, $2,646,391 and $2,409,534 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage banking income included in noninterest income at December 31:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of loans, net\n</td> <td>25,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees, net\n</td> <td>10,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMortgage banking income is derived from the origination and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans that the Company has sold but retained the right to service. Mortgage banking income was $35,815 for 2015 compared to $14,862 and $18,835 for 2014 and 2013, respectively. Mortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement with gains and losses realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market. Gains on the sale of mortgage loans held for sale were $25,292, $8,594, and $11,573 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled $1,483,937 in 2015, $547,402 in 2014 and $619,526 in 2013. The increase in mortgage loan originations from 2014 is due to an increase in mortgage activity driven by historically low mortgage rates and the addition of Heritage's mortgage operations. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, originations of mortgage loans from the Company's existing mortgage operations were $824,550 while originations from Heritage's mortgage operations during the six months after the acquisition date were $659,387.\nNoninterest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 include the Company's sale of its pooled trust preferred security XIII in the second quarter of 2015 with a carrying value of $1,117 at the time of sale for net proceeds of $1,213 resulting in a gain of $96. Furthermore, the Company sold certain investments acquired from Heritage shortly after the acquisition date with a carrying value of $7,231 at the time of sale for net proceeds of $7,231, resulting in no gain or loss on the sale. Gains on sales of securities for the twelve months ended 2014 were $375, resulting from the sale of approximately $724 in securities. Gains on sales of securities for 2013 were $54, resulting from the sale of approximately $13,420 in securities.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest Expense to Average Assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.57%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.28%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.65%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $245,114, $190,937 and $172,928 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in noninterest expenses and its related components from 2014 is primarily attributable to the Heritage acquisition, and the increase from 2013 is primarily attributable to the First M&F acquisition. The Company recorded merger expense related to these acquisitions of $11,614, $694 and $6,027 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nSalaries and employee benefits is the largest component of noninterest expenses and represented 59.20%, 60.29% and 57.12% of total noninterest expense at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2015, salaries and employee benefits increased $30,003, or 26.07%, to $145,111 as compared to $115,108 for 2014. The increase in salaries and employee benefits is attributable to the addition of the Heritage operations and higher levels of commissions paid in our mortgage banking division. Salaries and employee benefits increased $16,328 in 2014 from $98,780 recognized in 2013. The increase was primarily due to the addition of the First M&F operations as well as the desire to retain professional personnel required for a growing infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing information security risk and to bolster regulatory compliance areas.\nThe compensation expense recorded in connection with grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock, which is included within salaries and employee benefits, was $3,663, $3,649 and $2,666 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Restricted stock\nawards in all three years were subject to the satisfaction of performance-based conditions attained. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, performance conditions were met and compensation expense was recognized in accordance with performance.\nData processing costs increased $2,646, or 23.21%, to $14,046 in 2015 from $11,400 in 2014. The increase from 2014 was primarily attributable to the Heritage acquisition and the addition of enhancements to our products and services, including mobile banking and small business Internet banking platforms. Data processing costs increased $2,530 in 2014 from $8,870 in 2013. The increase from 2013 was attributable to the addition of the First M&F deposit and loan customer databases, offset by cost savings achieved through efforts to improve the cost structure of loan and deposit processing by renegotiating contracts with data processing service providers.\nNet occupancy and equipment expense in 2015 was $26,987, an increase of $6,735, compared to $20,252 for 2014. In addition to the occupancy and equipment expense of Heritage operations, the increase in occupancy and equipment expense is attributable to the completion of full service banking facilities placed into operation during the fourth quarter of 2014 and an operations annex location placed into operation in the first quarter of 2015. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $3,295 for 2014 compared to $16,957 for 2013. The increase is attributable to occupancy costs associated with the acquisition of First M&F as well as the Company's de novo expansions from 2011 to 2013.\nExpenses related to other real estate owned for 2015 were $3,045, compared to $4,593 in 2014 and $6,966 in 2013. Expenses on other real estate owned for 2015 include write downs of $2,157 of the carrying value to fair value on certain pieces of property held in other real estate owned compared to write downs of $2,434 and $3,270 in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of $21,424 was sold during 2015, resulting in a net gain of $582 compared to other real estate owned with a cost basis of $28,807 sold during 2014 for a net gain of $151. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of $60,241 was sold during 2013, resulting in a net loss of $590.\nProfessional fees include fees for legal and accounting services. Professional fees were $4,384 for 2015 as compared to $4,485 for 2014 and $5,540 for 2013. While the Company experienced a slight decrease in professional fees year over year, professional fees remain elevated in large part due to additional legal, accounting and consulting fees associated with compliance costs of newly enacted as well as existing banking and governmental regulation. Professional fees attributable to legal fees associated with loan workouts and foreclosure proceedings remain at higher levels in correlation with the overall economic downturn and credit deterioration identified in our loan portfolio and the Company's efforts to bring these credits to resolution.\nAdvertising and public relations expense was $6,112 for 2015, an increase of $189 compared to $5,923 for 2014. Advertising and public relations expense increased $293 for 2014 compared to $5,630 for 2013. These year-over-year increases are attributable to advertising and marketing costs associated with the Company's expansion into new markets.\nAmortization of intangible assets totaled $6,069 for 2015 compared to $5,606 for 2014 and $2,869 for 2013. This amortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets which are being amortized over the useful lives as determined at acquisition. These finite-lived intangible assets have remaining estimated useful lives ranging from 1.5 years to 10.5 years. The increase in amortization expense in 2015 is attributable to the amortization of the core deposit intangible recognized in connection with the Heritage acquisition, and the increase in 2014 is attributable to amortization of the core deposit intangible recognized in connection with the First M&F acquisition.\nCommunication expenses are those expenses incurred for communication to clients and between employees. Communication expenses were $7,278 for 2015 as compared to $5,949 for 2014 and $4,777 for 2013. In addition to the contribution from the Heritage and First M&F acquisitions, the Company has incurred expenses to increase the bandwidth of data lines throughout our footprint, accounting for the increase in expense during the three year period ended December 31, 2015.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>68.68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.88%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73.63%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. The Company calculates this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and noninterest income. Merger expenses contributed approximately 325 basis points to the efficiency ratio for 2015 compared to 24 basis points and 257 basis points in 2014 and 2013, respectively. We remain committed to aggressively managing our costs within the framework of our business model. We expect the efficiency ratio (excluding the impact of merger expenses) to continue to improve from levels reported in 2014 and 2013 from revenue growth while at the same time controlling noninterest expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $31,750, $26,305 and $12,259, respectively. The effective tax rates for those years were 31.83%, 30.63% and 26.80%, respectively. The increased effective tax rate for 2015 as compared to 2014 and 2013 is the result of the Company experiencing improvements in its financial results throughout 2013, 2014 and into 2015, including the contribution from Heritage and First M&F, resulting in higher levels of taxable income.\nRisk Management\nThe management of risk is an on-going process. Primary risks that are associated with the Company include credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Credit and interest rate risk are discussed below, while liquidity risk is discussed in the next subsection under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\nInherent in any lending activity is credit risk, that is, the risk of loss should a borrower default. Credit risk is monitored and managed on an ongoing basis by a credit administration department, senior loan committee, a loss management committee and the Board of Directors loan committee. Credit quality, adherence to policies and loss mitigation are major concerns of credit administration and these committees. The Company's central appraisal review department reviews and approves third-party appraisals obtained by the Company on real estate collateral and monitors loan maturities to ensure updated appraisals are obtained. This department is managed by a State Certified General Real Estate Appraiser and employs an additional State Certified General Real Estate appraiser, Appraisal Intern Appraiser and four evaluators.\nWe have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function. Adherence to these policies and procedures is monitored by management and the Board of Directors. A number of committees and an underwriting staff oversee the lending operations of the Company. These include in-house loan and loss management committees and the Board of Directors loan committee and problem loan review committee. In addition, we maintain a loan review staff to independently monitor loan quality and lending practices. Loan review personnel monitor and, if necessary, adjust the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination, focusing its review on commercial and real estate loans rather than consumer and consumer mortgage loans.\nIn compliance with loan policy, the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience. In addition, each lending officer's prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits. Before funds are advanced on consumer and commercial loans below certain dollar thresholds, loans are reviewed and scored using centralized underwriting methodologies. Loan quality or risk-rating\u201d grades are assigned based upon certain factors, which include the scoring of the loans. This information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality. Loan requests of amounts greater than an officer's lending limits are reviewed by senior credit officers, in-house loan committees or the Board of Directors.\nFor commercial and commercial real estate secured loans, risk-rating grades are assigned by lending, credit administration or loan review personnel, based on an analysis of the financial and collateral strength and other credit attributes underlying each loan. Loan grades range from 1 to 9, with 1 being loans with the least credit risk. Allowance factors established by management are applied to the total balance of loans in each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance factors are established based on historical loss ratios experienced by the Company for these loan types, as well as the credit quality criteria underlying each grade, adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios. In making these adjustments to the allowance factors, management takes into consideration factors which it believes are causing, or are likely in the future to cause, losses within our loan portfolio but which may not be fully reflected in our historical loss ratios. For portfolio balances of consumer, consumer mortgage and certain other similar loan types, allowance factors are determined based on historical loss ratios by portfolio for the preceding eight quarters and may be adjusted by other qualitative criteria.\nThe loss management committee and the Board of Directors problem loan review committee monitor loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded and placed on the Company's internal watch list due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor; the committees then adjust loan grades accordingly. This information is used to assist management in monitoring credit quality. In addition, the Company's portfolio management committee monitors and identifies risks within the Company's loan portfolio by focusing its efforts on reviewing and analyzing loans which are not on the Company's internal watch list. The portfolio management committee monitors loans in portfolios or regions that management believes could be stressed or experiencing credit deterioration.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for problem loans of $500 or greater by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For real estate collateral, the fair market value of the collateral is based upon a recent appraisal\nby a qualified and licensed appraiser of the underlying collateral. When the ultimate collectability of a loan's principal is in doubt, wholly or partially, the loan is placed on nonaccrual.\nAfter all collection efforts have failed, collateral securing loans may be repossessed and sold or, for loans secured by real estate, foreclosure proceedings are initiated. The collateral is sold at public auction for fair market value (based upon recent appraisals described in the above paragraph), with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price. The purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance. If the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds, the deficient balance is sent to the Board of Directors' loan committee for charge-off approval. These charge-offs reduce the allowance for loan losses.\nThe Company experienced improved credit quality measures and the lowest levels of charge-offs since the 2008-2009 recession due in part to the pace of the economic recovery, declining unemployment levels, improved labor participation rate, improved performance of the housing market, and the Company's continued efforts to bring problem credits to resolution. The Company's practice is to charge off estimated losses as soon as such loss is identified and reasonably quantified. Net charge-offs for 2015 were $4,602, or 0.10% as a percentage of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $11,543, or 0.29%, for 2014 and $7,032, or 0.22%, for 2013.\nThe allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under ASC 450. Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310. The balance of these loans and their related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. Other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments, the unemployment rate in our markets, loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established after input from management, loan review and the loss management committee. An evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is calculated quarterly based on the types of loans, an analysis of credit losses and risk in the portfolio, economic conditions and trends within each of these factors. In addition, on a regular basis, management and the Board of Directors review loan ratios. These ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans. Also, management reviews past due ratios by officer, community bank and the Company as a whole. The allowance for loan losses was $42,437, $42,289 and $47,665 at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Loan Losses to Average Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.10%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of management, is necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to meet the inherent risks of losses in our loan portfolio. Factors considered by management in determining the amount of the provision for loan losses include the internal risk rating of individual credits, historical and current trends in net charge-offs, trends in nonperforming loans, trends in past due loans, trends in the market values of underlying collateral securing loans and the current economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. The provision for purchased loans is calculated when there is evidence the loan has deteriorated from performance expectations established in conjunction with the determination of Day 1 Fair Values (the outstanding customer balance of a purchased loan less any credit and/or yield discount applied against the purchased loan) or since our most recent review of such portfolio's performance. Purchased loans either (1) exceeded the performance expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values, resulting in a reversal of any previous provision for such loans or (2) deteriorated from the performance expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values, resulting in partial or full charge-offs of the carrying value of such purchased loans. If the purchased loan continues to exceed expectations subsequent to the reversal of previously established provision, then an adjustment to accretable yield is warranted, which has a positive impact on interest income.\nThe Company has recorded lower levels of provision for loan losses since 2011 in response to improved overall economic conditions discussed previously and improved credit quality conditions. Since 2011, the Company has experienced lower levels of classified loans and nonperforming loans, which is illustrated in the nonperforming loan tables provided later in this section. In addition, the Company has experienced improved credit quality measures. These factors have justified a decrease in the provision for loan losses for 2015 as compared to 2014 and 2013. The provision for loan losses was $4,750, $6,167 and $10,350 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specific reserves for impaired loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allocated reserves for remaining portfolio\n</td> <td>33,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquired with deteriorated credit quality\n</td> <td>1,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA majority of the loans acquired in the Company's FDIC-assisted acquisitions (including the covered loans acquired as part of the Heritage acquisition) and certain loans acquired and not covered under the Company's FDIC loss-share agreements are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d), and are carried at values which, in management's opinion, reflect the estimated future cash flows, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each respective loan at the date of acquisition. The fair value of loans accounted for in accordance with ASC 310-30 was $336,165 and $344,425 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company continually monitors these loans as part of our normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated future cash flows; to the extent future cash flows deteriorate below initial projections, the Company may be required to reserve for these loans in the allowance for loan losses through future provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense attributable to loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 totaled $1,706, $1,725 and $644 during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which includes $62, $722 and $509 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, that was attributable to loans covered by loss-share agreements with the FDIC.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category at December 31 for each of the years presented.\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial, agricultural\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate -

Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually 90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. Management, the loss management committee and our loan review staff closely monitor loans that are considered to be nonperforming.\nDebt securities may be transferred to nonaccrual status where the recognition of investment interest is discontinued. A number of qualitative factors, including but not limited to the financial condition of the underlying issuer and current and projected deferrals or defaults, are considered by management in the determination of whether a debt security should be transferred to nonaccrual status. The interest on these nonaccrual investment securities is accounted for on the cash-basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Nonaccruing securities available-for-sale consist of one of the Company's three investments in pooled trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions, which are discussed earlier in this section under the heading Investments\u201d.\nThe following table provides details of the Company's nonperforming assets that are not acquired and not covered by FDIC loss-share agreements ( Not Acquired\u201d), nonperforming assets that have been acquired and are covered by loss-share agreements with the FDIC ( Acquired Covered Assets\u201d), and nonperforming assets acquired and not covered

loss-share agreements with the FDIC, the Company believes that excluding the covered assets from its asset quality measures provides a more meaningful presentation of the Company's asset quality. The asset quality measures surrounding the Company's nonperforming assets discussed in the remainder of this section exclude covered assets relating to the Company's FDIC-assisted acquisitions.\nRestructured Loans\nAnother category of assets which contribute to our credit risk is restructured loans. Restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower's financial condition and are performing in accordance with the new terms. Such concessions may include reduction in interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments. In evaluating whether to restructure a loan, management analyzes the long-term financial condition of the borrower, including guarantor and collateral support, to determine whether the proposed concessions will increase the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest. Restructured loans that are not performing in accordance with their restructured terms that are either contractually 90 days past due or placed on nonaccrual status are reported as nonperforming loans.\nThe following table shows the principal amounts of nonperforming and restructured loans as of December 31 of each year presented. All loans where information exists about possible credit problems that would cause us to have serious doubts about the borrower's ability to comply with the current repayment terms of the loan have been reflected in the table below.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccruing loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing loans past due 90 days or more\n</td> <td>12,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>38,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructured loans\n</td> <td>13,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming and restructured loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans to loans\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.74\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquired nonperforming loans that are not covered by FDIC loss-share agreements totaled $23,528 at December 31, 2015 which consisted of $12,070 in loans on nonaccrual status and $11,458 in accruing loans past due 90 days or more.

The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit-taking activities. Management believes a significant impact on the Company's financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure.\nWe have an Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d) which is authorized by the Board of Directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to make decisions relating to that process. The ALCO's goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital. Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis.\nWe utilize an asset/liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model is used to perform both net interest income forecast simulations for multiple year horizons, and economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) analyses, under various interest rate scenarios.\nNet interest income simulations measure the short and medium-term earnings exposure from changes in market interest rates in a rigorous and explicit fashion. Our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios. EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time for a given set of market rate assumptions. An increase in EVE due to a specified rate change indicates an improvement in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet.\nThe following table presents the projected impact of a change in interest rates on (1) static EVE and (2) earnings at risk (that is, net interest income) for the 1-12 and 13-24 month periods commencing January 1, 2016, in each case as compared to the result under rates present in the market on December 31, 2015. The changes in interest rates assume an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve. On account of the present position of the target federal funds rate, the Company did not perform an analysis assuming a downward movement in rates.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change In:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Immediate Change in Rates of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Economic Value Equity (EVE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Earning at Risk (EAR) (Net Interest Income)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Static\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-12 Months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13-24 Months\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.68%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.71)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.10%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.31%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.10)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.13%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.18%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.22%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.91%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate shock results for the net interest income simulations for the next twenty-four months produce a slightly asset sensitive position at December 31, 2015. The Company's interest rate risk strategy is to remain in a slightly asset sensitive position with a focus on balance sheet strategies that will result in a more asset sensitive position over time. To accomplish this strategy, the\nCompany has focused on increasing variable rate loan production and generating deposits that are less sensitive to increases in interest rates. This shift is due largely to the reduction in interest sensitive, but low yielding, short term investments as well as the shift in deposits from higher rate fixed rate time deposits to lower cost but variable rate transaction deposits.\nThe preceding measures assume no change in the size or asset/liability compositions of the balance sheet. Thus, the measures do not reflect actions the ALCO may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates. The above results of the interest rate shock analysis are within the parameters set by the Board of Directors. The scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points. As interest rates are adjusted over a period of time, it is our strategy to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. Key assumptions employed in the model include asset prepayment speeds, competitive factors, the relative price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non-maturity deposits. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results will differ from simulated results.\nThe Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate contracts such as swaps, caps and/or floors, as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure and to facilitate the needs of its customers. The Company enters into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract position. The Company manages its credit risk, or potential risk of default by its commercial customers, through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2015, the Company had notional amounts of $68,409 on interest rate contracts with corporate customers and $68,409 in offsetting interest rate contracts with other financial institutions to mitigate the Company's rate exposure on its corporate customers' contracts and certain fixed-rate loans.\nIn March and April 2012, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements which took effect in March, 2014. Under these agreements, the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread and pays a fixed rate of interest of 4.42% and 5.49%. The agreements, which both terminate in March 2022, are accounted for as cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $32,000 of the Company's junior subordinated debentures. In connection with its acquisition of First M&F, the Company assumed an interest rate swap designed to convert floating rate interest payments into fixed rate payments. Based on the terms of the agreement, which terminates in March 2018, the Company will receive a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread and pay a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge to reduce the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on $30,000 of the junior subordinated debentures assumed in the acquisition of First M&F.\nOn June 5, 2014, the Company entered into two forward interest rate swap contracts on floating rate liabilities at the Bank level with notional amounts of $15,000 each. The interest rate swap contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges with the objective of protecting against any interest rate volatility on future FHLB borrowings for a four-year and five-year period beginning June 1, 2018 and December 3, 2018 and ending June 2022 and June 2023, respectively. Under these contracts, the Bank will pay a fixed interest rate of 3.593% and 3.738%, respectively, and will receive a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR with quarterly net settlements.\nThe Company also enters into interest rate lock commitments with its customers to mitigate the Company's interest rate risk associated with its commitments to fund fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. Under the interest rate lock commitments, interest rates for a mortgage loan are locked in with the customer for a period of time, typically thirty days. Once an interest rate lock commitment is entered into with a customer, the Company also enters into a forward commitment to sell the residential mortgage loan to secondary market investors. Accordingly, the Company does not incur risk if the interest rate lock commitment in the pipeline fails to close.\nFor more information about the Company's derivative financial instruments, see Note S, Derivative Instruments,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs.\nCore deposits, which are deposits excluding time deposits and public fund deposits, are a major source of funds used by Renasant Bank to meet cash flow needs. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to assuring Renasant Bank's liquidity. Management continually monitors the liquidity and non-core dependency ratios to ensure compliance with targets established by the Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d).\nOur investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Within the next twelve months the securities portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow through principal payments and maturities equal to 14.14% of the carrying value of the total securities portfolio. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2015, securities with a carrying value of $718,767 were pledged to secure government, public, trust, and other deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings and derivative instruments as compared to $633,599 at December 31, 2014.\nOther sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds purchased and advances from the FHLB. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Federal funds are short term borrowings, generally overnight borrowings, between financial institutions that are used to maintain reserve requirements at the Federal Reserve Bank. The balance of outstanding federal funds purchased at December 31, 2015 was $400,000. Outstanding federal funds purchased on December 31, 2014 was $26,300. Funds obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to match-fund fixed rate loans in order to minimize interest rate risk and may also be used to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract deposits. At December 31, 2015, the balance of our outstanding advances with the FHLB was $52,930. The total amount of the remaining credit available to us from the FHLB at December 31, 2015 was $1,659,779. We also maintain lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $75,000. These are unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit maturing at various times within the next twelve months. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2015 or 2014, respectively.\nThe following table presents, by type, the Company's funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, and the total cost of each funding source for each of the years presented:\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost of Funds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>19.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.20\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>43.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>7.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>23.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td>0.98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other borrowed funds\n</td> <td>5.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits and borrowed funds\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur strategy in choosing funds is focused on minimizing cost along with considering our balance sheet composition and interest rate risk position. Accordingly, management targets growth of non-interest bearing deposits. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer. We constantly monitor our funds position and evaluate the effect that various funding sources have on our financial position. Our cost of funds decreased 10 basis points in 2015, 2014, and 2013 as management improved our funding mix using non-interest bearing or lower costing deposits and repaying higher costing funding including time deposits and borrowed funds.\nCash and cash equivalents were $211,571 at December 31, 2015, compared to $161,583 at December 31, 2014 and $246,648 at December 31, 2013. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $247,431 compared to cash used in investing activities of $202,802 in 2014 and $57,150 in 2013. Proceeds from the sale, maturity or call of securities within our investment portfolio were $265,556 for 2015 compared to $217,417 for 2014 and $206,515 in 2013. For 2015, these proceeds from the investment portfolio were primarily reinvested back into the security portfolio or used to fund loan growth. Purchases of investment securities were $216,141 for 2015 compared to $280,164 for 2014 and $233,221 for 2013.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $44,794 compared to cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $6,946 and cash provided by financing activities during 2013 of $18,092. Overall deposits increased $2,218 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to a decrease of $3,494 for the same period in 2014 and an increase of $54,661 for the year end 2013.\nRestrictions on Bank Dividends, Loans and Advances\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources, as well as its ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, are substantially dependent on the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. Under Mississippi law, a Mississippi bank may not pay dividends unless its earned surplus is in excess of three times capital stock. A Mississippi bank with earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock may pay a dividend, subject to the approval of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. Accordingly, the approval of this supervisory authority is required prior to the Bank paying dividends to the Company.\nFederal Reserve regulations also limit the amount the Bank may loan to the Company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations. At December 31, 2015, the maximum amount available for transfer from the Bank to the Company in the form of loans was $70,159. The Company maintains a line of credit collateralized by cash with the Bank totaling $3,030. There were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2015. These restrictions did not have any impact on the Company's ability to meet its cash obligations, nor does management expect such restrictions to materially impact the Company's ability to meet its currently-anticipated cash obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nThe Company enters into loan commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of its business. Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of the Company's customers. Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company's normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management's credit assessment of the customer.\nLoan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company in that while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The Company's unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,131,842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>706,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>630,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>37,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company closely monitors the amount of remaining future commitments to borrowers in light of prevailing economic conditions and adjusts these commitments as necessary. The Company will continue this process as new commitments are entered into or existing commitments are renewed.\nFor more information about the Company's off-balance sheet transactions, see Note L, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2015, significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date.

Book value per share was $25.73 and $22.56 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The growth in shareholders' equity was attributable to the acquisition of Heritage as well as earnings retention offset by dividends declared and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nOn September 15, 2015, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC. The shelf registration statement, which was effective upon filing, allows the Company to raise capital from time to time through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, or a combination thereof, subject to market conditions. Specific terms and prices will be determined at the time of any offering under a separate prospectus supplement that the Company will be required to file with the SEC at the time of the specific offering. The proceeds of the sale of securities, if and when offered, will be used for general corporate purposes as described in any prospectus supplement and could include the expansion of the Company's banking, insurance and wealth management operations as well as other business opportunities.\nThe Company has junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $95,095 at December 31, 2015, of which $91,907 are included in the Company's Tier 1 capital. Federal Reserve guidelines limiting the amount of securities that, similar to our junior subordinated debentures, are includable in Tier 1 capital, but these guidelines did not impact the amount of debentures we include in Tier 1 capital. Although our existing junior subordinated debentures are unaffected by these Federal Reserve guidelines, on account of changes enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, any trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 may not be included in Tier 1 capital.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the following classifications:\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Currency approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act that call for broad and comprehensive revision of regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations (the Basel III Rules\u201d). The Basel III Rules implemented a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement and other items that affected the calculation of the numerator of a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios. Additionally, the Basel III Rules apply limits to a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not maintain a \"capital conservation buffer,\" which is a specified amount of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio includes common equity as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and does not include any other type of non-common equity under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Banks are now required to have common equity Tier 1 capital of 4.5% of average assets, Tier 1 capital of 6% of average assets, as compared to the current 4%, and total capital of 8% of risk-weighted assets to be categorized as adequately capitalized. The Basel III Rules require the phase-out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies of the Company's size in equal installments over a defined period.\nFurther, the Basel III Rules changed the agencies' general risk-based capital requirements for determining risk-weighted assets, which will affect the calculation of the denominator of a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios. The Basel III Rules have revised the agencies' rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and will incorporate certain international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set forth in the standardized approach of the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework\u201d.\nThe calculation of risk-weighted assets in the denominator of the Basel III capital ratios would be adjusted to reflect the higher risk nature of certain types of loans. Specifically, as applicable to the Company and the Bank:\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Residential mortgages: Replaces the current 50% risk weight for performing residential first-lien mortgages and a 100% risk-weight for all other mortgages with a risk weight of between 35% and 200% determined by the mortgage's loan-to-value ratio and whether the mortgage falls into one of two categories based on eight criteria that include the term, use of negative amortization and balloon payments, certain rate increases and documented and verified borrower income.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Commercial mortgages: Replaces the current 100% risk weight with a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Nonperforming loans: Replaces the current 100% risk weight with a 150% risk weight for loans, other than residential mortgages, that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual status.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGenerally, the new Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, although parts of the Basel III Rules will be phased in through 2019. Management is reviewing the new rules to assess their impact on the Company.\nSEC Form 10-K\nA COPY OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, MAY BE OBTAINED WITHOUT CHARGE BY DIRECTING A WRITTEN REQUEST TO: JOHN S.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nPerformance Overview\nNet income was $68,014 for 2015 compared to $59,582 for 2014 and $33,487 for 2013. The fluctuation in net income since 2013 was influenced by a number of factors:\n - Effective July 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition by merger with Heritage Financial Group, Inc. ( Heritage\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Albany, Georgia, in a transaction valued at $295,380. The Company issued approximately 8.6 million shares of common stock and paid $5,915 to Heritage stock option holders for 100% of the voting equity interest in Heritage. On July 1, 2015, Heritage operated 48 banking, mortgage and investment offices in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, which are still being finalized by the Company and are subject to change, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2,014,882, including loans both held for sale and held for investment with a fair value of $1,460,242, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,719,502, including deposits with a fair value of $1,375,354. The Company recorded approximately $183,438 in intangible assets which consist of goodwill of $171,182 and a core deposit intangible of $12,256. - On September 1, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of First M&F Corporation ( First M&F\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Kosciusko, Mississippi, which operated 35 full-service banking offices and eight insurance offices throughout Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama. The Company issued approximately 6.2 million shares of its common stock for 100% of the voting equity interests in First M&F in a transaction valued at $156,845. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $1,516,603 including loans with a fair value of $899,236, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,361,079, including deposits with a fair value of $1,325,872. At the acquisition date, approximately $90,127 of goodwill and $25,032 of core deposit intangible assets were recorded. - Net interest income increased 19.20% to $241,358 for 2015 as compared to $202,482 for 2014; net interest income was $157,133 for 2013. Interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 15.88% to $270,278 for 2015 from $233,246 for 2014. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was due primarily to the increase in average earnings assets from the acquisition of Heritage. Interest expense decreased 9.45% to $21,665 for 2015 compared to $23,927 for 2014; interest expense was $23,471 for 2013. - Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.10% in 2015 compared to 0.29% in 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.22% in 2013. The provision for loan losses was $4,750 for 2015 compared to $6,167 for 2014 and $10,350 for 2013. - Noninterest income was $108,270 for 2015 compared to $80,509 for 2014 and $71,891 for 2013. The growth in noninterest income in 2015 when compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the Heritage acquisition, the addition of the Heritage mortgage division and growth in our mortgage division. The Company also experienced an increase in income from the Insurance and Wealth Management divisions after the acquisition of First M&F which was completed late in the third quarter of 2013. Our goal is to continue developing products that generate noninterest income in order to diversify our revenue streams. - Noninterest expenses were $245,114 for 2015 compared to $190,937 for 2014 and $172,928 for 2013. The increase in noninterest expense during the three year period is primarily attributable to the integration of operating expenses of the acquired Heritage and First M&F operations. The Company recorded merger expenses in connection with these acquisitions of $11,614, $694, and $6,027 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. - Loans, net of unearned income, were $5,413,462 at December 31, 2015 compared to $3,987,874 in 2014 and $3,881,018 in 2013. Excluding the acquired loans of $1,583,028 at December 31, 2015, the portfolio increased in size by $562,948 from December 31, 2014. - Deposits totaled $6,218,602 at December 31, 2015 compared to $4,838,418 at December 31, 2014 and $4,841,912 at December 31, 2013. The growth in deposits from 2015 to 2014 was attributable to the acquisition of Heritage, which added $1,266,921 in deposits at December 31, 2014. Management's strategy to build and maintain a stable source of funding through core deposits, driven by noninterest-bearing deposits, has allowed for certain higher costing time deposits to mature or expire without renewal, some of which have been replaced with noninterest-bearing deposits and other lower costing deposits. \nA historical look at key performance indicators is presented below.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts. Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions used and considers other factors which could impact these estimates. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards, are discussed in further detail in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following discussion presents some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies\u201d ( ASC 450\u201d). Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310, Receivables\u201d ( ASC 310\u201d). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under ASC 310 and the related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment. Additionally, the estimate of the allowance required to absorb credit losses in the entire portfolio may change due to shifts in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and in prevailing economic conditions, as evidenced by changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates and energy costs. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For a discussion of other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nCertain loans acquired in acquisitions or mergers are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d). ASC 310-30 prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in which the acquirer concludes that it will not collect the contractual amount. As a result, these loans are carried at values which represent management's estimate of the future cash flows of these loans. Increases in expected cash flows to be collected from the contractual cash flows are required to be recognized as an adjustment of the loan's yield over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are required to be recognized as an impairment. A more detailed discussion of loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, which were acquired in connection with our mergers with Heritage in 2015, First M&F in 2013, Capital Bancorp, Inc. in 2007 and with Heritage Financial Holding Corporation in 2005 and our acquisitions of Crescent and American Trust in FDIC-assisted transactions in 2010 and 2011, respectively, is set forth below under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and in Note D, Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther-Than-Temporary-Impairment on Investment Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate our investment portfolio for other-than-temporary-impairment ( OTTI\u201d) in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d An investment security is considered impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost basis. Impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary if the Company intends to sell the investment security or if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security before the Company is required to sell the security or the security's maturity. When impairment of an equity security is considered to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in earnings. When impairment of a debt security is considered to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value. The amount of OTTI recorded as a loss in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the debt security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell the debt security or more\nlikely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI is separated into the amount representing credit loss and the amount related to all other market factors. The amount related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount related to other market factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nThe amount of OTTI recorded in earnings as a credit loss is dependent upon management's estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from the investment security. The difference between the expected cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the security is considered to be credit loss. The remaining difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the security is considered to be related to all other market factors. Our estimate of discounted future cash flows incorporates a number of assumptions based on both qualitative and quantitative factors. Performance indicators of the security's underlying assets, including credit ratings and current and projected default and deferral rates, as well as the credit quality and capital ratios of the issuing institutions are considered in the analysis. Changes in these assumptions could impact the amount of OTTI recognized as a credit loss in earnings. For additional information regarding the evaluation of our securities portfolio for OTTI, please refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d and Note C, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and customer relationship intangibles. Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements of the business acquired. We review the goodwill of each of our reporting units (that is, our reportable segments for financial accounting purposes) for impairment on an annual basis, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use both the market and discounted cash flow approaches. The market approach averages the values derived by applying a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions, to the book value, tangible book value, loan and/or deposit balances and the last twelve months adjusted and unadjusted net income. The discounted cash flow approach requires assumptions about short and long-term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. Long-term net cash flow forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations.\nWe assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by reference to our market capitalization; however, due to the significant volatility in the equity markets with respect to the financial institution sector since 2008, we also consulted supplemental information based on observable market multiples, adjusting to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions. In some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's equity exceeds its estimated fair value, we then calculate the fair value of the reporting unit's implied goodwill. Implied goodwill is the excess fair value of a reporting unit (as determined using the above-described methodology) over the fair value of its net assets and is calculated by determining the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized intangible assets, on an individual basis. This calculation is performed in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.\nOther identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent any other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded as a noninterest expense to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, when or if they occur, could be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.\nBenefit Plans and Stock Based Compensation\nOur independent actuary firm prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d ( ASC 715\u201d). The discount rate utilized in the December 31, 2015 valuation was 4.00%, compared to 4.83% in 2014. Actual plan assets as of December 31, 2015 were used in the calculation and the expected long-term return on plan assets assumed for this valuation was 8.00%. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the benefit plan obligation and the funded status of the plan which in turn may impact shareholders' equity through an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income and future pension expense. The pension plan covered under ASC 715 was frozen as of December 31, 1996.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d We utilize the Black-Scholes model for determining fair value of our options. Determining the fair value of, and ultimately the expense we recognize related to, our stock options requires us to make assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected stock price volatility, estimated forfeitures and the expected life of the option. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock-based compensation and the related expense to be recognized. Due to the low historical forfeiture rate, the Company did not estimate any forfeitures in determining the fair value of options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Changes in this assumption in the future could result in lower expenses related to the Company's stock options. For a description of our assumptions utilized in calculating the fair value of our share-based payments, please refer to Note N, Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBusiness Combinations, Accounting for Acquired Loans and Related Assets\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value measurements of acquired loans are based on estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nOver the life of the acquired loans, the Company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics. The Company evaluates, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, the present value of the acquired loans determined using the effective interest rates. If the cash flows expected to be collected have decreased, the Company recognizes a provision for loan loss in its consolidated statement of income; for any increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the loan's or pool's remaining life.\nBecause the FDIC will reimburse the Company for losses related to a portion of the loans acquired in the Crescent, American Trust, Citizens Bank of Effingham and First Southern National Bank transactions (see Loans\u201d below), an indemnification asset is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The indemnification asset is recognized at the same time as the indemnified loans and measured on the same basis, subject to collectability or contractual limitations. The fair value of the indemnification asset reflects the reimbursements expected to be received from the FDIC, using an appropriate discount rate, which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties.\nThe indemnification asset is measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the indemnification asset also follow that model. Decreases in the future cash flows expected to be collected on the loans immediately increase the fair value of the indemnification asset. Increases in the future cash flows expected to be collected on the loans decrease the fair value of the indemnification asset, with such decrease being accreted into interest income over (1) the same period or (2) the life of the fair value of the indemnification asset, whichever is shorter. Loss assumptions used in the basis of the indemnified loans are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the indemnification asset. Fair value accounting incorporates into the fair value of the indemnification asset an element of the time value of money, which is accreted back into income over the life of the shared loss agreements.\nUpon the determination of an incurred loss the indemnification asset will be reduced by the amount owed by the FDIC. A corresponding receivable is recorded on the balance sheet until cash is received from the FDIC.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nThe Company recognizes as assets the right to service certain mortgage loans for others, known as mortgage servicing rights. The mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income. External valuations of the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights are obtained monthly and determined using various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs mortgage interest rates and other factors. These assumptions can, and generally will, change as market condition and interest rates change resulting in fluctuations of the fair value. The Company does not currently hedge the mortgage servicing right asset. At December 31, 2015, the Company's mortgage servicing asset was valued at $29,642. For additional information regarding our mortgage servicing rights, please refer to Note H - Mortgage Servicing Rights,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of a loan obligation. Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair market value based on appraised value less selling costs, estimated as of the date acquired, with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses.\nReductions in the carrying value subsequent to acquisition are charged to earnings. The fair value of other real estate owned is derived primarily from independent appraisers. Our internal policies generally require OREO properties to be appraised every 12 months. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility, as experienced during the last few years. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes\nAccrued taxes represent the estimated amount payable to or receivable from taxing jurisdictions, either currently or in the future, and are reported, on a net basis, as a component of Other assets\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our income tax expense is complex and requires the use of many estimates and judgments in its determination.\nManagement's determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax assets.\nFor certain business plans enacted by the Company, management bases the estimates of related tax liabilities on its belief that future events will validate management's current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of tax-related exposures. As part of this process, management consults with its outside advisers to assess the relative merits and risks of our proposed tax treatment of such business plans. Although we have received from these outside advisers opinions that our proposed tax treatment should prevail, the examination of our income tax returns, changes in tax law and regulatory guidance may impact the tax treatment of these transactions and resulting provisions for income taxes.\nWe believe that we employ appropriate methods for these calculations and that the results of such calculations closely approximate the actual cost. We review the calculated results for reasonableness and compare those calculations to prior period costs. We also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax accounting, please refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTotal assets were $7,926,496 at December 31, 2015 compared to $5,805,129 at December 31, 2014 and $5,746,270 at December 31, 2013. The acquisition of Heritage increased total assets $2,014,882 at July 1, 2015.\nInvestments\nThe securities portfolio is used to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs and to supply securities to be used in collateralizing certain deposits and other types of borrowings. The following table shows the carrying value of our securities portfolio by investment type and the percentage of such investment type relative to the entire securities portfolio, at December 31:\n\nThe balance of our securities portfolio at December 31, 2015 increased $121,458 to $1,105,205 from $983,747 at December 31, 2014. The acquisition of Heritage added $177,849 in investment securities. During 2015, we purchased $216,141 in investment\nsecurities. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), in the aggregate, comprised 33.36% of the purchases. CMOs are included in the Mortgage-backed securities\u201d line item in the above table. The mortgage-backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are primarily issued by government sponsored entities. U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities accounted for 46.73% and 19.91%, respectively, of total securities purchased in 2015. There were $8,348 of securities sold during 2015 resulting in a net gain of $96. Proceeds from maturities, calls and sales of securities during 2015 totaled $265,556.\nThe balance of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 increased $70,418 to $983,747 compared to $913,329 at December 31, 2013. During 2014, we purchased $280,164 in investment securities. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, in the aggregate, comprised 44.26% of the purchases. U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities accounted for 41.40% and 14.24%, respectively, of total securities purchased in 2014. The carrying value of securities sold during 2014 totaled $724 resulting in a net gain of $375. Proceeds from maturities, calls and sales of securities during 2014 totaled $217,417.\nAt December 31, 2015 , unrealized losses of $9,545 were recorded on available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of $309,549. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, unrealized losses of $10,466 and $20,041, respectively, were recorded on investment securities with a carrying value of $203,467 and $279,165, respectively. The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company has experienced an overall improvement in the fair value of its investment portfolio and is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective issuers as scheduled. As such, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nThe Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities. This portfolio had a cost basis of $24,770 and $26,400 and a fair value of $19,469 and $19,756 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The investment in pooled trust preferred securities consists of three securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over 250 financial institutions. Management's determination of the fair value of each of its holdings is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing financial institutions and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the cash flow for our tranches is negatively impacted. The Company's quarterly evaluation of these investments for other-than-temporary-impairment resulted in no additional write-downs during 2015, 2014 or 2013. Furthermore, the Company's analysis of the pooled trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2015 supported a return to accrual status for one of the three securities (XXVI). During the second quarter of 2014, the Company's analysis supported a return to accrual status for one of the other securities (XXIII). An observed history of principal and interest payments combined with improved qualitative and quantitative factors described above justified the accrual of interest on these securities. However, the remaining security (XXIV) is still in payment in kind\u201d status where interest payments are not expected until a future date and therefore, the qualitative and quantitative factors described above do not justify a return to accrual status at this time. As a result, pooled trust preferred security XXIV remains classified as nonaccruing asset at December 31, 2015, and investment interest is", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nPerformance Overview\nNet income was $68,014 for 2015 compared to $59,582 for 2014 and $33,487 for 2013. The fluctuation in net income since 2013 was influenced by a number of factors:\n - Effective July 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition by merger with Heritage Financial Group, Inc. ( Heritage\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Albany, Georgia, in a transaction valued at $295,380. The Company issued approximately 8.6 million shares of common stock and paid $5,915 to Heritage stock option holders for 100% of the voting equity interest in Heritage. On July 1, 2015, Heritage operated 48 banking, mortgage and investment offices in Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, which are still being finalized by the Company and are subject to change, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2,014,882, including loans both held for sale and held for investment with a fair value of $1,460,242, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,719,502, including deposits with a fair value of $1,375,354. The Company recorded approximately $183,438 in intangible assets which consist of goodwill of $171,182 and a core deposit intangible of $12,256. - On September 1, 2013, the Company completed its acquisition of First M&F Corporation ( First M&F\u201d), a bank holding company headquartered in Kosciusko, Mississippi, which operated 35 full-service banking offices and eight insurance offices throughout Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama. The Company issued approximately 6.2 million shares of its common stock for 100% of the voting equity interests in First M&F in a transaction valued at $156,845. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $1,516,603 including loans with a fair value of $899,236, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,361,079, including deposits with a fair value of $1,325,872. At the acquisition date, approximately $90,127 of goodwill and $25,032 of core deposit intangible assets were recorded. - Net interest income increased 19.20% to $241,358 for 2015 as compared to $202,482 for 2014; net interest income was $157,133 for 2013. Interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased 15.88% to $270,278 for 2015 from $233,246 for 2014. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was due primarily to the increase in average earnings assets from the acquisition of Heritage. Interest expense decreased 9.45% to $21,665 for 2015 compared to $23,927 for 2014; interest expense was $23,471 for 2013. - Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.10% in 2015 compared to 0.29% in 2014. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 0.22% in 2013. The provision for loan losses was $4,750 for 2015 compared to $6,167 for 2014 and $10,350 for 2013. - Noninterest income was $108,270 for 2015 compared to $80,509 for 2014 and $71,891 for 2013. The growth in noninterest income in 2015 when compared to 2014 is primarily attributable to the Heritage acquisition, the addition of the Heritage mortgage division and growth in our mortgage division. The Company also experienced an increase in income from the Insurance and Wealth Management divisions after the acquisition of First M&F which was completed late in the third quarter of 2013. Our goal is to continue developing products that generate noninterest income in order to diversify our revenue streams. - Noninterest expenses were $245,114 for 2015 compared to $190,937 for 2014 and $172,928 for 2013. The increase in noninterest expense during the three year period is primarily attributable to the integration of operating expenses of the acquired Heritage and First M&F operations. The Company recorded merger expenses in connection with these acquisitions of $11,614, $694, and $6,027 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. - Loans, net of unearned income, were $5,413,462 at December 31, 2015 compared to $3,987,874 in 2014 and $3,881,018 in 2013. Excluding the acquired loans of $1,583,028 at December 31, 2015, the portfolio increased in size by $562,948 from December 31, 2014. - Deposits totaled $6,218,602 at December 31, 2015 compared to $4,838,418 at December 31, 2014 and $4,841,912 at December 31, 2013. The growth in deposits from 2015 to 2014 was attributable to the acquisition of Heritage, which added $1,266,921 in deposits at December 31, 2014. Management's strategy to build and maintain a stable source of funding through core deposits, driven by noninterest-bearing deposits, has allowed for certain higher costing time deposits to mature or expire without renewal, some of which have been replaced with noninterest-bearing deposits and other lower costing deposits. \nA historical look at key performance indicators is presented below.\nTable 34: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2011\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS Growth\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.09\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Assets\n</td> <td>0.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Return on Average Shareholders' Equity\n</td> <td>7.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.01\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.34\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts. Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions used and considers other factors which could impact these estimates. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards, are discussed in further detail in Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The following discussion presents some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies\u201d ( ASC 450\u201d). Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310, Receivables\u201d ( ASC 310\u201d). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under ASC 310 and the related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment. Additionally, the estimate of the allowance required to absorb credit losses in the entire portfolio may change due to shifts in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and in prevailing economic conditions, as evidenced by changes in real estate demand and values, interest rates, unemployment rates and energy costs. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For a discussion of other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nCertain loans acquired in acquisitions or mergers are accounted for under ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d). ASC 310-30 prohibits the carryover of an allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in which the acquirer concludes that it will not collect the contractual amount. As a result, these loans are carried at values which represent management's estimate of the future cash flows of these loans. Increases in expected cash flows to be collected from the contractual cash flows are required to be recognized as an adjustment of the loan's yield over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are required to be recognized as an impairment. A more detailed discussion of loans accounted for under ASC 310-30, which were acquired in connection with our mergers with Heritage in 2015, First M&F in 2013, Capital Bancorp, Inc. in 2007 and with Heritage Financial Holding Corporation in 2005 and our acquisitions of Crescent and American Trust in FDIC-assisted transactions in 2010 and 2011, respectively, is set forth below under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and in Note D, Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther-Than-Temporary-Impairment on Investment Securities\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate our investment portfolio for other-than-temporary-impairment ( OTTI\u201d) in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.\u201d An investment security is considered impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost basis. Impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary if the Company intends to sell the investment security or if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security before the Company is required to sell the security or the security's maturity. When impairment of an equity security is considered to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value and an impairment loss is recorded in earnings. When impairment of a debt security is considered to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to its fair value. The amount of OTTI recorded as a loss in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the debt security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If we intend to sell the debt security or more\nlikely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss in earnings. If we do not intend to sell the debt security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, OTTI is separated into the amount representing credit loss and the amount related to all other market factors. The amount related to credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount related to other market factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nThe amount of OTTI recorded in earnings as a credit loss is dependent upon management's estimate of discounted future cash flows expected from the investment security. The difference between the expected cash flows and the amortized cost basis of the security is considered to be credit loss. The remaining difference between the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the security is considered to be related to all other market factors. Our estimate of discounted future cash flows incorporates a number of assumptions based on both qualitative and quantitative factors. Performance indicators of the security's underlying assets, including credit ratings and current and projected default and deferral rates, as well as the credit quality and capital ratios of the issuing institutions are considered in the analysis. Changes in these assumptions could impact the amount of OTTI recognized as a credit loss in earnings. For additional information regarding the evaluation of our securities portfolio for OTTI, please refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d and Note C, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIntangible Assets\nOur intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, core deposit intangibles, and customer relationship intangibles. Goodwill arises from business combinations and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements of the business acquired. We review the goodwill of each of our reporting units (that is, our reportable segments for financial accounting purposes) for impairment on an annual basis, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we use both the market and discounted cash flow approaches. The market approach averages the values derived by applying a market multiple, based on observed purchase transactions, to the book value, tangible book value, loan and/or deposit balances and the last twelve months adjusted and unadjusted net income. The discounted cash flow approach requires assumptions about short and long-term net cash flow growth rates for each reporting unit, as well as discount rates. Long-term net cash flow forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several key business drivers such as new business initiatives, market share changes, anticipated loan and deposit growth, historical performance, and industry and economic trends, among other considerations.\nWe assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of the reporting units by reference to our market capitalization; however, due to the significant volatility in the equity markets with respect to the financial institution sector since 2008, we also consulted supplemental information based on observable market multiples, adjusting to reflect our specific factors, as well as current market conditions.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions. In some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. We perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's equity exceeds its estimated fair value, we then calculate the fair value of the reporting unit's implied goodwill. Implied goodwill is the excess fair value of a reporting unit (as determined using the above-described methodology) over the fair value of its net assets and is calculated by determining the fair value of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities, including previously unrecognized intangible assets, on an individual basis. This calculation is performed in the same manner as goodwill is recognized in a business combination. Significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit.\nOther identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles and customer relationship intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent any other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded as a noninterest expense to reduce the carrying amount. These events or circumstances, when or if they occur, could be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period.\nBenefit Plans and Stock Based Compensation\nOur independent actuary firm prepares actuarial valuations of our pension cost under ASC 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits\u201d ( ASC 715\u201d). The discount rate utilized in the December 31, 2015 valuation was 4.00%, compared to 4.83% in 2014. Actual plan assets as of December 31, 2015 were used in the calculation and the expected long-term return on plan assets assumed for this valuation was 8.00%. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the benefit plan obligation and the funded status of the plan which in turn may impact shareholders' equity through an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income and future pension expense. The pension plan covered under ASC 715 was frozen as of December 31, 1996.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payments to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.\u201d We utilize the Black-Scholes model for determining fair value of our options. Determining the fair value of, and ultimately the expense we recognize related to, our stock options requires us to make assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected stock price volatility, estimated forfeitures and the expected life of the option. Changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock-based compensation and the related expense to be recognized. Due to the low historical forfeiture rate, the Company did not estimate any forfeitures in determining the fair value of options granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013. Changes in this assumption in the future could result in lower expenses related to the Company's stock options. For a description of our assumptions utilized in calculating the fair value of our share-based payments, please refer to Note N, Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nBusiness Combinations, Accounting for Acquired Loans and Related Assets\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk. The fair value measurements of acquired loans are based on estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal, interest and other cash flows.\nOver the life of the acquired loans, the Company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics. The Company evaluates, as of the end of each fiscal quarter, the present value of the acquired loans determined using the effective interest rates. If the cash flows expected to be collected have decreased, the Company recognizes a provision for loan loss in its consolidated statement of income; for any increases in cash flows expected to be collected, the Company adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the loan's or pool's remaining life.\nBecause the FDIC will reimburse the Company for losses related to a portion of the loans acquired in the Crescent, American Trust, Citizens Bank of Effingham and First Southern National Bank transactions (see Loans\u201d below), an indemnification asset is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The indemnification asset is recognized at the same time as the indemnified loans and measured on the same basis, subject to collectability or contractual limitations. The fair value of the indemnification asset reflects the reimbursements expected to be received from the FDIC, using an appropriate discount rate, which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties.\nThe indemnification asset is measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the indemnification asset also follow that model. Decreases in the future cash flows expected to be collected on the loans immediately increase the fair value of the indemnification asset. Increases in the future cash flows expected to be collected on the loans decrease the fair value of the indemnification asset, with such decrease being accreted into interest income over (1) the same period or (2) the life of the fair value of the indemnification asset, whichever is shorter. Loss assumptions used in the basis of the indemnified loans are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the indemnification asset. Fair value accounting incorporates into the fair value of the indemnification asset an element of the time value of money, which is accreted back into income over the life of the shared loss agreements.\nUpon the determination of an incurred loss the indemnification asset will be reduced by the amount owed by the FDIC. A corresponding receivable is recorded on the balance sheet until cash is received from the FDIC.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nThe Company recognizes as assets the right to service certain mortgage loans for others, known as mortgage servicing rights. The mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income. External valuations of the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights are obtained monthly and determined using various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs mortgage interest rates and other factors. These assumptions can, and generally will, change as market condition and interest rates change resulting in fluctuations of the fair value. The Company does not currently hedge the mortgage servicing right asset. At December 31, 2015, the Company's mortgage servicing asset was valued at $29,642. For additional information regarding our mortgage servicing rights, please refer to Note H - Mortgage Servicing Rights,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOther Real Estate Owned\nOther real estate owned consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of a loan obligation. Other real estate owned is initially recorded at fair market value based on appraised value less selling costs, estimated as of the date acquired, with any loss recognized as a charge-off through the allowance for loan losses.\nReductions in the carrying value subsequent to acquisition are charged to earnings. The fair value of other real estate owned is derived primarily from independent appraisers. Our internal policies generally require OREO properties to be appraised every 12 months. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate owned, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility, as experienced during the last few years. As a result, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates used to determine the fair value of other real estate owned.\nIncome Taxes\nAccrued taxes represent the estimated amount payable to or receivable from taxing jurisdictions, either currently or in the future, and are reported, on a net basis, as a component of Other assets\u201d in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The calculation of our income tax expense is complex and requires the use of many estimates and judgments in its determination.\nManagement's determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the Company and its subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax assets.\nFor certain business plans enacted by the Company, management bases the estimates of related tax liabilities on its belief that future events will validate management's current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of tax-related exposures. As part of this process, management consults with its outside advisers to assess the relative merits and risks of our proposed tax treatment of such business plans. Although we have received from these outside advisers opinions that our proposed tax treatment should prevail, the examination of our income tax returns, changes in tax law and regulatory guidance may impact the tax treatment of these transactions and resulting provisions for income taxes.\nWe believe that we employ appropriate methods for these calculations and that the results of such calculations closely approximate the actual cost. We review the calculated results for reasonableness and compare those calculations to prior period costs. We also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations.\nFor additional information regarding our income tax accounting, please refer to Note A, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTotal assets were $7,926,496 at December 31, 2015 compared to $5,805,129 at December 31, 2014 and $5,746,270 at December 31, 2013. The acquisition of Heritage increased total assets $2,014,882 at July 1, 2015.\nInvestments\nThe securities portfolio is used to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs and to supply securities to be used in collateralizing certain deposits and other types of borrowings.

The acquisition of Heritage added $177,849 in investment securities. During 2015, we purchased $216,141 in investment\nsecurities. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), in the aggregate, comprised 33.36% of the purchases. CMOs are included in the Mortgage-backed securities\u201d line item in the above table. The mortgage-backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are primarily issued by government sponsored entities. U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities accounted for 46.73% and 19.91%, respectively, of total securities purchased in 2015. There were $8,348 of securities sold during 2015 resulting in a net gain of $96. Proceeds from maturities, calls and sales of securities during 2015 totaled $265,556.\nThe balance of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 increased $70,418 to $983,747 compared to $913,329 at December 31, 2013. During 2014, we purchased $280,164 in investment securities. Mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, in the aggregate, comprised 44.26% of the purchases. U.S. Government Agency securities and municipal securities accounted for 41.40% and 14.24%, respectively, of total securities purchased in 2014. The carrying value of securities sold during 2014 totaled $724 resulting in a net gain of $375. Proceeds from maturities, calls and sales of securities during 2014 totaled $217,417.\nAt December 31, 2015 , unrealized losses of $9,545 were recorded on available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of $309,549. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, unrealized losses of $10,466 and $20,041, respectively, were recorded on investment securities with a carrying value of $203,467 and $279,165, respectively. The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company has experienced an overall improvement in the fair value of its investment portfolio and is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective issuers as scheduled. As such, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 or 2013.\nThe Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities. This portfolio had a cost basis of $24,770 and $26,400 and a fair value of $19,469 and $19,756 at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The investment in pooled trust preferred securities consists of three securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over 250 financial institutions. Management's determination of the fair value of each of its holdings is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing financial institutions and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the cash flow for our tranches is negatively impacted. The Company's quarterly evaluation of these investments for other-than-temporary-impairment resulted in no additional write-downs during 2015, 2014 or 2013. Furthermore, the Company's analysis of the pooled trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2015 supported a return to accrual status for one of the three securities (XXVI). During the second quarter of 2014, the Company's analysis supported a return to accrual status for one of the other securities (XXIII). An observed history of principal and interest payments combined with improved qualitative and quantitative factors described above justified the accrual of interest on these securities. However, the remaining security (XXIV) is still in payment in kind\u201d status where interest payments are not expected until a future date and therefore, the qualitative and quantitative factors described above do not justify a return to accrual status at this time. As a result, pooled trust preferred security XXIV remains classified as nonaccruing asset at December 31, 2015, and investment interest is"}
