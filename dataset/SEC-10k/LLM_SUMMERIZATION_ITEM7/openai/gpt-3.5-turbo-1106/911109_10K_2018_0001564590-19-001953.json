This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d The tables and information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) section were derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nOverview\nExecutive Summary\nThroughout 2018, our continuing operational strategic goals included growing revenue and expanding our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency. To achieve these goals, we concentrated on generating growth in our core rental business through strong organic growth. We also leveraged our new ERP system functionality and other technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies, including mobile applications for both our employees and our customers and processes around the management of fleet.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our network includes 117 Storage Solutions locations, 20 Tank & Pump locations and 17 combined locations. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 195,600 units and our Tank & Pump Solutions business has a fleet of approximately 12,600 units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our achievements included:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Grew total rental revenues 11.9% year-over-year\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Within our Storage Solutions business, which represented approximately 80% of rental revenue in 2018:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Grew total rental revenues 10.1% year-over-year,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Increased year-over-year Storage Solutions rental rates by 2.4%, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Increased average units on rent by 3.5%,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Successfully positioned our Tank & Pump Solutions business to take advantage of positive trends in our underlying markets, which resulted in:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Year-over-year rental revenue growth of 20.1%,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Increased average equipment on rent (based on original equipment cost) by 20.8% year-over-year, with sequential increases in each quarter, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> Year-over-year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Generated adjusted EBITDA of $217.2 million, with a 36.6% margin,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Implemented digital and mobile solutions across our businesses to drive market share, especially with large customers that value this deepened technology, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Generated $72.9 million in free cash flow and returned $44.5 million to shareholders through dividends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Decreased leverage ratio to 4.2x as of December 31, 2018, from 5.0x as of December 31, 2017 (leverage ratio calculated by dividing debt, less cash, by adjusted EBITDA).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAsset Impairment Charge and Loss on Divestiture, Net of Proceeds\nConsistent with our strategy to focus on high returning assets, during the second quarter of 2018 we initiated an organization-wide project to assess the economic and operational status of our fleet and other assets as well as an in-depth analysis of our fleet management process to identify inefficiencies. The result of this review was the identification of specific assets over which a further determination as to the economics of continued retention and repair could be made. In July 2018, management presented a proposed plan of sale for certain identified assets to the Board of Directors, and on July 24, the Board of Directors made the strategic decision to approve the plan and authorized management to begin actively marketing the assets for sale. As a result, we classified these assets, which were primarily rental fleet, as held for sale and recognized a loss of $102.1 million in 2018. We also identified and placed as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and inventory that were not being used efficiently. The assets represent a subset of larger asset groups held by the Company. As of December 31, 2018, the sale was completed.\nBecause the majority of these units were not producing revenue we do not anticipate the disposal of these assets to have any impact on our ability to generate revenue or to meet customer demand, nor do we expect a material impact on our liquidity or free cash flow, including planned capital expenditures. Overall, between the disposal of fleet and our strengthened processes, we expect operating expense savings of approximately $5 million to $7 million annually. The savings includes reductions in labor, repairs and maintenance and lease costs. In 2018 we realized savings of approximately $2 million related to the fleet divestiture and new strengthened processes around fleet management. We expect to implement all costs savings measures by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In addition, as a result of the reduction to our fleet and property, plant and equipment we expect depreciation expense to decrease approximately $0.9 million per quarter.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $77.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company finalized its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act passed in December 2017 and in the current year recorded a reduction of $2.6 million to provisional amounts that were recorded in the prior year.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nApproximately 66% of our rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 was derived from our North American Storage Solutions business, 20% was derived from our Tank & Pump Solutions business in North America and 14% was derived from our U.K. Storage Solutions business. Our business is subject to the general health of the economy and we utilize a variety of general economic indicators to assess market trends and determine the direction of our business. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (the E.U.\u201d) in a referendum vote, which may have currently unknown social, geopolitical and economic impacts. The withdrawal negotiations began in 2017, and are still continuing. The date of the U.K.'s departure from the E.U. is set for March 29, 2019. As developments and their impact become clearer, we may adjust our strategy and operations accordingly.\nBased on our current forecasts and assessment, we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to drive demand for our products. In particular, construction, which represents approximately 36% of our consolidated rental revenue, is forecasted for continued growth in absolute terms but the rate of growth is expected to slow as compared to 2018. Economic indicators related to our industrial and commercial end-segment are also favorable with positive trends in production and capacity utilization. Industrial and commercial customers, which comprise approximately 25% of our rental revenue, generally operate in industries such as: large processing plants for organic and inorganic chemicals, refineries, distributors and trucking and utility companies. Our national retail accounts typically involve seasonal demand in the third and fourth quarter during the holiday season. Retail and consumer service customers comprise approximately 25% of our revenue and include department, drug, grocery and strip mall stores as well as hotels, restaurants, service stations and dry cleaners.\nAccounting and Operating Overview\nOur principal operating revenues and expenses are:\nRevenues:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Rental revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our rental fleet.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Sales revenues consist primarily of sales of new and used fleet and, to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCosts and Expenses:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Rental, selling and general expenses include, among other expenses, payroll and payroll-related costs (including share-based compensation and commissions for our sales team), fleet transportation and fuel costs, repair and maintenance costs for our rental fleet and transportation equipment, real estate lease expense, insurance costs, and general corporate expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations includes the net book value of the units that were sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy, transport, remanufacture and modify used containers and our cost to manufacture Storage Solutions units and other structures, and to a lesser extent the costs of parts and supplies sold to customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on our rental fleet, our property, plant and equipment, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also evaluate our operations on a constant currency basis. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6.

In the prior year, $435.5 million, or 81.6%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 18.4%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $40.9 million, or 10.1%, as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 2.4% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 3.5% increase in units on rent as well as favorable mix and increases in delivery and pickup revenue. Yield (calculated as rental revenues divided by average units on rent) increased approximately 6.3% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by increased rates, favorable mix and increased delivery and pickup revenue. Beginning in the second half of 2017, we successfully leveraged our technology, footprint and fleet capacity to partner with our National Account customers, which continued to drive year-over-year growth in 2018, especially in the first half of 2018. During 2018 we began to pursue partnerships with other rental companies to provide supplementary product offerings for certain of our Storage Solutions\ncustomers. Arranging these comprehensive rental services for our customers increases loyalty while generating additional rental revenue, without additional investment in fleet. While these revenues were not material for the fourth quarter or the full year of 2018, we do expect to continue to develop these revenues.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $18.5 million, or 20.1%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by an approximately 20.8% increase in fleet on rent for the current year. Overall, rates were challenged in the first half of 2018, however, we had year-over-year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent throughout the last six months of the year. Demand from our downstream customers increased overall and maintenance projects that were postponed throughout much of 2017 returned to normalized levels. We believe we are performing better than the market by leveraging our superior service and national footprint with our larger customers. Additionally, we experienced a year-over-year increase in upstream business due to increased activity in the oil and gas segment. Our salesforce has also successfully pursued new diversified customers in local geographies and we gained traction throughout 2018 on several new or extended customer contracts signed late in 2017 and early 2018.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $2.0 million, or 7.6%, to $29.0 million, compared to $27.0 million in the prior-year period. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 decreased $0.1 million to $5.3 million, compared to $5.4 million in the prior-year period.\nCosts and Expenses.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 of $364.1 million increased $27.7 million, or 8.2%, as compared to 2017. Of this total increase, $19.6 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $8.1 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 61.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which was down from 63.1% in 2017.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business rental, selling and general expenses in the prior-year period was $2.6 million of expense related to the severance and transition of an executive. Excluding this expense, rental, selling and general expenses increased $22.3 million, an 8.4% increase from the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher transportation, salary and re-rent costs required to support the additional rental activity as well as an increase in variable compensation in the\ncurrent year, as compared to the prior year. Also contributing to the year-over-year difference is increased stock-based compensation expense due to the anticipated achievement of certain goals related to our performance-based stock award plan.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $8.1 million, or 11.8%, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. The increase was largely due to increased transportation costs to support the additional rental activity as well as an increase in variable compensation in the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $19.4 million and $17.9 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.6 million and $9.1 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales profit expressed as a percentage of sales revenue (sales profit margin) was 33.0% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 33.6% in the prior-year period.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.0 million and $3.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.3 million and $2.4 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The $2.0 million of restructuring expenses recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, consisted primarily of expense related to the restructuring of our corporate service center, including the severance of an executive, and expense incurred in conjunction with the divestiture of certain assets as discussed earlier in this MD&A. Additionally in 2018, we recognized expenses related to projects initiated in prior years that were not accruable during such periods.\nOf the $2.9 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, approximately $1.3 million related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure and $0.9 million consisted of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expense related largely to division and corporate departmental restructurings.\nAsset impairment charge and loss on divestiture, net. As discussed in the overview section of this MD&A, during the current period we identified specific underperforming assets to classify as held for sale. As a result, we recognized a loss of $102.1 million in the year.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $67.0 million increased 5.7% in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017. The majority of this increase relates to depreciation on property, plant and equipment.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $40.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $35.7 million in the prior-year period. This 14.5% increase is due to a higher effective interest rate on our lines of credit, partially offset by an overall decrease in debt outstanding. Our average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $917.8 million, compared to $934.5 million in the prior year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 4.2% and 3.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs. Taking into account the amortization of deferred financing costs, the weighted average interest rate was 4.5% and 3.8% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (51.8%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by the $102.1 million asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture which resulted in a $5.3 million loss before income taxes. As a result of the low pre-tax loss, the permanent differences between actual income and taxable income are having a meaningful effect on the tax rate. The nondeductible items include $5.8 million in tax expense related to prior-period share-based compensation, offset by a $2.6 million reduction in our provisional tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings for the impact of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.\nExcluding the asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture, the reversal of deferred tax assets related to nondeductible share-based compensation expense of $5.8 million, and the $2.6 million reduction to our provisional tax expense for U.S. Tax Reform, our income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.7 million and the effective tax rate was 25.5%. The decrease in the effective tax rate as compared to the 2017 effective rate was primarily due to the reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, partially offset by the increase in disallowed deductions for officers' compensation, both of which are a result of the Tax Act enacted in 2017. Based on information currently available to us, we estimate that our 2019 effective tax rate will be between 25% and 27%.\nThe effective income tax (benefit) rate of (64.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the accounting for the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Excluding the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 35.6%.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $150.5 million, which expires, if unused, from 2029 to 2034. In addition, we had net operating loss carryforwards in the various states in which we operate. Over the past three years, we have generated $113.5 million of federal taxable income. At December 31, 2018, we had $71.3 million of gross deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet, and a $1.0 million valuation allowance. We believe, based on internal projections, that we will generate sufficient taxable income needed to realize the corresponding unreserved federal and state deferred tax assets to the extent they are recorded as deferred tax assets in our balance sheet. However, given that the federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over six years beginning in 2029, there could be changes in management's judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets. See Note 8 Income Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes.\nNet (Loss) Income. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we had a net loss of $8.1 million. The loss was driven by our impairment charge and loss on divestiture, which more than offset our increased revenues. This loss compares to net income of $122.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The net income for 2017 was affected by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $74.5 million related to income tax legislation enacted in December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $217.2 million, an increase of $32.4 million, or 17.6%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million in the prior year. The increase was generated by strong growth in both our Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump Solutions businesses, and was partially offset by overall increased rental, selling and general costs. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 36.6% and 34.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin is due to increased efficiencies and our ability to leverage our infrastructure to grow revenue at a higher rate than expense.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business increased $22.1 million, or 14.0%, to $180.1 million from $158.0 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $10.3 million, or 38.4%, to $37.2 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from $26.8 million during the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were 37.8% for the Storage Solutions business and 32.0% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,

In 2016, $410.6 million, or 80.7%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 19.3%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $19.4 million, or 5.0%, as compared to 2016. Adjusting for an unfavorable change in currency translation rates rental revenue increased approximately 6.0%, as compared to 2016. The increase was driven by a 3.1% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 4.6% increase in units on rent. Adjusting for the unfavorable currency effect, yield increased approximately 1.4% as compared to 2016, driven by the rate increase in 2017, offset by changes in mix and other rental items. The full year rental revenue increase was impacted by strong fourth quarter year-over-year increases in seasonal business. Storage Solutions rental revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 9.8%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, when adjusted for the impact of currency fluctuations.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $0.7 million, or 0.8%, for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016. Decreased year-over-year rental revenue in the first nine months of 2017 was largely offset by increased year-over-year rental revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017. Rental revenues for the first nine months of 2017 decreased $3.9 million, or 5.5%, when compared to the same period in 2016, due primarily to decreased demand from our downstream customers as well as fewer infrastructure projects in our pump business. Fourth quarter 2017 rental revenue for our Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $3.2 million, or 14.2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the resumption of previously deferred maintenance in our downstream market, increased demand overall and new business.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $5.4 million, or 25.1%, to $27.0 million, compared to $21.6 million in 2016. The growth was largely due to increased activity in the U.K. resulting from an acquisition in late 2016. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.5 million to $5.4 million, compared to $4.9 million in 2016.\nCosts and Expenses.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $336.4 million increased $27.1 million, or 8.8%, as compared to 2016. Of this total increase, $22.5 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $4.7 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 63.1% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which was up from 60.8% in 2016.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business, rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $22.5 million, or 9.2%, from 2016. Included in Storage Solutions rental, selling and general expenses for 2017 and 2016 were $2.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, of expenses that were not indicative of our operations, primarily costs associated with the severance and transition of executive officers.\nExcluding the expenses discussed above, rental, selling and general expenses within the Storage Solutions business increased $20.7 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the 2016 period. When further adjusted for the effect of the change in currency translation rates, rental selling and general expenses for the Storage Solutions business increased $23.3 million. This increase was driven largely by higher variable compensation in 2017, as compared to 2016. In addition, transportation costs and payroll increased due to increased rental activity.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $4.7 million in 2017, as compared to 2016. The increase was largely due to increased payroll and variable compensation.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $17.9 million and $13.3 million in the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.1 million and $8.3 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales profit margin was 33.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 38.3% in 2016. The decrease in profit margin is due to sales activity related to a U.K. acquisition in late 2016.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.1 million and $3.2 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.4 million and $1.8 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The restructuring expenses in 2017 and 2016 resulted primarily from the continuation of projects initiated in prior years. Included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were approximately $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, of expenses related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary, ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure. Also included in restructuring expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $0.9 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expenses in both years relate largely to divisional and corporate departmental restructurings.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $63.4 million decreased slightly in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $3.0 million to $35.7 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $32.7 million in 2016. The 9.2% increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on the line of credit, partially offset by a decrease in the effective interest rate on our bonds due to the issuance of the 2024 Notes and extinguishment of the $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7.875% senior notes due December 1, 2020 (the 2020 Notes\u201d and together with the 2024 Notes, the Senior Notes\u201d) in the second quarter of 2016.\nOur average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $934.5 million, as compared to $929.1 million in 2016. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 3.6% and 3.3% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs. Taking into account the amortization of deferred financing costs, the weighted average interest rate was 3.8% and 3.5% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDebt Extinguishment Expense and Deferred Financing Costs Write-off. As a result of the redemption of the 2020 Notes in 2016, we recognized $9.2 million in debt extinguishment expense, consisting of $7.9 million in debt redemption premiums and $1.3 million in contractually required interest above the amount payable prior to the redemption. Additionally, we wrote off $2.3 million of previously deferred financing costs associated with the 2020 Notes that had not yet been amortized.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (64.9%) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily impacted by the accounting for the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, which reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company recognized a net benefit of $77.6 million related to the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities for this rate change, affecting the rate by (104.7%). Additionally, the Company recorded a provisional expense of $3.1 million for the mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings, affecting the rate by 4.2%. Excluding the effects of tax reform, our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 35.6%.\nThe increase to 35.6% from the effective tax rate of 31.4% for 2016 is due to an enacted U.K. rate change in 2016, reducing the rate applied to deferred tax balances from 18% to 17%, which resulted in a $0.9 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, changes in foreign rate differentials contributed to the overall effective tax rate increase. The change in foreign rate differentials was caused by the utilization of all remaining U.K. net operating losses during 2017, resulting in higher tax rates on our current year U.K. income.\nNet Income. As a result of the income statement activity discussed above, we had net income of $122.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the effect of the tax legislation, we estimate our net income would have been approximately $47.7 million, as compared to $47.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017, we realized adjusted EBITDA of $184.8 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 2.9%, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $190.4 million in 2016. Growth in our Storage Solutions business revenue was offset by a decrease in the Tank & Pump Solutions business, overall increased rental, selling and general costs primarily driven by increased variable compensation in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 and an unfavorable currency exchange rate. Our adjusted EBITDA margins were 34.6% and 37.4% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, adjusted EBITDA related to the Storage Solutions business decreased $1.0 million, or 0.6%, to $158.0 million, from $159.0 million in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business decreased $4.5 million, or 14.5%, to $26.8 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, from $31.4 million during 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were 36.3% for the Storage Solutions business and 27.4% for the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nThe full-year adjusted EBITDA was favorably impacted by a strong fourth quarter in which we realized adjusted EBITDA of $55.6 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 2.7%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue growth due to increased Tank & Pump Solutions business, and robust growth in our seasonal Storage Solutions revenues, while largely offset by increased variable compensation and other rental, selling and general expense increases, resulted in overall adjusted EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nRenting is a capital-intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues, cash flow and earnings. The majority of the assets that we rent have very long useful lives and require relatively little maintenance expenditures. Most of the capital we have deployed in our rental business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically, to execute opportunistic acquisitions, to increase the number of units available for rent at our existing locations, and to add to the mix of products we offer. During recent years, our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre-tax earnings, particularly due to cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings. Our cash from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 of $160.1 million, $135.6 million and $136.2 million, respectively, resulted in free cash flow of $72.9 million, $65.6 million and $64.7 million, respectively. In addition to free cash flow, our principal current source of liquidity is the Credit Agreement described below.\nRevolving Credit Facility. On December 14, 2015, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, $1.0 billion first lien senior secured revolving credit facility maturing on or before the earlier of (i) December 14, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the final maturity date of the Senior Notes if such Senior Notes remain outstanding on such date. The Credit Agreement also provides for the issuance of irrevocable standby letters of credit by U.S. lenders in amounts totaling up to $50.0 million, by U.K.-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million, and by Canadian-based lenders in amounts totaling up to $20.0 million.\nThe obligations of us and our subsidiary guarantors under the Credit Agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets. At December 31, 2018, we had $593.5 million of borrowings outstanding and $403.4 million of additional borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement. We were in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018 and were above the minimum borrowing availability threshold and therefore not subject to any financial maintenance covenants.\nAmounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed. Outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement bear interest at our option at either: (i) the London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin ( LIBOR Loans\u201d), or (ii) the prime rate plus an applicable margin ( Base Rate Loans\u201d). The applicable margin for each type of loan is based on an availability-based pricing grid and ranges from 1.25% to 1.75% for LIBOR Loans and 0.25% to 0.75% for Base Rate Loans at each measurement date. The margins in effect as of December 31, 2018 are 1.50% for LIBOR Loans and 0.50% for Base Rate Loans.\nAvailability of borrowings under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable, eligible rental fleet (including units held for sale, work-in-process and raw materials) and machinery and equipment, each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit. The rental fleet is appraised at least once annually by a third-party appraisal firm and up to 90% of the net orderly liquidation value, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is included in the borrowing base to determine how much we may borrow under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for U.K. borrowings, which are, at our option, denominated in either British pounds or Euros, by our U.K. subsidiary based upon a U.K. borrowing base; Canadian borrowings, which are denominated in Canadian dollars, by our Canadian subsidiary based upon a Canadian borrowing base; and U.S. borrowings, which are denominated in U.S. dollars, based upon a U.S. borrowing base along with any Canadian assets not included in the Canadian subsidiary.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: (i) allow certain liens to attach to Mobile Mini or subsidiary assets, (ii) repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities, or prepay certain indebtedness, (iii) incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions, and (iv) make acquisitions or other investments. In addition, we must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each quarter, upon the minimum availability amount under the Credit Agreement falling below the greater of (y) $90 million and (z) 10% of the lesser of the then total revolving loan commitment and aggregate borrowing base.\nWe believe our cash provided by operating activities will provide for our normal capital needs for the next twelve months. If not, we have sufficient borrowings available under our Credit Agreement to meet any additional funding requirements. We monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an ongoing basis using publicly-available information. Based upon that information, we do not presently believe that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders will be unable to honor their respective commitments under the Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes. On May 9, 2016, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes at an initial offering price of 100% of their face value. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Notes were used to (i) redeem all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 103.938% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date of June 8, 2016, (ii) repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the 2024 Notes.\nThe 2024 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per year, accruing from May 9, 2016, have an eight-year term and mature on July 1, 2024. Interest on the 2024 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, beginning on January 1, 2017. The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries.\nCash Flow Summary\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,062\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments to reconcile net (loss) income to net cash provided by\noperating activities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt extinguishment expense and deferred financing costs write-off\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,523\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,980\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments to reconcile net (loss) income to net cash\nprovided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in certain assets and liabilities, net of effect of businesses\nacquired\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,422\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,459\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19,077\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 160,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 135,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (77,063\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,006\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88,153\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (92,144\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (44,853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (714\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,846\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,524\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $160.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, compared to $135.6 million in the prior year, an increase of $24.5 million. The twelve months ended December 31, 2018 reflects a net loss of $8.1 million compared to net income of $122.2 million in 2017; however, non-cash adjustments in 2018 total $176.6 million and include a $102.1 million non-cash expense resulting from an asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture. These non-cash adjustments in 2018 resulted in a net increase to cash provided by operating activities. Net non-cash adjustments in 2017 were $22.9 million. Within non-cash adjustments, deferred taxes was $2.5 million in 2018 and $50.0 million in 2017. For further discussion, see Note 8 Income Taxes\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The change in working capital accounts resulted in cash outflows of $8.4 million in 2018 and $9.5 million in 2017 and was due to normal operating fluctuations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $135.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $136.2 million in the prior year, a slight decrease. The twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflects an increase in net income of $75.0 million. Non-cash adjustments in 2017 total $22.9 million as compared to $108.1 million in 2016. This fluctuation is primarily a result of the Tax Act enacted in 2017 and debt extinguishment costs in 2016. The change in working capital accounts resulted in cash outflows of $9.5 million in 2017 and $19.1 million in 2016. The $8.9 million decrease in cash outflows is largely due to increases in accounts receivable during 2016 due to the implementation of our new ERP system, as well as changes in the invoicing process instituted by our largest Storage Solutions customer.\nCash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2018, we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $150.5 million and a net deferred tax liability of $170.1 million.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $77.1 million in 2018, compared to $70.0 million in 2017 and $88.2 million in 2016. In 2018, investing activities included $10.2 million of proceeds related to assets that were designated as held for sale and in 2016, we paid $16.6 million, for acquisitions. Otherwise, net cash used in investing activities consists of net expenditures for rental fleet and property, plant and equipment.\nRental fleet expenditures were as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Additions to Rental Fleet, Excluding Acquisitions\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> North America Storage Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United Kingdom Storage Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tank & Pump Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated additions to rental fleet, excluding acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sale of rental fleet\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,993\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,953\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,679\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rental fleet net capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRental fleet expenditures were $86.0 million in 2018, an increase of $22.3 million compared to 2017. Rental fleet expenditures in 2018 were made to meet overall increases in Tank & Pump Solutions demand as well as for Storage Solutions demand in geographic areas of high utilization, as well as to meet customer demand for specific types of units. Compared to 2016, rental fleet expenditures increased 11.0% in 2017. Proceeds from sale of rental fleet units were consistent over the past three years. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location; as such, the proceeds from sale of rental units will normally fluctuate from year to year.\nProperty, plant and equipment net capital expenditures were $16.2 million in 2018, $19.3 million in 2017 and $27.9 million in 2016. These expenditures primarily related to internal software development, leasehold improvements and replacements for our transportation equipment.\nThe amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management's discretion. In addition to our expenditures for our rental fleet, capital expenditures include items such as the cost to buy or replace forklifts, trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers, and for our computer information and communication systems. In addition to the cash expenditures, we acquired property, plant and equipment through capital leases totaling $20.3 million, $9.5 million and $19.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These leases were primarily for transportation related equipment.\nWe anticipate our near term investing activities in 2019 will be between $75 million and $80 million and will be primarily focused on obtaining fleet to support growth in our North America Storage Solutions and Tank & Pump Solutions businesses. In addition, we may invest in acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $92.1 million in 2018, $57.0 million in 2017 and $44.9 million in 2016. Activity in 2016 includes the issuance of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes at an initial offering price of 100% of their face value. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2024 Notes were used to (i) redeem all $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 2020 Notes at a redemption price of 103.938% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date of June 8, 2016, (ii) repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and (iii) pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the 2024 Notes.\nWe have used free cash flow to purchase treasury stock, pay down borrowings and pay dividends. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we paid cash dividends of $44.5 million, $40.2 million and $36.4 million, respectively, to our stockholders and purchased shares of our common stock of $0.7 million, $8.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 we have $70.8 million remaining to repurchase treasury shares under the repurchase program. Borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2018, totaled $593.5 million and approximately $403.4 million of additional borrowings were available to us. Deferred financing cost expenditures in 2016 largely relate to the issuance of the 2024 Notes.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes and obligations under capital leases. We also have operating lease commitments for: (i) real estate properties for the majority of our locations with remaining lease terms typically ranging from one to ten years, (ii) delivery, transportation and yard equipment, typically under a five-year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price, and (iii) office related equipment. At December 31, 2018, primarily in connection with securing our insurance policies, we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately $3.1 million in letters of credit.\nThe table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of December 31, 2018. Lease renewal options that we currently anticipate exercising at the end of the initial lease period have been included in the schedule below.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 593,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 593,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payment obligations under our revolving credit\nfacility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payment obligations under our Senior Notes (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Obligations under capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payment obligations under our capital leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,419\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,834\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,179,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 724,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 301,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Scheduled interest rate obligations under our Credit Agreement, which is subject to a variable rate of interest, were calculated using our weighted average rate as of December 31, 2018 of 3.9%.

Construction customers typically reflect higher demand during months with more temperate weather, while demand for our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from September through December because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season. Our retail customers usually return these rented units to us in December and early in the following year. In the Tank & Pump Solutions business, demand from customers is typically higher in the middle of the year from March to October, driven by the timing of\ncustomer maintenance projects. The demand for rental of our pumps may also be impacted by weather, specifically when temperatures drop below freezing.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Judgments\nOur significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, some of which require significant judgment.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based upon expert information, our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events, and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available. We have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying estimates or assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRental contracts with our customers may have multiple performance obligations including the direct rental of fleet to our customers, fleet delivery and pickup. Also included in rental revenues are ancillary fees, including late charges and charges for damages. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using the contractually stated price as our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct promise in the contract. Our prices are determined using methods and assumptions developed consistently across similar customers and markets.\nWe enter into contracts with our customers to rent equipment generally based on a 28-day rate for our Storage Solutions fleet and a daily, weekly or monthly rate for our Tank & Pump Solutions fleet. Revenues from renting are recognized ratably over the rental period under lessor accounting. The rental continues until cancelled by the customer or the Company. If equipment is returned prior to the end of the contractually obligated period, the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date, is recognized as incremental revenue upon return. Customers may utilize our equipment delivery and pick-up services in conjunction with the rental of equipment, but it is not required. Revenue pursuant to the delivery or pick up of a rented unit is recognized in rental revenue upon completion of the service.\nSales revenue is primarily generated by the sale of new and used units, and to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to Tank & Pump Solutions customers. Sales contracts generally have a single performance obligation that is satisfied at the time of delivery. Sales revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract and recognized when the customer takes possession of the unit or other sale items.\nPurchase Accounting. We account for acquisitions under the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method of accounting, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair market value on the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is provisional and could change as additional information is received. We finalize valuations as soon as practicable, but not later than one-year from the acquisition date. Any subsequent changes to purchase price allocations result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nThe determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value; and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if amortizable, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. We estimate the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition.\nGoodwill. For acquired businesses, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Of the $705.2 million total goodwill at December 31, 2018, $468.4 million related to the North American Storage Solutions segment, $55.6 million related to the U.K. Storage Solutions segment and $181.2 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions segment.\nGoodwill impairment testing requires judgment, including: the identification of the reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; the assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to each reporting unit; estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and discount rates; and an assumption regarding the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant. Management assesses potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis at December 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nSome factors management considers important which could require an impairment review include the following:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant under-performance relative to historical, expected or projected future operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> market capitalization relative to net book value; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> significant negative industry or general economic trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement may choose to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more-likely-than-not that goodwill might be impaired and whether or not to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. When the two-step impairment test is performed, the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting unit's net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's net assets is less than its fair value, no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit's net assets is higher than its fair value, there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed. If the second step is necessary, management is required to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill. The fair value of the reporting units would be assigned to the respective assets and liabilities of each reporting unit as if the reporting units had been acquired in separate and individual business combinations and the fair value of the reporting units was the price paid to acquire the reporting units. The excess of the fair value of the reporting units over the amounts assigned to their respective assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss must be recognized for the difference.\nWhen assessing the fair value of the reporting units under the two-step impairment test, management considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimated future revenue growth rates and discount rates. Other estimates relate to tax payments, operating margins and capital expenditures. Each approach is given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we assessed qualitative factors and determined it is more-likely-than-not each of the reporting unit's assigned goodwill had estimated fair values greater than the respective reporting unit's individual net asset carrying values; therefore, the two-step impairment test was not performed.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets (Other than Goodwill). Our rental fleet, property, plant and equipment, and finite-lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. (See potential impairment indicators under Goodwill\u201d above.) If this review indicates the carrying value of these assets will not be recoverable, as measured based on estimated undiscounted cash flows over their remaining life, the carrying amount would be adjusted to fair value. The cash flow estimates contain management's best estimates using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time of evaluation.\nRental Fleet. Rental fleet is capitalized at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the unit using the straight-line method. Rental fleet is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent. Capitalized cost of our rental fleet includes the price paid to acquire the unit and freight charges to the location when the unit is first placed in service, and when applicable, the cost of our manufacturing or remanufacturing, which includes the cost of customizing units. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred.\nWe periodically review depreciable lives and residual values against various factors, including the results of our lenders' independent appraisal of our rental fleet, practices of our competitors in comparable industries and profit margins achieved on sales of depreciated units.\nThe table below depicts the estimated useful lives and residual values (presented as a percentage of capitalized cost) for our major categories of Storage Solutions rental fleet.\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Residual\nValue as\nPercentage of\nOriginal Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Useful Life\nin Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Storage Solutions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel storage containers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel ground level offices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below depicts the estimated useful lives for our major categories of Tank & Pump Solutions rental fleet when purchased new. We estimate zero residual value for our Tank & Pump Solutions fleet as there is a limited secondary market for Tank & Pump Solutions products.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Useful Life\nin Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tank & Pump Solutions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Steel tanks\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Roll-off boxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15 - 20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vacuum boxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stainless steel tank trailers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> De-watering boxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pumps and filtration equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe estimated useful lives and residual values of our rental fleet might change in the future based on changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets. For instance, if all our rental fleet units had been placed in service with useful lives 25% less or greater than our current estimated useful lives, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been $10.5 million higher or $6.3 million lower, respectively.\nSimilarly, if our rental fleet units had been placed in service with estimated residual values decreased by 10% of the original cost, for example from 55% to 45% (with Tank & Pump Solutions residual values remaining at 0%), depreciation expense would have been approximately $3.3 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2018. If our rental fleet units had been placed in service with estimated residual values increased by 10% of the original cost, for example, from 55% to 65% for steel storage containers and from 0% to 10% for Tank & Pump Solutions, our depreciation expense would have been lower by approximately $5.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. For each jurisdiction, we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nA valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more-likely-than-not that the related benefits will not be realized. In determining the amount of the valuation allowance, we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction. If we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense. Conversely, if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided, all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense.\nThe majority of our deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates. Management believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations, or through available tax planning strategies to recover the unreserved portion of these assets. However, given that the federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over six years beginning in 2029, there could be changes in management's judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets.\nTax regulations within the various jurisdictions within which we operate are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. Our income taxes are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income.\nWe have recorded certain income tax effects for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) which was enacted on December 22, 2017. Previously issued guidance provided for a one year period from the enactment date to allow the Company to complete its analysis of the Tax Act. The Company has completed its analysis and recorded any final effects within this one year period.\nThe Tax Act enacted a new a minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign operations called Global Intangible Low Tax Income ( GILTI\u201d). The Company has made a policy election to account for any impacts of GILTI tax in the period in which it is incurred.\nSee additional information regarding income taxes in Note 8 Income Taxes\u201d to the accompanying financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor discussions of the adoption and potential impacts of recently issued accounting standards, refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "In the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the annual report, the company reports its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2018.

discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d The tables and information in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d ( MD&A\u201d) section were derived from exact numbers and may have immaterial rounding differences.\nOverview\nExecutive Summary\nThroughout 2018, our continuing operational strategic goals included growing revenue and expanding our operating margins by leveraging our infrastructure, focusing on higher returning assets and driving continuous improvements in efficiency. To achieve these goals, we concentrated on generating growth in our core rental business through strong organic growth. We also leveraged our new ERP system functionality and other technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies, including mobile applications for both our employees and our customers and processes around the management of fleet.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our network includes 117 Storage Solutions locations, 20 Tank & Pump locations and 17 combined locations. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 195,600 units and our Tank & Pump Solutions business has a fleet of approximately 12,600 units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our achievements included:\n \u2022 Grew total rental revenues 11.9% year-over-year \n \u2022 Within our Storage Solutions business, which represented approximately 80% of rental revenue in 2018: \n - Grew total rental revenues 10.1% year-over-year, \n - Increased year-over-year Storage Solutions rental rates by 2.4%, and \n - Increased average units on rent by 3.5%, \n \u2022 Successfully positioned our Tank & Pump Solutions business to take advantage of positive trends in our underlying markets, which resulted in: \n - Year-over-year rental revenue growth of 20.1%, \n - Increased average equipment on rent (based on original equipment cost) by 20.8% year-over-year, with sequential increases in each quarter, and \n - Year-over-year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent, \n \u2022 Generated adjusted EBITDA of $217.2 million, with a 36.6% margin, \n \u2022 Implemented digital and mobile solutions across our businesses to drive market share, especially with large customers that value this deepened technology, and \n \u2022 Generated $72.9 million in free cash flow and returned $44.5 million to shareholders through dividends. \n \u2022 Decreased leverage ratio to 4.2x as of December 31, 2018, from 5.0x as of December 31, 2017 (leverage ratio calculated by dividing debt, less cash, by adjusted EBITDA). \nAsset Impairment Charge and Loss on Divestiture, Net of Proceeds\nConsistent with our strategy to focus on high returning assets, during the second quarter of 2018 we initiated an organization-wide project to assess the economic and operational status of our fleet and other assets as well as an in-depth analysis of our fleet management process to identify inefficiencies. The result of this review was the identification of specific assets over which a further determination as to the economics of continued retention and repair could be made. In July 2018, management presented a proposed plan of sale for certain identified assets to the Board of Directors, and on July 24, the Board of Directors made the strategic decision to approve the plan and authorized management to begin actively marketing the assets for sale. As a result, we classified these assets, which were primarily rental fleet, as held for sale and recognized a loss of $102.1 million in 2018. We also identified and placed as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and inventory that were not being used efficiently. The assets represent a subset of larger asset groups held by the Company. As of December 31, 2018, the sale was completed.\nBecause the majority of these units were not producing revenue we do not anticipate the disposal of these assets to have any impact on our ability to generate revenue or to meet customer demand, nor do we expect a material impact on our liquidity or free cash flow, including planned capital expenditures. Overall, between the disposal of fleet and our strengthened processes, we expect operating expense savings of approximately $5 million to $7 million annually. The savings includes reductions in labor, repairs and maintenance and lease costs. In 2018 we realized savings of approximately $2 million related to the fleet divestiture and new strengthened processes around fleet management. We expect to implement all costs savings measures by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In addition, as a result of the reduction to our fleet and property, plant and equipment we expect depreciation expense to decrease approximately $0.9 million per quarter.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $77.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company finalized its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act passed in December 2017 and in the current year recorded a reduction of $2.6 million to provisional amounts that were recorded in the prior year.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nApproximately 66% of our rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 was derived from our North American Storage Solutions business, 20% was derived from our Tank & Pump Solutions business in North America and 14% was derived from our U.K. Storage Solutions business. Our business is subject to the general health of the economy and we utilize a variety of general economic indicators to assess market trends and determine the direction of our business. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union (the E.U.\u201d) in a referendum vote, which may have currently unknown social, geopolitical and economic impacts. The withdrawal negotiations began in 2017, and are still continuing. The date of the U.K.'s departure from the E.U. is set for March 29, 2019. As developments and their impact become clearer, we may adjust our strategy and operations accordingly.\nBased on our current forecasts and assessment, we expect that the majority of our end markets will continue to drive demand for our products. In particular, construction, which represents approximately 36% of our consolidated rental revenue, is forecasted for continued growth in absolute terms but the rate of growth is expected to slow as compared to 2018. Economic indicators related to our industrial and commercial end-segment are also favorable with positive trends in production and capacity utilization. Industrial and commercial customers, which comprise approximately 25% of our rental revenue, generally operate in industries such as: large processing plants for organic and inorganic chemicals, refineries, distributors and trucking and utility companies. Our national retail accounts typically involve seasonal demand in the third and fourth quarter during the holiday season. Retail and consumer service customers comprise approximately 25% of our revenue and include department, drug, grocery and strip mall stores as well as hotels, restaurants, service stations and dry cleaners.\nAccounting and Operating Overview\nOur principal operating revenues and expenses are:\nRevenues:\n \u2022 Rental revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our rental fleet. \n \u2022 Sales revenues consist primarily of sales of new and used fleet and, to a lesser extent, parts and supplies sold to customers. \nCosts and Expenses:\n \u2022 Rental, selling and general expenses include, among other expenses, payroll and payroll-related costs (including share-based compensation and commissions for our sales team), fleet transportation and fuel costs, repair and maintenance costs for our rental fleet and transportation equipment, real estate lease expense, insurance costs, and general corporate expenses. \n \u2022 Cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations includes the net book value of the units that were sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy, transport, remanufacture and modify used containers and our cost to manufacture Storage Solutions units and other structures, and to a lesser extent the costs of parts and supplies sold to customers. \n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on our rental fleet, our property, plant and equipment, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets. \nIn addition to focusing on GAAP measurements, we focus on EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow to measure our operating results. As such, we include in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also evaluate our operations on a constant currency basis. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated our statements of operations data and expresses revenue and expense data as percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\n\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nThe following table sets forth certain financial information as calculated on a constant currency basis:\n\n (1) See Non-GAAP Data and Reconciliations\u201d earlier in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nTotal Revenues. The following tables depict revenue by type of business for the twelve-month periods ended December 31:\n\n\nOf the $593.2 million of total revenues in 2018, $477.0 million, or 80.4%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $116.2 million, or 19.6%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. In the prior year, $435.5 million, or 81.6%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 18.4%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $40.9 million, or 10.1%, as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 2.4% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 3.5% increase in units on rent as well as favorable mix and increases in delivery and pickup revenue. Yield (calculated as rental revenues divided by average units on rent) increased approximately 6.3% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by increased rates, favorable mix and increased delivery and pickup revenue. Beginning in the second half of 2017, we successfully leveraged our technology, footprint and fleet capacity to partner with our National Account customers, which continued to drive year-over-year growth in 2018, especially in the first half of 2018. During 2018 we began to pursue partnerships with other rental companies to provide supplementary product offerings for certain of our Storage Solutions\ncustomers. Arranging these comprehensive rental services for our customers increases loyalty while generating additional rental revenue, without additional investment in fleet. While these revenues were not material for the fourth quarter or the full year of 2018, we do expect to continue to develop these revenues.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $18.5 million, or 20.1%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by an approximately 20.8% increase in fleet on rent for the current year. Overall, rates were challenged in the first half of 2018, however, we had year-over-year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent throughout the last six months of the year. Demand from our downstream customers increased overall and maintenance projects that were postponed throughout much of 2017 returned to normalized levels. We believe we are performing better than the market by leveraging our superior service and national footprint with our larger customers. Additionally, we experienced a year-over-year increase in upstream business due to increased activity in the oil and gas segment. Our salesforce has also successfully pursued new diversified customers in local geographies and we gained traction throughout 2018 on several new or extended customer contracts signed late in 2017 and early 2018.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location. Storage Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $2.0 million, or 7.6%, to $29.0 million, compared to $27.0 million in the prior-year period. Tank & Pump Solutions sales revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 decreased $0.1 million to $5.3 million, compared to $5.4 million in the prior-year period.\nCosts and Expenses. The following tables depict costs and expenses by type of business for the twelve-month periods ended December 31:\n\n\nRental, Selling and General Expenses. Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 of $364.1 million increased $27.7 million, or 8.2%, as compared to 2017. Of this total increase, $19.6 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $8.1 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 61.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which was down from 63.1% in 2017.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business rental, selling and general expenses in the prior-year period was $2.6 million of expense related to the severance and transition of an executive. Excluding this expense, rental, selling and general expenses increased $22.3 million, an 8.4% increase from the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher transportation, salary and re-rent costs required to support the additional rental activity as well as an increase in variable compensation in the\ncurrent year, as compared to the prior year. Also contributing to the year-over-year difference is increased stock-based compensation expense due to the anticipated achievement of certain goals related to our performance-based stock award plan.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $8.1 million, or 11.8%, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. The increase was largely due to increased transportation costs to support the additional rental activity as well as an increase in variable compensation in the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $19.4 million and $17.9 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.6 million and $9.1 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales profit expressed as a percentage of sales revenue (sales profit margin) was 33.0% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 33.6% in the prior-year period.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.0 million and $3.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.3 million and $2.4 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The $2.0 million of restructuring expenses recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, consisted primarily of expense related to the restructuring of our corporate service center, including the severance of an executive, and expense incurred in conjunction with the divestiture of certain assets as discussed earlier in this MD&A. Additionally in 2018, we recognized expenses related to projects initiated in prior years that were not accruable during such periods.\nOf the $2.9 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, approximately $1.3 million related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure and $0.9 million consisted of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expense related largely to division and corporate departmental restructurings.\nAsset impairment charge and loss on divestiture, net. As discussed in the overview section of this MD&A, during the current period we identified specific underperforming assets to classify as held for sale. As a result, we recognized a loss of $102.1 million in the year.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $67.0 million increased 5.7% in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017. The majority of this increase relates to depreciation on property, plant and equipment.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $40.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $35.7 million in the prior-year period. This 14.5% increase is due to a higher effective interest rate on our lines of credit, partially offset by an overall decrease in debt outstanding. Our average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $917.8 million, compared to $934.5 million in the prior year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 4.2% and 3.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs. Taking into account the amortization of deferred financing costs, the weighted average interest rate was 4.5% and 3.8% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (51.8%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by the $102.1 million asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture which resulted in a $5.3 million loss before income taxes. As a result of the low pre-tax loss, the permanent differences between actual income and taxable income are having a meaningful effect on the tax rate. The nondeductible items include $5.8 million in tax expense related to prior-period share-based compensation, offset by a $2.6 million reduction in our provisional tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings for the impact of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.\nExcluding the asset impairment charge and", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

To achieve these goals, we concentrated on generating growth in our core rental business through strong organic growth. We also leveraged our new ERP system functionality and other technology enhancements to drive additional efficiencies, including mobile applications for both our employees and our customers and processes around the management of fleet.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our network includes 117 Storage Solutions locations, 20 Tank & Pump locations and 17 combined locations. Our Storage Solutions fleet consists of approximately 195,600 units and our Tank & Pump Solutions business has a fleet of approximately 12,600 units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our achievements included:\n \u2022 Grew total rental revenues 11.9% year-over-year \n \u2022 Within our Storage Solutions business, which represented approximately 80% of rental revenue in 2018: \n - Grew total rental revenues 10.1% year-over-year, \n - Increased year-over-year Storage Solutions rental rates by 2.4%, and \n - Increased average units on rent by 3.5%, \n \u2022 Successfully positioned our Tank & Pump Solutions business to take advantage of positive trends in our underlying markets, which resulted in: \n - Year-over-year rental revenue growth of 20.1%, \n - Increased average equipment on rent (based on original equipment cost) by 20.8% year-over-year, with sequential increases in each quarter, and \n - Year-over-year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent, \n \u2022 Generated adjusted EBITDA of $217.2 million, with a 36.6% margin, \n \u2022 Implemented digital and mobile solutions across our businesses to drive market share, especially with large customers that value this deepened technology, and \n \u2022 Generated $72.9 million in free cash flow and returned $44.5 million to shareholders through dividends. \n \u2022 Decreased leverage ratio to 4.2x as of December 31, 2018, from 5.0x as of December 31, 2017 (leverage ratio calculated by dividing debt, less cash, by adjusted EBITDA). \nAsset Impairment Charge and Loss on Divestiture, Net of Proceeds\nConsistent with our strategy to focus on high returning assets, during the second quarter of 2018 we initiated an organization-wide project to assess the economic and operational status of our fleet and other assets as well as an in-depth analysis of our fleet management process to identify inefficiencies. The result of this review was the identification of specific assets over which a further determination as to the economics of continued retention and repair could be made. In July 2018, management presented a proposed plan of sale for certain identified assets to the Board of Directors, and on July 24, the Board of Directors made the strategic decision to approve the plan and authorized management to begin actively marketing the assets for sale.

We also identified and placed as held for sale, property, plant and equipment and inventory that were not being used efficiently. The assets represent a subset of larger asset groups held by the Company. As of December 31, 2018, the sale was completed.\nBecause the majority of these units were not producing revenue we do not anticipate the disposal of these assets to have any impact on our ability to generate revenue or to meet customer demand, nor do we expect a material impact on our liquidity or free cash flow, including planned capital expenditures. Overall, between the disposal of fleet and our strengthened processes, we expect operating expense savings of approximately $5 million to $7 million annually. The savings includes reductions in labor, repairs and maintenance and lease costs. In 2018 we realized savings of approximately $2 million related to the fleet divestiture and new strengthened processes around fleet management. We expect to implement all costs savings measures by the end of the first quarter of 2019. In addition, as a result of the reduction to our fleet and property, plant and equipment we expect depreciation expense to decrease approximately $0.9 million per quarter.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), which, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and requires mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net tax benefit of $77.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we recorded a provisional income tax expense of $3.1 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company finalized its analysis of the impact of the Tax Act passed in December 2017 and in the current year recorded a reduction of $2.6 million to provisional amounts that were recorded in the prior year.\nBusiness Environment and Outlook\nApproximately 66% of our rental revenue during the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018 was derived from our North American Storage Solutions business, 20% was derived from our Tank & Pump Solutions business in North America and 14% was derived from our U.K. Storage Solutions business.

In the prior year, $435.5 million, or 81.6%, related to the Storage Solutions business and $98.1 million, or 18.4%, related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business.\nRental Revenues. Storage Solutions rental revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 increased $40.9 million, or 10.1%, as compared to the prior-year period. The increase was driven by a 2.4% increase in year-over-year rental rates and a 3.5% increase in units on rent as well as favorable mix and increases in delivery and pickup revenue. Yield (calculated as rental revenues divided by average units on rent) increased approximately 6.3% as compared to the prior-year period, driven by increased rates, favorable mix and increased delivery and pickup revenue. Beginning in the second half of 2017, we successfully leveraged our technology, footprint and fleet capacity to partner with our National Account customers, which continued to drive year-over-year growth in 2018, especially in the first half of 2018. During 2018 we began to pursue partnerships with other rental companies to provide supplementary product offerings for certain of our Storage Solutions\ncustomers. Arranging these comprehensive rental services for our customers increases loyalty while generating additional rental revenue, without additional investment in fleet. While these revenues were not material for the fourth quarter or the full year of 2018, we do expect to continue to develop these revenues.\nRental revenues within the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $18.5 million, or 20.1%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year period. The increase was driven by an approximately 20.8% increase in fleet on rent for the current year. Overall, rates were challenged in the first half of 2018, however, we had year-over-year rate increases for new equipment placed on rent throughout the last six months of the year. Demand from our downstream customers increased overall and maintenance projects that were postponed throughout much of 2017 returned to normalized levels. We believe we are performing better than the market by leveraging our superior service and national footprint with our larger customers. Additionally, we experienced a year-over-year increase in upstream business due to increased activity in the oil and gas segment. Our salesforce has also successfully pursued new diversified customers in local geographies and we gained traction throughout 2018 on several new or extended customer contracts signed late in 2017 and early 2018.\nSales Revenues. We focus on rental revenues. In general, sales of units from our fleet occur due to a particular customer need, or due to having fleet in excess of demand at a particular location.

Rental, selling and general expenses for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 of $364.1 million increased $27.7 million, or 8.2%, as compared to 2017. Of this total increase, $19.6 million related to the Storage Solutions business and $8.1 million related to the Tank & Pump Solutions business. As a percentage of total revenues, rental, selling and general expenses were 61.4% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which was down from 63.1% in 2017.\nWithin the Storage Solutions business rental, selling and general expenses in the prior-year period was $2.6 million of expense related to the severance and transition of an executive. Excluding this expense, rental, selling and general expenses increased $22.3 million, an 8.4% increase from the prior-year period. The increase was primarily due to higher transportation, salary and re-rent costs required to support the additional rental activity as well as an increase in variable compensation in the\ncurrent year, as compared to the prior year. Also contributing to the year-over-year difference is increased stock-based compensation expense due to the anticipated achievement of certain goals related to our performance-based stock award plan.\nRental, selling and general expenses for the Tank & Pump Solutions business increased $8.1 million, or 11.8%, in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. The increase was largely due to increased transportation costs to support the additional rental activity as well as an increase in variable compensation in the current year, as compared to the prior year.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales is the cost related to our sales revenue only. Within the Storage Solutions business, cost of sales was $19.4 million and $17.9 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Storage Solutions sales profit was $9.6 million and $9.1 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales profit expressed as a percentage of sales revenue (sales profit margin) was 33.0% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 33.6% in the prior-year period.\nWithin the Tank & Pump Solutions business, cost of sales was $3.0 million and $3.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tank & Pump Solutions sales profit was $2.3 million and $2.4 million for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses. The $2.0 million of restructuring expenses recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, consisted primarily of expense related to the restructuring of our corporate service center, including the severance of an executive, and expense incurred in conjunction with the divestiture of certain assets as discussed earlier in this MD&A. Additionally in 2018, we recognized expenses related to projects initiated in prior years that were not accruable during such periods.\nOf the $2.9 million of restructuring expense recognized in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, approximately $1.3 million related to the integration of our wholly owned subsidiary ETS into the existing Mobile Mini infrastructure and $0.9 million consisted of costs related to the divestiture of our wood mobile office business, primarily related to the abandonment of yards, or portions of yards. The remaining restructuring expense related largely to division and corporate departmental restructurings.\nAsset impairment charge and loss on divestiture, net. As discussed in the overview section of this MD&A, during the current period we identified specific underperforming assets to classify as held for sale. As a result, we recognized a loss of $102.1 million in the year.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization expense of $67.0 million increased 5.7% in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017. The majority of this increase relates to depreciation on property, plant and equipment.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $40.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $35.7 million in the prior-year period. This 14.5% increase is due to a higher effective interest rate on our lines of credit, partially offset by an overall decrease in debt outstanding. Our average debt outstanding in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 was $917.8 million, compared to $934.5 million in the prior year period. The weighted average interest rate on our debt was 4.2% and 3.6% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, excluding the amortization of deferred financing costs. Taking into account the amortization of deferred financing costs, the weighted average interest rate was 4.5% and 3.8% for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax (benefit) rate of (51.8%) for the year ended December 31, 2018 was impacted by the $102.1 million asset impairment charge and loss on divestiture which resulted in a $5.3 million loss before income taxes. As a result of the low pre-tax loss, the permanent differences between actual income and taxable income are having a meaningful effect on the tax rate. The nondeductible items include $5.8 million in tax expense related to prior-period share-based compensation, offset by a $2.6 million reduction in our provisional tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign earnings for the impact of the Tax Act enacted in December 2017.\nExcluding the asset impairment charge and"}
