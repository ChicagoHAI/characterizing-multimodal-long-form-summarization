The data\nbelow presents the business' growth in key areas for\nthe past five years and the related compound annual growth rate ( CAGR\u201d):\n2017 to 2021\nAs of December 31,\nCAGR\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n%\n$\n745,969\n$\n654,588\n$\n739,473\n$\n661,628\n$\n701,534\nGross loans (net of unearned income)\n(1)\n4,256,213\n4,441,897\n3,852,244\n3,060,747\n1,996,029\nTotal assets\n5,621,457\n5,659,303\n4,931,233\n4,107,215\n2,961,118\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n1,163,224\n718,459\n521,826\n484,284\n290,906\nTotal deposits\n%\n$\n4,683,597\n$\n4,694,740\n$\n3,923,759\n$\n3,208,097\n$\n2,303,364\n(1)\nIncludes $65 million and $292 million of PPP loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur Strategy\nOur strategy has been to build the most trusted bank in our markets, which we believe\ndrives value for our stockholders. We are\ncommitted to a culture of serving our clients in extraordinary ways by providing\npersonalized, relationship-based banking. We believe that\nsuccess is achieved through establishing and growing the trust of our\nclients, employees, stakeholders, and communities.\nDuring 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to serve our\ncustomers by providing PPP loan funding, modifying loans through\npayment deferrals and rate adjustments, and using our\ntechnology to reduce contact exposure. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2021, we remain focused on growth and building stockholder value\nthrough greater efficiency and increased profitability. We intend to\nexecute our strategic plan through the following:\n\u2022\nContinue organic growth;\n\u2022\nSelectively pursue opportunities to expand through acquisitions or\nnew market development;\n\u2022\nAttract and develop talent;\n\u2022\nImprove financial performance;\n\u2022\nMaintain a branch-lite business model with strategically placed locations; and\n\u2022\nLeverage technology to enhance the client experience and improve profitability.\nPerformance Measures\nAs of or for the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nReturn on average assets\n1.24\n%\n0.24\n%\n0.63\n%\nReturn on average equity\n10.84\n%\n2.05\n%\n5.38\n%\nEarnings per share\n(1)\n$\n1.35\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.59\nDiluted earnings per share\n(1)\n$\n1.33\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.58\nEfficiency\n(2)\n54.50\n%\n58.13\n%\n58.37\n%\nEquity to assets\n11.88\n%\n11.03\n%\n12.20\n%\n(1)\nRetroactively adjusted per share figures to account for\na two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend, whereby each holder of\nour common stock received one additional share of common stock for each share owned as of the record date of December 19, 2018.\n(2)\nWe calculate efficiency ratio as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.\n2021 Highlights:\n\u25cf\nNet income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $69\nmillion, an increase of $57 million or 451% from the prior\nyear ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nTotal assets were $5.6 billion primarily made up of $4.3 billion in loans and\n$746 million in available-for-sale securities.\n\u25cf\nImproved our fiscal year efficiency ratio from 58.13% in 2020 to\n54.50% in 2021.\n\u25cf\nPurchased 1,530,357 or $22 million of outstanding shares as part of the share\nrepurchase programs in 2021.\n\u25cf\nExpanded into Phoenix, Arizona.\n\u25cf\nIncreased tangible book value per share to $13.23 at December 31, 2021\ncompared to $12.08 at December 31, 2020.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, economic\nuncertainty and a disruption to the financial markets, the\nduration and extent of which is not currently known. A discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its\noperations and measures undertaken by the Company in response thereto is provided\nbelow.\nBank Operations\nThe Company has a business continuity plan to mitigate operational risks in unusual,\nunexpected events. The plan identifies key\ncomponents of our operations and creates responses to ensure normal operations\ncontinue and to minimize the effects of potential loss. We\nimplemented the business continuity procedures in March 2020\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, substantially all\nemployees returned to on-premises work. In addition, a hybrid work\nopportunity was created for most employees. No material interruptions\nto our business operations have occurred to date.\nPaycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) Lending Facility\nThe PPP was established by the CARES Act and authorized forgivable loans to small businesses. The Consolidated Appropriations\nAct of 2021 allocated additional PPP funding. The Bank provided PPP loans to support current customers and foster relationships with new\ncustomers. The loans earned interest at 1%, included fees between 1% and 5% and typically matured\nin two or five years. The loans\noriginated under the PPP received a 0% risk weight under the regulatory capital rules which resulted\nin increased Common Equity Tier 1,\nTier 1, and Tier 2 capital ratios, but the PPP loans are included in the calculation of our Leverage ratio.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the PPP loans on our 2021 and 2020 financials:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPPP Loan Activity\nOutstanding loan balance, beginning\n$\n292,230\n$\n-\nLoan increases\n133,778\n369,260\nLoan payoffs\n(361,203)\n(77,030)\nOutstanding loan balance, end\n$\n64,805\n$\n292,230\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPPP Loan Fee Activity\nUnearned fee balance, beginning\n$\n4,189\n$\n-\nUnearned fees added\n5,062\n9,946\nEarned fees recognized\n(7,568)\n(5,757)\nUnearned fee balance, end\n$\n1,683\n$\n4,189\n\u2020 Earned fees include fees earned from loans forgiven and monthly amortization\nfees on loans outstanding.\nLoan Modifications\nThe CARES Act as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, allowed financial institutions to elect to suspend GAAP\nprinciples and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating\nto the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise require evaluation\nas troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d) from March 1, 2020 to January\n2, 2022 as long as the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of\nDecember 31, 2019. The Company elected to use this guidance and started the modified\nloan process during the first quarter of 2020. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company had 6 loans with an outstanding balance\nof $17 million that were still under these modified terms.\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) Implementation\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments.\u201d\nTopic 326 replaces the incurred loss model for determining the allowance\nfor credit losses ( ACL\u201d),\nformerly presented as the allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d).\nThe CECL approach requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses\nexpected to occur over the estimated remaining life of the asset. As a result, the new approach may accelerate the recording\nof credit losses\ncompared to the former, incurred loss model. The new standard does not change the\ncredit risk of the Company's loans or the ultimate losses\nincurred by the Company on those loans. Topic 326 may result in increased volatility in the Company's\nnet income and capital levels due to\nchanges in the reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic\nconditions on a quarterly basis.\nFor information regarding our implementation process, refer to\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company adopted Topic 326 through a modified retrospective approach\nthat results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained\nearnings as of the day of adoption. The Company anticipates the January 1, 2022 ACL to be between $55 million and $61 million compared\nto $58 million as of December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, CECL applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as unfunded lines of credit, financial\nguarantees not accounted\nfor as derivatives, and other unfunded loan commitments. The expected credit loss liability\nfor off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated\nover the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit\nrisk unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer.\nThe credit loss estimate for off-balance sheet credit exposure considers the\nlikelihood that funding will occur and if funded, the related\nestimate of expected credit losses. Changes in the estimated credit loss are reported\nin the statement of income and the expected credit loss\nestimate for unfunded commitments is reported as a liability on the balance\nsheet. Once a loan is funded, the expected credit loss for off-\nbalance sheet exposures will be transferred to the ACL.\nThe Company expects to record a $4 million to $8 million credit loss liability for\noff-balance sheet credit exposures. The credit loss\nliability will result in a decrease to retained earnings, net of the deferred tax\nasset.\nThe change in the required ACL is primarily a result of: (i) consolidation of previously disaggregated loan pools, (ii) an increase in\nthe\nlookback period, and (iii) incorporation of reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Under the incurred loss model, the Company disaggregated\nloans by risk ratings and loan categories. Under the CECL model, the Company's pools were reduced\nand did not sub-segment by risk rating.\nThe change in the Company's loan pools is expected to decrease the required\nreserve as of January 1, 2022. The incurred loss model's look-\nback period was short compared to the CECL methodology that requires the use of a full economic cycle. The change in the\nlook-back period\nis expected to decrease the required reserve. The application of forward-looking\nguidance is new under the CECL methodology. The\nCompany uses the unemployment rate guidance provided by the Federal\nReserve and reverts to an average unemployment rate outside of the\nforecast periods. The change in methodology does not materially impact the Company's loans\nthat were impaired as of December 31, 2021.\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable\nby the Company will be driven by: (i) The type of loan\ncommitment which are grouped using the same loan pools for the loan portfolio.\nFor example, the expected funding of residential\nconstruction loans is expected to be higher than funding for energy loans; (ii)\nchanges in historical loss rates; (iii) qualitative factors;\nand (iv)\naverage utilization rates.\nTopic 326 eliminates the other than temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) methodology\non available-for-sale securities. The OTTI method\nis replaced with an allowance and related credit loss expense. This allows subsequent increases in\nfair market value of the security to be\nrecognized by reducing the allowance and reversing previous credit loss expense\nrecorded. The Company's available-for-sale securities were\nnot materially impacted by Topic 326's implementation.\nWe anticipate the implementation of Topic 326 will not have a material impact on our capital ratios. The Federal\nReserve System, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency adopted a joint final rule for an optional phase-in\nperiod of three years for banks to absorb the impact to regulatory capital\nof implementing the new CECL standard. For the first year of the\ntransition, the Company may reduce the impact of CECL on retained earnings by 75%. For years two\nand three, the regulatory capital\nschedules would continue to be adjusted based on declining amount of 25% each\nyear.\nCustomer and Industry Concentrations\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's top 20 customer relationships, represented\napproximately 27% or $1.2 billion of total\ndeposits. The majority of the $1.2 billion are money market deposit accounts. The Company believes\nthat there are sufficient funding\nsources, including on-balance sheet liquid assets and wholesale deposit\noptions, so that an immediate reduction in these deposit balances\nwould not be expected to have a detrimental effect on the Company's financial\nposition or operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, a significant portion of the\nCompany's ATM and credit card interchange income was driven by\ncompanies that mobilized their workforce directly impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These companies represented $5 million or 61% of\nthe $8 million in ATM and credit card interchange income. We anticipate that the related non-interest income will fluctuate in the near term\nbased on COVID-19 pandemic.\nUpdate to 2021 Events Discussed in the Previous 10-K\nFour of our branches are in areas that were impacted by severe, cold weather conditions\nin February and March of 2021. One branch\nsustained water damage but did not impact operations or our ability to support\nour customers. In 2021, the Company repaired and replaced\nthe property and equipment impacted by the water damage. The related cost was primarily\npaid for by our insurance provider.\nDiscussion and Analysis - Results\nof Operations\nNet Interest Income\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest\nincome is the difference between the amounts\nreceived on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing\nliabilities. Net interest income is impacted by internal and\nexternal factors including:\n\u2022\nChanges in the volume, rate, and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities;\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and\neconomic conditions; and\n\u2022\nChanges in credit quality.\nWe present and discuss net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. A tax-equivalent basis presents all income taxable at the same\nrate. For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126.58,\nan amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax\nrate of 21% would yield $100. We believe a tax-equivalent basis provides for\nimproved comparability between the various earning assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 to the second quarter of 2019,\nwe operated in a rising interest rate environment. Our\nyield on earning assets and cost of funds were driven by the rate environment. In\nJuly 2019, interest rates started to decline and continued\nthrough 2021. Our earning assets repriced quicker than our cost of funds, resulting\nin a lower net interest margin in 2019 and 2020. During\n2021, the Company benefited from changes in our deposit mix, including\nan increase in non-interest-bearing deposits and a reduction in time\ndeposits that improved our overall cost of funds. The reduced cost of funds was offset by reductions\nin earning-asset yields. A table showing\nour three-year yield on earning assets and cost of funds is presented below:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nYield on securities - tax equivalent\n(1)\n2.90\n%\n3.05\n%\n3.35\n%\nYield on loans\n4.02\n4.26\n5.52\nYield on earning assets - tax equivalent\n(1)\n3.60\n3.96\n5.04\nCost of interest-bearing deposits\n0.49\n1.02\n2.21\nCost of total deposits\n0.40\n0.85\n1.89\nCost of FHLB and short-term borrowings\n2.09\n1.56\n1.90\nCost of funds\n0.50\n0.92\n1.90\nNet interest margin - tax equivalent\n(1)\n3.15\n%\n3.13\n%\n3.31\n%\n(1)\nTax-exempt income is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis.

Lower\nyields on earning assets were driven by a decline in the interest rate environment\nin the first half of 2020 which persisted in 2021 and\nincreased competition driven by a surge in deposits in 2021. The decline in asset yields was partially\noffset by year-over-year loan growth\nand PPP loan income. PPP loan fees and interest income improved the earning asset yield by 4 basis points for the year ended December\n31,\n2021.\nThe Company currently anticipates loan yields to increase in 2022 due to anticipated rate hikes\nby the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nInterest Expense -\nInterest expense declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in 2020. The\ncost of interest-bearing deposits declined due to strategic rate changes in our\ndeposit products driven by the declining rate environment. The\naverage volume for interest-bearing deposits declined primarily because\nof time deposit maturities and current rates on time deposits.\nAverage FHLB and other borrowings declined compared to 2020, as the\nCompany's increase in cash offset the need to renew or increase\nthese borrowings. The increase in the cost of FHLB borrowings was the result of $771 thousand in prepayment\npenalties related to $40\nmillion of FHLB borrowings. In addition, the increase in the cost of funds was impacted\nby short-term duration borrowings with lower rates\nthat matured in 2020 and were not renewed. We currently anticipate our cost of funds will increase\ndue to expected increases in the interest\nrate environment although that may be offset by a greater mix of non-interest-bearing\ndeposits based on current trends.\nNet Interest Income -\nNet interest income increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in\n2020.\nThe increase in net interest income was driven by reductions in interest-bearing deposit rates as well as\na reduction in time deposits\nwhich was partially offset by lower rates on earning assets. Reductions in\nearning asset yields were offset by reductions in the cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities that resulted in a $747 thousand increase in net\ninterest income.\nWe currently expect the net interest margin to\nremain flat or slightly increase in 2022 as the Company anticipates earning\nassets to reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a rising\nrate environment.\nOur expected margin may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, placing\nloans on non-accrual status,\nincluding loans with deferred payments, and changes in competition.\n$3,679\n$6,083\n$8,707\n$11,733\n$13,660\n0.15%\n0.17%\n0.19%\n0.22%\n0.24%\nNoninterest Income Trend (dollars in thousands)\nTotal noninterest income\nNoninterest income to average assets\nImpact of Transition\nAway from LIBOR\nThe Company had more than $1.3\nbillion in loans tied to LIBOR at December 31, 2021. Starting in October 2021,\nthe Company began\nlimiting loans originated using the LIBOR index. For current borrowers,\nthe Company is modifying loan document language to account for\nthe transition away from LIBOR as loans renew or originate. The Company\nplans to replace LIBOR-based loans with the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate ( SOFR\u201d).\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2020-04 Reference\nRate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation\nof the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d in 2020. The ASU allows the\nCompany to recognize the modification related to LIBOR as a\ncontinuation of the old contract, rather than a cancellation of the old contract\nresulting in a write-off of unamortized fees and creation\nof a\nnew contract.\nNoninterest Income\nThe components of noninterest income were as follows for the periods shown:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService charges and fees on customer accounts\n$\n4,580\n$\n2,803\n$\n1,777\n%\nRealized gains on available-for-sale securities\n1,023\n1,704\n(681)\n(40)\nGains (losses), net on equity securities\n(6,325)\n(6,372)\n(13,558)\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance\n3,483\n1,809\n1,674\nSwap fees and credit valuation adjustments, net\n(204)\n(235)\nATM and credit card interchange income\n7,996\n4,379\n3,617\nOther non-interest income\n2,628\n1,195\n1,433\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n13,660\n$\n11,733\n$\n1,927\n%\nThe changes in noninterest income were driven by the following:\nService charges and fees on customer accounts -\nThis category includes account analysis fees offset by a customer\nrebate program. The\nincrease for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020\nwas driven by a decline in costs associated with our rebate program,\nincluding a reduction in the funded balance and reduction in rates used. In\naddition, customer growth and an increase in outstanding balances\nimproved account analysis fees.\nRealized gains on available-for-sale securities -\nThe Company sells available-for-sale securities for strategic reasons including\ncapitalizing\non attractive market conditions, improving the credit quality of the security portfolio,\nor for tax purposes,\nprimarily to offset capital losses.\nThe realized gains on available-for-sale securities declined from 2020\nto 2021 primarily due to a lower number of securities being sold. In\n2020,\nsales were made to capitalize on attractive market conditions and improve credit\nquality.\nIn 2021, the Company sold securities for tax\npurposes and to capitalize on attractive market conditions.\nGains (losses), net on equity securities -\nDuring 2021, the Company recorded a $6 million loss related to an\nequity investment received as\npart of a modified loan agreement in 2020. The Company elected to account for this security at cost\nless impairment, unless an orderly\ntransaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer occurred that\nwould result in an updated fair market value. During 2021,\nsignificant adverse changes in market conditions for the investment resulted in\nthe investment being sold below its book value. Refer to the\nEquity Securities\u201d section in\nNote 3: Securities\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance -\nThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared\nto 2020 was due to the Company\nrecognizing $2 million in tax-free death benefits from a bank-owned life insurance poli\ncy in 2021 compared to $0 of such proceeds for 2020.\nSwap fee income, net -\nSwap fee income, net, includes both swap fees from the execution of new\nswaps and the credit valuation adjustment\n( CVA\u201d). Swap fees on new swaps depend on the size and term of the underlying\nasset. During 2020, a borrower with a back-to-back swap\nwas downgraded and resulted in a $300 thousand loss related to the CVA. During\n2021, the same borrower chose to eliminate its back-to-\nback swap, resulting in reversal of the CVA adjustment made in 2020.\nATM and credit card interchange income -\nThe increase in ATM and credit card interchange income for the year ended December 31,\ncompared to 2020 was primarily the result of customers that mobilized their workforce directly\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company anticipates the credit card activity and related income will continue\nto fluctuate in connection with changes in COVID-19\ncases and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\nOther non-interest income -\nThe increase in other non-interest income for the year ended December\n31, 2021 compared to 2020 was\nprimarily related to a $809 thousand increase in state employment incentives\nreceived during 2021. We expect to continue to receive the\nincentives quarterly going forward for three years, but at significantly lower\namounts. The Company also saw a $374 thousand increase in\nletter of credit and foreign exchange fees for the period ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to 2020.\n61%\n10%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n0%\n17%\n58%\n9%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n7%\n14%\nSalary & benefits\nOccupancy\nDeposit insurance\nProfessional fees\nSoftware &\ncommunication\nGoodwill\nimpairment\nOther\nBreakout of Noninterest Expense\n12/31/2021\n12/31/2020\n$62,089\n$85,755\n$87,640\n$99,968\n$99,382\n2.53%\n2.45%\n1.95%\n1.87%\n1.78%\nNoninterest Expense (dollars in thousands)\nTotal noninterest expense\nNoninterest expense to average assets\nNoninterest Expense\nThe components of noninterest expense were as follows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalary and employee benefits\n$\n61,080\n$\n57,747\n$\n3,333\n%\nOccupancy\n9,688\n8,701\nProfessional fees\n3,519\n4,218\n(699)\n(17)\nDeposit insurance premiums\n3,705\n4,301\n(596)\n(14)\nData processing\n2,878\n2,719\nAdvertising\n2,090\n1,219\nSoftware and communication\n4,234\n3,750\nForeclosed assets, net\n1,239\n(542)\n(44)\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n7,397\n(7,397)\n(100)\nOther non-interest expense\n11,491\n8,677\n2,814\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n99,382\n$\n99,968\n$\n(586)\n(1)\n%\nThe changes in noninterest expense were driven by the following:\nSalary and Employee Benefits -\nSalary and employee benefit costs increased for the year ended December\n31, 2021\ncompared to 2020\nprimarily due to increased hiring for market expansion and an increase in\nanticipated payouts for performance-based awards that resulted\nfrom improved earnings and asset quality metrics. In addition, the Company\nrecognized $719 thousand in expense during 2021 due to\naccelerated vesting of stock-based awards and the annual incentive award\nof a former employee. We currently anticipate salary and employee\nbenefit costs to increase in 2022 due to new market locations, merit increases and\nadditional hiring.\nOccupancy -\nOccupancy costs increased for the period ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to 2020 primarily due to our new locations in\nthe rapidly growing Frisco, Texas market and Phoenix, Arizona market and our more prominent location on\nthe Country Club Plaza, in\nKansas City, Missouri.\nWe currently anticipate occupancy costs to increase slightly in 2022\nas a result of an additional location in the Dallas\nmarket.\nProfessional Fees -\nProfessional fees decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same corresponding period in 2020\nprimarily from a reduction in legal fees related to PPP loan originations and loan workouts.\nDeposit Insurance Premiums -\nThe FDIC uses a risk-based premium system to calculate the quarterly fee.\nOur costs fluctuate because\nof changes in asset growth, changes in asset quality and changes in capital ratios.\nDuring 2021, the Company benefited from improved\nearnings that increased average tangible equity while average assets remained\nflat between 2020 and 2021.\nAdvertising -\nThe\nincrease in advertising costs was driven by increased in-person events for the year\nended December 31, 2021 compared\nto 2020 because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions being lifted.\nSoftware and Communication -\nThe increase was driven by our continued strategy to invest in technologies that allow us to cover\nbeginning-to-end loan originations, provide customers with a suite of online tools\nand analyze operational trends. In addition to the growing\nnumber of technologies implemented, a portion of the increase in costs was due\nto our growth. We currently anticipate our software and\ncommunication costs to increase in 2022 as we continue adding and implementing\nnew software products that improve our customer's\nexperience.\nForeclosed Assets, net -\nThe decrease in foreclosed assets, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020\nresulted from the\nCompany selling a commercial use facility foreclosed upon in 2020 during\n2021 at a loss that was slightly offset by the sale of raw land\nacquired in 2019 at a gain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nCompany sold industrial facilities acquired in 2019 that resulted in\na $844 thousand loss and impaired raw land acquired in 2019.\nGoodwill Impairment -\nThe Company performed an interim review for goodwill impairment in 2020. A quantitative review was\nperformed on the Tulsa market reporting unit and resulted in a $7 million impairment.\nRefer to\nNote 6: Goodwill and Core Deposit\nIntangible\nwithin the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information.\nOther noninterest expense -\nYear-over-year changes included a $2 million increase in commercial\ncard costs as a result of our growing\ncustomer base and increased use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, insured cash sweep ( ICS\u201d) deposits increased in 2021\nfrom 2020, which drove related fees higher.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would\nbe calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily from\ninvestments in tax advantaged assets, such as bank-owned life insurance\nand tax-exempt municipal securities, state tax credits and permanent\ntax differences from equity-based compensation. Detail behind the differences\nbetween the statutory rate and effective tax rate for the years\nended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is provided in\nNote 11: Income Taxes\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe December 31, 2020 effective tax rate increase from December 31,\n2019 was due to the non-taxable, goodwill impairment in 2020\nand a state tax credit received in 2019. The 2021 income tax expense was impacted\nby a $71.7 million increase in income before income\ntaxes that increased taxes at the statutory rate by $15 million. The tax-exempt benefit diminishes\nas the Company's ratio of taxable income to\ntax-exempt income increases. We currently anticipate the effective tax rate to increase slightly\nin 2022. A three-year trend of our income tax\nand effective tax rate is presented below:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n17,556\n$\n2,713\n$\n4,138\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n86,969\n$\n15,314\n$\n32,611\nEffective tax rate\n%\n%\n%\nDiscussion and Analysis - Financial\nCondition\nLoan Portfolio\nLoans represent our largest portion of earning assets and typically provide higher\nyields than other assets. The quality and\ndiversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when\nreviewing our financial condition. We established an internal loan\npolicy that outlines a standard lending philosophy and provides consistent direction\nto achieve goals and objectives, which include\nmaximizing earnings over the short and long term by managing risks through\nthe policy. Internal concentration limits exist on all loans,\nincluding commercial real estate, energy, and land development. We established strong\nunderwriting practices and procedures to assess our\nborrowers, including review of debt service, collateral value and evaluation\nof guarantors. We also engage third-parties to independently\nreview our loan portfolio. Appropriate actions are taken when a borrower is no longer able to service its debt.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, primarily made up of commercial\nand commercial real estate loans. Commercial\nloans are generally paid back through normal business operations. Commercial\nreal estate loans, which include both construction and limited\nterm financing are typically paid back through normal income from operations,\nthe sale of the underlying property or refinancing by other\ninstitutional sources. Most of our loans are made to borrowers within the states we operate,\nwhich include Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,\nArizona and Texas. In addition, we occasionally invest in syndicated shared national credits and loan\nparticipations.\nGross loans, net of unearned income declined $186 million from the prior\nyear to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our\ncommercial loan portfolio increased by $63 million or 5% as a result of\napproximately $678 million in loan originations and drawdowns that\nwere able to offset commercial loan paydowns.\nOur commercial real estate loans experienced growth of $102 million or 9%. This was driven\nby strong originations of approximately $318 million and approximately\n$108 million of loans that completed construction and were\ntransferred into our commercial real estate portfolio from the construction\nand land development portfolio.\nResidential and multifamily real\nestate decreased $80 million or 12% driven by payoffs of several, larger credit facilities.\nEnergy loans decreased $66 million or 19%\nprimarily due to paydowns on outstanding lines of credit and management's strategy\nto lower our energy loan concentration. Gross loans\nincluded $65 million and $292 million of PPP loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, loan yields\ndeclined to 4.02% compared to 4.26% in the prior year, primarily as a result\nof lower interest rates from adjustable rate loan movements in\nLIBOR and Prime.\nAs of December 31, 2021, PPP loans made up approximately 1% of the total portfolio, representing\n$65 million in loans. Refer to the\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nlocated in Management's Discussion and Analysis section above for additional information regarding PPP\nloans.\nThe following table presents the balance and associated percentage of\neach major product type within our portfolio as of the dates\nindicated:\nAs of December 31,\nAmount\n% of\nLoans\nAmount\n% of\nLoans\nAmount\n% of\nLoans\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\n$\n1,401,681\n%\n$\n1,338,757\n%\n$\n1,356,817\n%\nEnergy\n278,860\n345,233\n408,573\nCommercial real estate\n1,281,095\n1,179,534\n1,024,041\nConstruction and land development\n578,758\n563,144\n628,418\nResidential and multifamily real estate\n600,816\n680,932\n398,695\nPPP\n64,805\n292,230\n-\n-\nConsumer\n63,605\n55,270\n45,163\nGross loans\n4,269,620\n4,455,100\n3,861,707\nLess: unearned income\n13,407\n13,203\n9,463\nGross loans (net of unearned income)\n$\n4,256,213\n%\n$\n4,441,897\n%\n$\n3,852,244\n%\nFor a description of the Company's loan segments refer to the Loan Portfolio\nSegments\u201d section within\nNote 4: Loan and Allowance\nfor Loan Losses\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nReal Estate Loans\nOur real estate portfolio is comprised of construction and development\nloans, residential family and multifamily loans and commercial\nreal estate loans.

Management uses available\ninformation to analyze losses on loans; however, future\nadditions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic\nconditions, the size of the loan portfolio, the composition of the\nportfolio, or the performance of individual loans.\nFor a discussion of the evaluation of the Company's allowance for loan losses refer\nto the Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d section in\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor information regarding the Company's charge-offs and recoveries\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, refer to\nNote 4: Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPrior to 2020, loans risk rated substandard or lower were considered impaired\nand evaluated on an individual basis. For the years\nended December 31, 2020 and 2021, loans risk rated substandard, on accrual\nand not a TDR, were evaluated collectively. The change in\napproach provided a better estimate of potential losses inherent in the substandard\nportfolio.\nThe December 31, 2021 ALLL decreased $17 million or 22% from the prior year. The year-over-year change in the ALLL was the\nresult of $13 million of net charge-offs and $4 million release of reserves. The Company\nupgraded approximately $380 million of loans\nduring the period ended December 31, 2021 and downgraded approximately\n$122 million of loans during the same period. Risk rating\nchanges resulted in a $10 million reduction in the required reserve for 2021.\nThe December 31, 2020 ALLL increased $18 million or 32% from the prior year. The year-over-year change in the ALLL was the\nresult of $38 million of net charge-offs offset by a $57 million increase in our\nprovision. The Company downgraded approximately\n$843 million of loans between December 31, 2019 and 2020. Downgrades primarily\nresulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, lower economic\nactivity and lower oil and gas prices. In addition, substandard, accruing loans not\nconsidered a TDR totaled $187 million at December 31,\n2020 compared to $40 million at December 31, 2019.\nThe December 31, 2019 ALLL increased $19 million or 50% from the prior year. The year-over-year change in the allowance was the\nresult of a $791 million increase in gross loans, net of unearned income that increased\nthe required reserve by approximately $9 million. In\naddition, the allowance included a $13 million increase in the reserve associated\nwith our impaired loans that was primarily the result of one\nnonperforming commercial loan relationship in which the borrower's\nbusiness and the value of the underlying collateral continued to\ndeteriorate in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase was partially offset by a decline in the energy\nportfolio's qualitative loss factors due to\nstabilized oil prices and the current stage of the business cycle that resulted in a $3\nmillion decline in the required reserve.\nGrade Migration\nLoan categories significantly impacted by grade changes are discussed below.\nEnergy\n- Approximately $119 million of energy loans had a risk rating upgrade for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition,\nthe energy portfolio decreased by $66 million in 2021. These changes were\nthe result of higher oil prices and overall market condition\nimprovements. The improvements above resulted in an $9 million reduction in\nthe required reserve for 2021.\nThe increase in supply realized during the first quarter of 2020 and decrease\nin demand for oil and natural gas created by the COVID-\n19 pandemic placed considerable pricing volatility and uncertainty\nin the market for the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, $254\nmillion of energy loans were downgraded, including $83 million downgraded\nto substandard and accruing in 2020. The downgrades\nincreased the December 31, 2020 ALLL by approximately $11 million, including $8 million related to loans downgraded to substandard and\naccruing.\nCommercial Real Estate ( CRE\u201d)\n- The improved market conditions in 2021\npositively impacted our CRE borrowers. During the\nyear-ended December 31, 2021, approximately $150 million\nof CRE loans were upgraded and approximately $95 million were downgrade\nd.\nThe upgrades decreased the ALLL by approximately $5 million for 2021. The improved credit quality of the CRE portfolio was offset by\nloan growth driven by strong originations and customer drawdowns on\nlines of credit that increased the ALLL by approximately $3 million.\nThe decline in economic activity in 2020 impacted our CRE borrowers. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, the Company\ndowngraded $336 million of CRE loans, including $196 million downgraded\nto watch, within our pass rated loan category, and $58 million\ndowngraded to substandard and accruing. The downgrades increased the December\n31, 2020 ALLL by approximately $8 million, including\n$6 million related to loans downgraded to substandard and accruing.\nCommercial\n- The increase in economic activity in 2021 compared to 2020 improved demand\nfor our borrowers' products and\nservices. As a result, approximately $110 million of commercial loans were upgraded,\npartially offset by $21 million that were downgraded.\nThe improved credit quality reduced the ALLL by $2 million, partially offset by commercial loan growth that increased the ALLL.\nThe decline in economic activity in 2020 significantly impacted supply and\ndemand for our borrowers' products and services. As a\nresult, $232 million of commercial loans were downgraded, including\n$56 million of loans listed as substandard and accruing. The\ndowngrades increased the ALLL by approximately $6 million from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.\nCharge-offs and Recoveries\nThe below table provides the ratio of net charge-offs (recoveries) during\nthe period to average loans outstanding based on our loan\ncategories:\nFor the Period Ended December 31,\nCommercial\n0.96\n%\n2.04\n%\n0.64\n%\nEnergy\n0.32\n1.34\n0.64\nCommercial real estate\n-\n0.14\n0.05\nConstruction and land development\n-\n-\n-\nResidential and multifamily real estate\n(0.06)\n0.07\n-\nPPP\n-\n-\n-\nConsumer\n(0.01)\n0.22\n0.04\nTotal net charge-offs to average loans\n0.30\n%\n0.89\n%\n0.31\n%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, charge-offs primarily related\nto three commercial borrowers that were unable to support their\ndebt obligations and one energy loan. The energy charge-off related to the sale of collateral\nfrom a borrower that filed for bankruptcy in a\nprevious year. Recoveries totaled $703 thousand as of December 31, 2021\nand were primarily related to a commercial loan and a residential\nreal estate loan that were previously charged-off in 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, charge-offs included: (i) $19 million\nrelated to a commercial loan that deteriorated and was\nsubstantially reserved for during 2019 that required a $2 million increase to\nthe 2020 provision, (ii) $6 million related to a large commercial\nloan restructured in 2020 that required a $5 million increase to the 2020 provision,\n(iii) $6 million related to several, smaller commercial\nloans that required a $5 million increase to the 2020 provision, (iv) $5 million\nrelated to three energy loans that were classified or listed as\nspecial mention in 2019 and required a $4 million increase to the 2020 provision,\nand (iv) a $2 million charge-off related to a commercial\nreal estate loan impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that required\na $1 million increase to the 2020 provision.\nCharge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2019 included $8 million\nrelated to two commercial loans. The commercial loans were\npartially charged-off. In addition, one energy credit accounted for $3\nmillion in charge-offs during 2019.\nImpaired Loans and Other Factors\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the impaired loan portfolio\ndecreased $65 million compared to December 31, 2020. The\nreserve on the impaired loan portfolio decreased $4 million driven by\npaydowns and risk rating upgrades. Changes in qualitative and\nquantitative rates on pass rated loans decreased the ALLL by $1 million due to improved general economic conditions offset by balance\nincreases on pass rated loans that increased the ALLL by $5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the impaired loan portfolio increased\nthe ALLL by $7 million after taking out the impact of\nthe charge-offs mentioned above. Changes in qualitative and quantitative\nrates on pass rated loans increased the ALLL by $6 million\nprimarily due to an increase in 2020 charge-offs that impacted the historical charge\n-off ratios and declines in economic activity offset by\nbalance reductions on pass rated loans that decreased the ALLL by $4 million.\nWhile no portion of our allowance for loan losses is in any way restricted to any individual\nloan or group of loans and the entire\nallowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans, the following\ntables represent management's allocation of our allowance to\nspecific loan categories for the periods indicated:\nFor the Period Ended December 31,\n$\n%\n$\n%\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nCommercial\n$\n20,352\n%\n$\n24,693\n%\n$\n35,864\n%\nEnergy\n9,229\n18,341\n6,565\nCommercial real estate\n19,119\n22,354\n8,085\nConstruction and land development\n3,749\n3,612\n3,516\nResidential and multifamily real estate\n5,598\n5,842\n2,546\nPPP\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nConsumer\nTotal allowance for loan losses\n$\n58,375\n%\n$\n75,295\n%\n$\n56,896\n%\nNonperforming Assets\nNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed assets held\nfor sale and impaired securities. Nonperforming loans\ninclude nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\ninterest and loans modified under TDR that are not performing in\naccordance with their modified terms. For information regarding nonperforming\nloans and related accounting policies refer to the\nNonperforming Loans\u201d section within\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nwithin the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. For a breakout of the loan portfolio's nonaccrual\nloans refer to Nonaccrual loans\u201d within\nNote 4: Loans\nand Allowance for Loan Losses\n. For information on TDRs, refer to Troubled Debt Restructurings\u201d section in\nNote 4: Loans and Allowance\nfor Loan Losses\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt December 31, 2021, nonperforming assets decreased $46 million or 58%\nfrom December 31, 2020 due primarily to upgrades and\npay offs in the commercial and energy portfolios. As of December 31, 2021, 49% of nonperforming assets related to energy\ncredits\nthat were\nsignificantly impacted by lower oil prices over the past few years.\nAt December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets increased $31 million or\n64% from 2019. $60 million of loans became nonperforming in\n2020, offset by a $19 million charge-off in 2020 on a nonperforming loan with\na balance of $21 million at December 31, 2019 and pay\ndowns of $6 million related to December 31, 2019 nonperforming loans. A number of nonperforming loans were significantly impacted by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Nonperforming loans included businesses in the following\nindustries: (i) hotel, (ii) senior housing, and a few\ncommercial credits. As of December 31, 2020, 34% of the nonperforming asset balance related to energy credits caused\nby volatility in the\noil and natural gas market.\nAt December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets increased $30 million or\n169% from 2018. During 2019, a commercial loan relationship\nwith an outstanding balance of $30 million was restructured as a TDR due to financial\nproblems. By December 31, 2019, the commercial\nTDR was in default of the modified terms as the borrower's business and the value of\nthe underlying collateral continued to deteriorate. This\n$30 million loan relationship was the primary reason for the increase in nonperforming\nassets and the increase in the ALLL to period end\nnonperforming loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company foreclosed\non $4 million of assets, including land and industrial assets.\nThese assets related to one commercial loan and one commercial real estate loan. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, these assets\nwere written-down by $1 million and the industrial facilities were sold. In\naddition, the Company foreclosed on a commercial real estate\nbuilding valued at $1 million. For information regarding the foreclosed\nassets held-for-sale refer to\nNote 8: Foreclosed Assets\nwithin the\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the Company's nonperforming assets for the dates indicated:\nFor the Period Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans\n$\n31,432\n$\n75,051\n$\n39,675\nLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing\n1,024\n4,591\nTotal nonperforming loans\n31,522\n76,075\n44,266\nForeclosed assets held-for-sale\n1,148\n2,347\n3,619\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n32,670\n$\n78,422\n$\n47,885\nALLL to total loans\n1.37\n%\n1.70\n%\n1.48\n%\nALLL to nonaccrual loans\n185.72\n100.33\n143.41\nALLL to nonperforming loans\n185.19\n98.98\n128.54\nNonaccrual loans to total loans\n0.74\n1.69\n1.03\nNonperforming loans to total loans\n0.74\n1.71\n1.15\nNonperforming assets to total assets\n0.58\n%\n1.39\n%\n0.97\n%\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, $2 million of interest income\nwas recognized related to the $31 million in nonaccrual loans\nabove.

If the loans had been current in accordance with their original\nterms and had been outstanding through the period or since inception,\nthe gross interest income that would have been recorded for the year\nended December 31, 2020 would have been $2 million.\nOther Asset Quality Metrics\nOther asset quality metrics management reviews include loans past due\n30 - 89 days and classified loans. The Company defines\nclassified loans as loans categorized as substandard - performing, substandard\n- nonperforming, doubtful or loss. For the definitions of\nsubstandard, doubtful and loss, refer to the Loans by Risk Rating\u201d section within\nNote 4: Loan and Allowance for Loan Losses\nin the Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe decrease in the balance of December 31, 2021 loans past due between 30\nand 89 days was driven by improved market conditions\nand improved credit quality metrics during 2021 as classified assets decreased\n$209 million and the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total\nloans decreased to 1.37%\nfrom 1.70%\nin the prior year. The improvements in credit metrics were primarily driven by upgrades in\nCOVID-19\nimpacted segments and the energy portfolio.\nThe Company continually analyzes economic and other factors including\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in oil\nand gas prices among other considerations.\nOur discussion regarding grade migration is provided within the allowance\nfor loan losses\u201d\nsection above.\n$702\n$662\n$739\n$655\n$746\n3.85%\n3.62%\n3.35%\n3.05%\n2.90%\nInvestment Portfolio ($M)\nTotal debt securities\nYield on securities (FTE)\nThe following table summarizes our loans past due 30 - 89 days, classified assets and\nrelated ratios:\nFor the Period Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLoan Past Due Detail\n30 - 59 days past due\n$\n1,671\n$\n10,137\n$\n6,292\n60 - 89 days past due\n1,858\n7,941\nTotal 30 - 89 days past due\n$\n3,529\n$\n18,078\n$\n6,822\nLoans 30 - 89 days past due / gross loans\n0.08\n%\n0.41\n%\n0.18\n%\nClassified Loans\nSubstandard - performing\n$\n47,275\n$\n211,008\n$\n47,221\nSubstandard - nonperforming\n28,879\n70,734\n34,192\nDoubtful\n2,554\n4,315\n5,483\nLoss\n-\n-\n-\nTotal classified loans\n78,708\n286,057\n86,896\nForeclosed assets held for sale\n1,148\n2,347\n3,619\nTotal classified assets\n$\n79,856\n$\n288,404\n$\n90,515\nClassified loans / (total capital + ALLL)\n10.8\n%\n40.9\n%\n13.2\n%\nClassified assets / (total capital + ALLL)\n11.0\n%\n41.2\n%\n13.7\n%\nALLL to total loans\n1.37\n%\n1.70\n%\n1.48\n%\nNet charge-offs to average loans\n0.30\n%\n0.89\n%\n0.31\n%\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment portfolio is governed by our investment policy that sets our\nobjectives, limits and liquidity requirements among other\nitems. The portfolio is maintained to serve as a contingent, on-balance sheet source\nof liquidity. The objective of our investment portfolio is\nto optimize earnings, manage credit risk, ensure adequate liquidity, manage\ninterest rate risk, meet pledging requirements and meet\nregulatory capital requirements. Our investment portfolio is generally\ncomprised of government sponsored entity securities and U.S. state\nand political subdivision securities with limits set on all types of securities.\nAt the date of purchase, all debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.\nSince interest rates move in cycles, having an\navailable-for-sale portfolio allows management to: (i) protect against additional\nunrealized market valuation losses; (ii) provide more\nliquidity as rates rise, which often coincides with increasing loan demand\nand slower deposit growth; and (iii) generate more money to\nreinvest when rates are higher giving the institution an opportunity to lock in\nhigher yields. In the event the available-for-sale portfolio\nbecomes too large given the constraints set in the policy, investments may be classified\nas held-to-maturity. Held-to-maturity classification\nwill only be used if we have the intent and ability to hold the investment to\nits maturity.\nAt December 31, 2021, available-for-sale debt securities increased $91\nmillion or 14% from the prior year-end. During 2021, the\nCompany purchased $117 million of tax-exempt municipal securities and $108\nmillion of mortgage-backed securities primarily to utilize\nliquidity and increase the Company's interest-earning assets.\nAs part of management's investment strategy during 2020, the Company\nchose not to replace all the cash flows associated with\nmortgage-backed security prepayments and realized gains from\nselling securities that were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nor at risk of possible downgrades. Securities showing signs of credit stress, faster\nprepayments and low reinvestment yield options were\nanalyzed to ensure adequate levels of risk were maintained within the portfolio.\nDuring 2019, the investment portfolio increased to manage our liquidity\nposition. In 2018, the investment portfolio declined from the\nprior year as we moved liquid assets to support higher yielding assets. Prior to fiscal year\n2018, we purchased securities of states of the U.S.\nand political subdivisions as part of our tax and liquidity strategies.\nFor information related to the book value and fair value of our available\n-for-sale securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 refer to the\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\u201d segment in\nNote 3: Securities\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For information\nrelated to the investment maturity schedule and weighted average yield for\neach range of maturities refer to the Maturity Schedule\u201d segment\nin\nNote 3: Securities\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance ( BOLI\u201d)\nThe Company maintains investments in BOLI policies to help control employee\nbenefit costs, as a protection against loss of certain\nemployees and as a tax planning strategy. The increase in yield in 2021 was primarily due to the Company\nrecognizing $2 million in tax-free\ndeath benefits from a bank-owned life insurance policy. The decline in yield between\nDecember 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 was\nattributable to the insurance carrier's underlying investments and operating\ncosts that decreased overall income on the underlying asset.\nThe following table provides the balance of BOLI income earned and tax-equivalent\nyield for the periods indicated:\nAs of or For the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nEnding balance\n$\n67,498\n$\n67,498\n$\n65,689\nIncome earned\n$\n3,483\n$\n1,809\n$\n1,878\nTax-equivalent yield\n(1)\n6.4\n%\n3.4\n%\n3.6\n%\n(1)\nTax exempt income is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis. BOLI income is exempt from federal and state taxes. The incremental tax rate used is 24.7%\nbetween 2019 and 2021.\nDeposits\nDeposits come through our markets as well as through participation in\ncertain wholesale programs. The Company offers a variety of\ndeposit products including non-interest-bearing demand deposits and interest-bearing\ndeposits that include transaction accounts (including\nNOW accounts), savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit. The Bank also\nacquires brokered deposits, internet\nsubscription certificates of deposit, and reciprocal deposits through\nthe Intrafi Network. The reciprocal deposits include both the Certificate\nof Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS\u201d) and Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) program. The Company is a member of\nthe Intrafi\nNetwork which effectively allows depositors to receive FDIC insurance on\namounts greater than the FDIC insurance limit, which is currently\n$250 thousand. The Intrafi Network allows institutions to break large deposits into smaller amounts\nand place them in a network of other\nIntrafi Network institutions to ensure full FDIC insurance is gained on the entire deposit.\n$2,303\n$3,208\n$3,924\n$4,695\n$4,684\n0.99%\n1.44%\n1.89%\n0.85%\n0.40%\nTotal Deposits ($M) and Cost of Deposits\nTotal deposits\nCost of deposits\nDeposit accounts are added by loan cross-selling, client referrals and involvement\nwithin our community.\nAt December 31, 2021, deposits decreased $11 million or less than 1% from\nthe prior year-end. Non-interest-bearing deposits\nincreased $445 million or 62% from December 31, 2020 to December\n31, 2021. The increase in non-interest-bearing deposits was driven by\napproximately $350 million of increased deposits from current customers\nand approximately $363 million from new deposit relationships,\noffset by deposit withdrawals.\nAt December 31, 2021, non-interest-bearing deposits represented 25%\nof total deposits. Savings and money\nmarket deposits increased $205 million as of December 31, 2021\nas a result of both new deposit relationships and increased deposits from\ncurrent customers. Transaction deposits and time deposits decreased by $242 million\nand $419 million, respectively. The significant decrease\nin time deposits resulted from the low interest rate environment. Approximately $794 million of time deposits matured\nin 2021, offset by\n$394 million of new and renewed time deposits. As a result of the change in deposit mix and reduction of deposit interest rates, the\nCompany\nimproved the overall cost of deposits, which declined 45 basis points compared\nto December 31, 2020.\nDuring 2020, deposits grew $771 million or 20% from the prior year. Deposit growth\nwas driven by demand in our ICS deposit\nproduct that increased $516 million from the prior year. The ICS product provided customers\nwith the ability to manage their cash flow\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic while providing insurance. In addition,\nour interest-bearing checking accounts saw higher demand due to\nPPP loan fundings. Compared to 2019, time deposits declined by $196 million or 16% and money\nmarket deposits declined by $52 million as\ncustomers moved into more attractive products.\nThe following table sets forth deposit balances by certain categories as of\nthe dates indicated and the percentage of each deposit category to total deposits:\nAs of December 31,\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n$\n1,163,224\n%\n$\n718,459\n%\n$\n521,826\n%\nTransaction deposits\n536,225\n778,124\n259,435\nSavings and money market deposits\n2,359,761\n2,154,675\n1,902,752\nTime deposits\n(1)\n624,387\n1,043,482\n1,239,746\nTotal deposits\n$\n4,683,597\n%\n$\n4,694,740\n%\n$\n3,923,759\n%\nTotal uninsured deposits\n(2)\n$\n2,413,533\n$\n2,223,586\n$\n1,873,794\n(1)\nIncludes $91 million, $188 million and $392 million of brokered deposits, representing\n15%, 18% and 32% of time deposits for the years ended December\n31, 2021, 2020 and\n2019, respectively.\n(2)\nBased on estimated amounts of uninsured deposits and are based on the\nsame methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory reporting\nrequirements.\nThe following table sets forth the maturity of time deposits as of December\n31, 2021:\nAs of December 31, 2021\nThree Months or Less\nThree to Six Months\nSix to Twelve Months\nAfter Twelve Months\nTotal\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTime deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit\n$\n70,936\n$\n23,688\n$\n117,376\n$\n18,066\n$\n230,066\nTime deposits below FDIC insurance limit\n105,591\n74,352\n146,266\n68,112\n394,321\nTotal time deposits\n$\n176,527\n$\n98,040\n$\n263,642\n$\n86,178\n$\n624,387\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $2.4\nbillion of uninsured deposits, which is an estimated amount based on the same methodologies\nand assumptions\nused for the Bank's regulatory requirements. The Company believes that its current\ncapital ratios and liquidity are sufficient to mitigate the risks of uninsured\ndeposits.\nOther Borrowed Funds\nSince it may not be possible to achieve the institution's overall funding needs\nthrough core deposit funding, other borrowings may be used to support asset growth.\nManagement\nhas a funds management policy and committee, which supports the use of\nother borrowings. The risks associated with other borrowings are addressed in the same\nfashion as other balance\nsheet risks incurred by the Bank.

The obligations include deposit liabilities,\nother borrowed funds, and operating leases. Refer to\nNote 10: Borrowing Arrangements\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for a listing of our December 31, 2021 significant contractual\ncash obligations to third parties on debt obligations. Refer to\nNote\n18: Operating Leases\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary\nof our contractual cash obligations to third\nparties on lease obligations.\nAs a financial services provider, the Company is a party to various financial instruments\nwith off-balance sheet risks, such as\ncommitments to extend credit.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements represent the Company's future cash requirements.\nHowever, a portion of\nthese commitments may expire without being drawn upon. Refer to\nNote 21: Commitments and Credit Risk\nwithin the Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for a listing of our December 31, 2021 off-balance\nsheet arrangements.\nThe Company's short-term and long\n-term contractual obligations, including off-balance\nsheet obligations, may be satisfied through\nour on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity\ndiscussed below.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash from depositors,\nstockholders, profits or other funding sources, to meet\nour needs for funding, including payments to borrowers, operational\ncosts, capital requirements and other strategic cash flow needs.\nOur liquidity policy governs our approach to our liquidity position. The objective is to maintain\nadequate, but not excessive, liquidity\nto meet the daily cash flow needs of our clients while attempting to achieve\nadequate earnings for our stockholders. Our liquidity position is\nmonitored continuously by our finance department.\nLiquidity resources can be derived from two sources: (i) on-balance\nsheet liquidity resources, which represent funds currently on the\nbalance sheet; and (ii) off-balance sheet liquidity resources, which represent\nfunds available from third-party sources. On-balance sheet\nliquidity resources include overnight funds, short-term deposits with other\nbanks, available-for-sale ( AFS\u201d) securities, and certain other\nsources. Off-balance sheet liquidity resources consist of credit lines, wholesale\ndeposits and debt funding and certain other sources.\nOn-balance sheet liquidity resources can be broken down into three\nsections: (i) primary liquidity resources, which represent liquid\nfunds that are on the balance sheet; (ii) tertiary liquidity resources, which represent\nassets that can be sold into the secondary market; and (iii)\npublic funds, which represent deposits. Primary liquidity resources\ninclude overnight funds plus short-term, interest-bearing deposits with\nother banks and unpledged AFS securities. Tertiary liquidity resources include loans that can be sold into the secondary market or\nthrough\nparticipation and unpledged securities classified as held-to-maturity.\nPublic funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they require\ncollateral.\nOff-balance sheet liquidity resources require sufficient collateral, in the\nform of loans or securities, and have a larger, negative impact\non our capital ratios. As a result, off-balance sheet liquidity has a higher cost on our asset growth compared to deposit growth.\nOff-balance\nsheet liquidity exists in several forms including: (i) internet subscription\ncertificates of deposit; (ii) brokered deposits; (iii) borrowing\ncapacity; (iv) repurchase agreements; or (v) other sources.\nInternet subscription certificates of deposit are deposits made through national,\nwholesale certificates of deposit funding programs.\nThese programs are designed to provide funding outside of the Bank's normal\nmarket or existing client base and allow the Bank to diversify\nits wholesale funding resources. This form of funding does not require collateral and generally\ncannot be redeemed early. Brokered deposits\nare deposits funded through various broker-dealer relationships. The market for\nwholesale deposits is well developed. A key feature of this\ntype of funding is that it is generally unsecured and does not require collateral\nfor pledging.\nBorrowing capacity refers to a form of liability-based funding. Repurchase\nagreements are another source of short-term funding in\nwhich a bank agrees to sell a security to a counterparty and repurchase the same or\nan identical security from the counterparty at a specified\nfuture date and price. Public funds are another source of wholesale deposits as they\nrequire collateral.\nOur short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily met\nthrough cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying\nand maturing balances in our loan portfolio and security portfolio, increases\nin client deposits and wholesale deposits. Other alternative\nsources of funds will supplement these primary sources to the extent necessary\nto meet additional liquidity requirements on either a short-\nterm or long-term basis.\nThe Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources\nand uses of cash by type of activity for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $483 million compared\nto $409 million at\nDecember 31, 2020. The change in cash and cash equivalents was due to an $88 million increase in\ncash provided by operating activities, a\n$93 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities and net\ncash provided by investing activities of $79 million. During 2021,\nliquid assets increased as deposit growth outpaced loan growth. Depositors increased\nas customer liquidity improved through various\neconomic factors. In addition, the Company was able to payoff matured borrowings\nwithout replacing them with new debt. Our portfolio of\non-balance sheet and off-balance sheet liquidity continues to exceed\nthe amount we estimate we would need to manage through an adverse\nliquidity event.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $409 million compared\nto $187 million at December 31, 2019. The\nchange in cash and cash equivalents was due to an $80 million increase in cash provided\nby operating activities, a $686 million increase in\ncash provided by financing activities and net cash used in investing activities of $545\nmillion. During 2020, liquid assets increased as an\nindirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds from PPP loans increased demand deposits and the Company's overall\nliquidity as\nPPP loan proceeds\nwaited to be disbursed. Loan growth was lower than deposit growth as customers protected\ntheir liquid positions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had the following available\nfunding:\nAs of December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOn-balance sheet liquidity\n(1)\n$\n1,224,253\n$\n1,046,110\n$\n888,080\nOff-balance sheet liquidity\n(2)\n732,748\n756,325\n524,332\nTotal liquidity\n$\n1,957,001\n$\n1,802,435\n$\n1,412,412\nOn-balance sheet liquidity\n(1)\nas a percent of assets\n%\n%\n%\nTotal liquidity as a percent of assets\n%\n%\n%\n(1)\nOn-balance sheet liquidity represents funds currently on the balance sheet.

Refer to Item 1. Business under the\nSupervision and Regulation\u201d section for a detailed discussion regarding\nour capital requirements.\nThe Company monitors our capital ratios using forecasts and stress testing. Based on\nour capital ratios in 2020 and 2021 we were\nconsidered well-capitalized. As of December 31, 2021, the FDIC categorized the Bank as well-capitalized\u201d under\nthe prompt corrective\naction framework. There have been no conditions or events since December 31,\n2021 that management believes would change this\nclassification.\nRefer to\nNote 13: Regulatory Matters\nin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the table that\nsummarizes the capital\nrequirements applicable to the Company and the Bank in order to be considered\nwell-capitalized\u201d from a regulatory perspective, as well as\nthe Company's and the Bank's capital ratios as of December 31, 2021\nand 2020.

For the years ended December\n31, 2020 and 2021, the Company's equity increased primarily due\nto an increase in net income and changes to the unrealized gain on\navailable-for-sale securities.\nThe following graph presents total stockholders' equity and book value per share as of the end of the periods\nindicated:\nChanges in stockholders' equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 are provided in the Consolidated\nStatements of Stockholders' Equity. Additional information regarding the Company's stock activity is provided in\nNote 22: Stock Offerings\nand Repurchases\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nA primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility. Managing interest rate risk is a key element of our balance\nsheet\nmanagement. Interest rate risk is the risk that net interest margins will be eroded over\ntime due to changing market conditions. Many factors\ncan cause margins to erode: (i) lower loan demand; (ii) increased competition\nfor funds; (iii) weak pricing policies; (iv) balance sheet\nmismatches; and (v) changing liquidity demands. We manage our sensitivity position\nusing our interest rate risk policy. The management of\ninterest rate risk is a three-step process and involves: (i) measuring the interest\nrate risk position; (ii) policy constraints; and (iii) strategic\nreview and implementation.\nOur exposure to interest rate risk is managed by the Bank's Funds Management\nCommittee ( FMC\u201d) in accordance with policies\napproved by the Bank's board of directors. The FMC uses a combination of three systems to measure\nthe balance sheet's interest rate risk\nposition. Because each system serves a different purpose and provides a different\nperspective, the three systems in combination are expected\nto provide a better overall result than a single system alone. The three systems include:\n(i) gap reports; (ii) earnings simulation; and (iii)\neconomic value of equity.\n\u2022\nA gap report measures the repricing volume of assets and liabilities by time period. The difference between repricing assets and\nrepricing liabilities for a particular time period is known as the periodic repricing\ngap. Using this method, it is possible to estimate\nthe impact on earnings of a given rate change. As a method of evaluating interest rate risk, the gap report is a reasonably\naccurate\nmethod of assessing earnings exposure. However, its reliability diminishes\nas balance sheet complexity increases. Optionality and\nother factors complicate the analysis.\n\u2022\nAn earnings simulation measures the effect of changing interest rates on net interest\nincome and earnings. Earnings simulation is\nmore detailed than gap analysis. Under this approach, the repricing characteristics\nof each asset and liability instrument are\nprogrammed into a computer simulation model. This programming allows the Bank\nto refine important characteristics such as caps,\nfloors, and time lag. It also allows the Bank to include the impact of new business\nactivity in the analysis. Gap reporting only\nconsiders the existing balance sheet position.\n\u2022\nEconomic Value of Equity ( EVE\u201d) is a valuation approach to measuring long-term\ninterest rate risk exposure. This approach\nconsiders all future time periods, which provides an advantage over earnings\nsimulation. However, a negative attribute of EVE is\nthat it assumes a sustained change in rates, which is never the case in the long-term. This seeks to compute\nthe financial risk of\nhaving a duration mismatch between assets and funding.\nIn addition, the FMC compares the current interest rate risk position to policy limits. This procedure\nis compliance oriented and results\nin either a pass or fail outcome. When the balance sheet is in compliance, no further\naction is necessary. In instances of noncompliance, the\nFMC will develop a plan of action to correct the condition. A summary of the plan and its timing for completion will be forwarded to the\nboard of directors each quarter until compliance is reestablished.\nThe FMC also evaluates interest rate risk positioning in light of anticipated\ninterest rates. The purpose of this comparison is to\ndetermine whether action steps need to be taken to modify current strategy. The results form a decision-making\ninput for the committee. If it\nis determined that more asset sensitivity is needed, the committee will either increase\nrate sensitive assets or reduce rate sensitive liabilities.\nThe opposite will occur if less asset sensitivity is desired.\nLoan and deposit repricing assumptions are critical in measuring interest rate risk.\nFor loans, management reviews spreads and\nprepayment assumptions. For deposits, management reviews beta\nfactors and decay assumptions. The FMC reviews and adjusts repricing\nassumptions at least annually. Model assumptions are included in the output\nreports and reviewed by the FMC on a periodic basis.\nWhen evaluating balance sheet rate sensitivity, a proper analysis of total funding\nis of critical importance. The funding side of the\nbalance sheet can be segregated into three broad categories, as follows: (i) funding\nwith defined maturity dates; (ii) non-maturity deposits;\nand (iii) perpetual funding.\n\u2022\nFunding with defined maturity dates includes certificates of deposit and\nborrowed funds. The repricing analysis requires a twofold\nstatement of behavior for each balance sheet category. It requires a cash flow schedule\nfor principal and interest payments and a\nrepricing schedule of rate adjustments. Once the cash flow and repricing\nprojections are developed, the category can be analyzed for\ninterest rate risk exposure.\n\u2022\nNon-maturity deposits tend to be a longer term, less volatile source of funds. Non-maturity\ndeposits have very short contractual\nlives. The Bank uses historical analysis to develop its decay assumptions, but it looks at aggregate\naccount types rather than\nindividual clients. The review analyzes both non-maturity deposits as a whole and individual\ndeposit categories.\n\u2022\nPerpetual funding is the most stable and least costly source of funding. Its main\ncomponent is equity capital. It has a zero interest\nrate and cannot be withdrawn by stockholders because of a rate change.\nIn effect, it is a perpetual source of free funding.\nTo ensure a formal evaluation process, periodic independent evaluations\nare conducted and documented. Such evaluation consists\nprimarily of: (i) an assessment of internal controls; (ii) an evaluation of data\nintegrity; (iii) the appropriateness of the risk management\nsystem; (iv) the reasonableness of validity scenarios; (v) a review of the\nFMC policy; and (vi) validation of calculations. In addition, to\nensure the model is working as expected a back test of the model is completed\nat least annually.\nAll of the assumptions used in our analysis are inherently uncertain and,\nas a result, the model cannot precisely measure future net\ninterest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest\nrates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from\nthe model's simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency\nof interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the\napplication and timing of various management strategies.\nOn a quarterly basis, we run various simulation models including a static balance\nsheet and dynamic growth balance sheet. These\nmodels test the impact on net interest income and fair value of equity from changes\nin market interest rates under various scenarios. Under\nthe static model and dynamic growth models, rates are shocked instantaneously\nand ramped rates change over a 12-month horizon based\nupon parallel and nonparallel yield curve shifts. Parallel shock scenarios\nassume instantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve\ncompared to a flat yield curve scenario. Nonparallel simulation involves\nanalysis of interest income and expense under various changes in the\nshape of the yield curve.\nOur internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently\nspecifies that for instantaneous parallel shifts of the yield curve,\nestimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period\nshould not decline by more than 5% for a -100 basis point shift, 5%\nfor a 100 basis point shift, 10% for a 200 basis point shift, 15% for a 300 basis point\nshift, and 20% for a 400 basis point shift.\nThe Company has several instruments that can be used to manage interest rate risk,\nincluding: (i) modifying the duration of interest-\nbearing liabilities; (ii) modifying the duration of interest-earning assets, including\nour investment portfolio; and (iii) entering into on-balance\nsheet derivatives. Based upon the nature of our operations, we are not subject to\nforeign exchange or commodity price risk.\nThe FMC evaluates interest rate risk using a rate shock method and rate\nramp method. In a rate shock analysis, rates change\nimmediately and the change is sustained over the time horizon. In a rate\nramp analysis, rate changes occur gradually over time. The\nfollowing tables summarize the simulated changes in net interest income and\nfair value of equity over a 12 month horizon using a rate shock\nand rate ramp method as of the dates indicated:\nHypothetical Change in Interest Rate - Rate Shock\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nChange in Interest Rate\n(Basis Points)\nPercent Change in\nNet Interest Income\nPercent Change in\nFair Value of Equity\nPercent Change in\nNet Interest Income\nPercent Change in\nFair Value of Equity\n+300\n7.9\n%\n(7.7)\n%\n1.2\n%\n(10.3)\n%\n+200\n4.6\n(4.7)\n0.4\n(6.2)\n+100\n1.5\n(2.7)\n(0.3)\n(2.8)\nBase\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\n(1)\nThe Company decided to exclude the down rate environment from its analysis due to the already low interest rate environment.\nHypothetical Change in Interest Rate - Rate Ramp\nDecember 31, 2021\nDecember 31, 2020\nChange in Interest Rate\n(Basis Points)\nPercent Change in Net Interest Income\nPercent Change in Net Interest Income\n+300\n3.4\n%\n0.9\n%\n+200\n1.9\n0.3\n+100\n0.6\n(0.1)\nBase\n-\n%\n-\n%\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\nNA\n(1)\n(1)\nThe Company decided to exclude the down rate environment from its analysis due to the already low interest rate environment.\nThe hypothetical positive change in net interest income as of December\n31, 2021 in an up 100 environment is primarily due to\napproximately two-thirds of the Company's earning assets adjusting\nwithin the first year. In addition, the Company's time deposits and other\nborrowings will continue to mature. Increases in the up 100 environment are\nimpacted by floors on variable rate loans. In an up 200 and 300\nenvironment, floors on variable rate loans become less impactful and\nearning assets reprice faster than interest-bearing liabilities. Loans\nremain the largest portion of our adjustable earning assets, as the mix of\nadjustable loans or those maturing in one year was 76%.\nThe models the Company uses include assumptions regarding interest\nrates and balance changes.\nThese assumptions are inherently\nuncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income\nor precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest\nrates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of\ninterest rate changes\nas well as changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management\nstrategies, among other factors.\nCritical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP and with general practices within the financial services\nindustry. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the\namounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our\nestimates on historical experience and on various other\nassumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances. These assumptions\nform the basis for our judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from independent,\nobjective sources. We evaluate our estimates on an\nongoing basis. Use of alternative assumptions may have resulted in significantly\ndifferent estimates. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates.\nThe Company qualifies as an EGC under the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the\nextended transition period when complying with new or revised accounting\nstandards. This allows an EGC to delay adoption of certain\naccounting standards until those standards would apply to private companies;\nhowever, the EGC can still early adopt new or revised\naccounting standards, if applicable. We have elected to take advantage of this extended\ntransition period, which means the financial\nstatements in this Form 10-K, as well as financial statements we file in the future,\nwill be subject to all new or revised accounting standards\ngenerally applicable to private companies, unless stated otherwise. This decision will remain\nin effect until the Company loses its EGC\nstatus.\nOur most significant accounting policies are described in\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We identified the\nfollowing accounting policies and estimates that, due to\nthe difficult, subjective or complex judgments and assumptions inherent\nin those policies and estimates and the potential sensitivity of our\nfinancial statements to those judgments and assumptions, are critical to\nan understanding of our financial condition and results of operations.\nDescription\nJudgments and\nUncertainties\nRanges over the Last\nThree Years\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nAllowance for Loan Losses:\nThe ALLL is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit\nlosses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when\nmanagement believes the collectability of a loan balance is\nunlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the\nallowance.\nThe allowance consists of specific and general components.\nThe specific component relates to loans that are individually\nclassified as impaired. A loan is considered impaired when,\nbased on current information and events, it is probable that the\nBank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the\noriginal contractual terms of the loan agreement. If a loan is\nimpaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan\nis reported net at the present value of estimated future cash\nflows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of\ncollateral if repayment is expected solely from the sale of the\ncollateral.\nThe general component covers the remaining pool of loans and\nis based on historical charge-off experience and expected loss\ngiven default derived from the Company's internal risk rating\nprocess. Other adjustments may be made to the allowance for\npools of loans after an assessment of internal or external\ninfluences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the\nhistorical loss or risk rating data.\nThe determination of the\nCompany's ALLL\ncontains uncertainties\nbecause it requires\nmanagement to make\nassumptions and\njudgments regarding\nfuture uncollectible\namounts on the loan\nportfolio.\nImpaired loans may be\nimpacted by\nmanagement's decisions\non the marketability\ndiscount.\nThe general component\nof the ALLL may be\nimpacted by\nmanagement's decisions\non qualitative rates and\nloan risk ratings.\nYear-end ALLL Balance:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2019 - $56,896\n2020 - $75,295\n2021 - $58,375\nLoan Provision:\n(Dollars in thousands)\n2019 - $29,900\n2020 - $56,700\n2021 - ($4,000)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company\nseparated substandard loans into performing and\nnonperforming categories that were previously\nconsolidated. The new approach provided a better estimate\nof potential losses inherent in the substandard portfolio.\nBesides the change above, the Company has not made any\nmaterial changes in the accounting methodology used to\nrecord the ALLL during the past three years.\nBased on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company\ndoes not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there\nwill be a material change in the future estimates or\nassumptions used to record the ALLL.\nSee the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section for an\nupdate regarding Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d)\n2016-13 that will impact the accounting methodology used\nto record the ALLL.\nIf actual results are materially different from the judgments\nand uncertainties made, the Company would be required to\nincrease (decrease) its loan provision resulting in a decrease\n(increase) in net income.\nFor example, a 10 basis point increase in our qualitative\nfactors would increase the provision and related ALLL by\n$4 million.\nDescription\nJudgments and\nUncertainties\nRanges over the Last\nThree Years\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nInvestment Securities Impairment:\nPeriodically, the Company may need to assess whether there\nhave been any events or economic circumstances to indicate\nthat a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired\non an other-than- temporary basis.\nIn any such instance, the Company would consider many\nfactors, including the length of time and the extent to which the\nfair value has been less than the amortized cost basis, the market\nliquidity for the security, the financial condition and the near-\nterm prospects of the issuer, expected cash flows, and our intent\nand ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient\nto recover the temporary loss. Securities on which there is an\nunrealized loss that is deemed to be other-than-temporary\nare\nwritten down to fair value, with the write-down recorded as a\nrealized loss in securities gains (losses).\nThe determination of an\ninvestment impairment\ncontains uncertainties\nbecause it requires\nmanagement to make\nassumptions and\njudgments regarding\nfuture uncollectible\namounts based on\ninvestments that have a\nlower market value than\nbook value within the\nsecurity portfolio.\nDuring 2021, an equity\nsecurity acquired in\npartial satisfaction of\ndebts previously\ncontracted was sold at a\nloss of $6 million.\nThe Company has not made any material changes in the\naccounting methodology used to evaluate whether an\ninvestment is other-than-temporarily impaired during the\npast three years.\nBased on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company\ndoes not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there\nwill be a material change in the future estimates or\nassumptions used to record impaired securities.\nSee the Recent Accounting Pronouncements section for an\nupdate regarding ASU 2016-13 that will impact the\naccounting methodology used to record other-than-\ntemporary impairments on securities.\nIf actual results are materially different from the judgments\nand uncertainties made, the Company would be required to\nimpair the associated securities, resulting in a decline in net\nincome, other comprehensive income, or both.\nDescription\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nRanges over the Last\nThree Years\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nDeferred Tax Asset:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in\naccordance with income tax accounting\nguidance. Accordingly, we record a net\ndeferred tax asset or liability based on the tax\neffects of the differences between the\nbook and tax bases of assets and liabilities. If\ncurrently available information indicates it is\nmore likely than not\u201d that the net deferred\ntax asset will not be realized, a valuation\nallowance is established. Net deferred tax\nassets are measured using enacted tax rates\nexpected to apply to taxable income in the\nyears in which those temporary differences\nare expected to be recovered or settled.\nThe Company exercises significant\njudgment in evaluating the amount\nand timing of recognition of the\nresulting tax liabilities and assets.\nThese judgments and estimates are\ninherently subjective and reviewed\non a continual basis as regulatory\nand business factors change. Any\nreduction in estimated future\ntaxable income may require us to\nrecord a valuation allowance\nagainst our new deferred tax asset.\nA valuation allowance would result\nin additional income tax expense in\nsuch period, which would\nnegatively affect earnings.\nEffective Tax Rate:\n2019: 13%\n2020: 18%\n2021: 20%\nThe Company is subject to various state tax rates that impact the\noverall effective tax rate. Changes in income earned in various\nstates may increase or decrease the effective tax rate in the future.\nBased on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company does\nnot believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a\nmaterial change in the future estimates or assumptions used to\nrecord the deferred tax asset.\nIn the event the Company was required to change the effective tax\nrate used to calculate the deferred tax asset, a rate decrease would\nresult in a lower deferred tax asset and net income while a rate\nincrease would result in a higher deferred tax asset and net income.\nFor example, if the effective tax rate was reduced by 1% as of\nDecember 31, 2021, a $779 thousand decrease in our deferred tax\nasset and an increase to the Company's tax expense of the same\namount would occur.\nDescription\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nRanges over the Last\nThree Years\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement\ndefines fair value as the price that would be\nreceived to sell a financial asset or paid to\ntransfer a financial liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date.\nThe degree of management\njudgment involved in determining\nthe fair value of assets and\nliabilities is dependent upon the\navailability of quoted market prices\nor observable market parameters.\nFor financial instruments that trade\nactively and have quoted market\nprices or observable market\nparameters, there is minimal\nsubjectivity involved in measuring\nfair value. When observable market\nprices and parameters are not\navailable, management judgment is\nnecessary to estimate fair value. In\naddition, changes in market\nconditions may reduce the\navailability of quoted prices or the\nobservable date.\nThe Company has not made any material changes in the accounting\nmethodology used to evaluate the fair market value of assets or\nliabilities when observable market prices and parameters are not\navailable and management judgment is necessary.\nBased on current applicable GAAP guidance, the Company does\nnot believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a\nmaterial change in the future estimates or assumptions used to\nrecord the fair market value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Company's investment portfolio, derivatives, impaired loans,\nassets held-for-sale and foreclosed assets require management's\njudgment to determine the asset's value.\nIn the event the Company was required to decrease (increase) the\ninvestment portfolio's fair value, the result would be a decline\n(increase) in total assets, OCI, and AOCI.\nImpaired loans impact the ALLL.

We intend to\nexecute our strategic plan through the following:\n\u2022\nContinue organic growth;\n\u2022\nSelectively pursue opportunities to expand through acquisitions or\nnew market development;\n\u2022\nAttract and develop talent;\n\u2022\nImprove financial performance;\n\u2022\nMaintain a branch-lite business model with strategically placed locations; and\n\u2022\nLeverage technology to enhance the client experience and improve profitability.\nPerformance Measures\nAs of or for the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nReturn on average assets\n1.24\n%\n0.24\n%\n0.63\n%\nReturn on average equity\n10.84\n%\n2.05\n%\n5.38\n%\nEarnings per share\n(1)\n$\n1.35\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.59\nDiluted earnings per share\n(1)\n$\n1.33\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.58\nEfficiency\n(2)\n54.50\n%\n58.13\n%\n58.37\n%\nEquity to assets\n11.88\n%\n11.03\n%\n12.20\n%\n(1)\nRetroactively adjusted per share figures to account for\na two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend, whereby each holder of\nour common stock received one additional share of common stock for each share owned as of the record date of December 19, 2018.\n(2)\nWe calculate efficiency ratio as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.\n2021 Highlights:\n\u25cf\nNet income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $69\nmillion, an increase of $57 million or 451% from the prior\nyear ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nTotal assets were $5.6 billion primarily made up of $4.3 billion in loans and\n$746 million in available-for-sale securities.\n\u25cf\nImproved our fiscal year efficiency ratio from 58.13% in 2020 to\n54.50% in 2021.\n\u25cf\nPurchased 1,530,357 or $22 million of outstanding shares as part of the share\nrepurchase programs in 2021.\n\u25cf\nExpanded into Phoenix, Arizona.\n\u25cf\nIncreased tangible book value per share to $13.23 at December 31, 2021\ncompared to $12.08 at December 31, 2020.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, economic\nuncertainty and a disruption to the financial markets, the\nduration and extent of which is not currently known. A discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its\noperations and measures undertaken by the Company in response thereto is provided\nbelow.\nBank Operations\nThe Company has a business continuity plan to mitigate operational risks in unusual,\nunexpected events. The plan identifies key\ncomponents of our operations and creates responses to ensure normal operations\ncontinue and to minimize the effects of potential loss. We\nimplemented the business continuity procedures in March 2020\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, substantially all\nemployees returned to on-premises work. In addition, a hybrid work\nopportunity was created for most employees. No material interruptions\nto our business operations have occurred to date.\nPaycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) Lending Facility\nThe PPP was established by the CARES Act and authorized forgivable loans to small businesses. The Consolidated Appropriations\nAct of 2021 allocated additional PPP funding. The Bank provided PPP loans to support current customers and foster relationships with new\ncustomers. The loans earned interest at 1%, included fees between 1% and 5% and typically matured\nin two or five years. The loans\noriginated under the PPP received a 0% risk weight under the regulatory capital rules which resulted\nin increased Common Equity Tier 1,\nTier 1, and Tier 2 capital ratios, but the PPP loans are included in the calculation of our Leverage ratio.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the PPP loans on our 2021 and 2020 financials:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPPP Loan Activity\nOutstanding loan balance, beginning\n$\n292,230\n$\n-\nLoan increases\n133,778\n369,260\nLoan payoffs\n(361,203)\n(77,030)\nOutstanding loan balance, end\n$\n64,805\n$\n292,230\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPPP Loan Fee Activity\nUnearned fee balance, beginning\n$\n4,189\n$\n-\nUnearned fees added\n5,062\n9,946\nEarned fees recognized\n(7,568)\n(5,757)\nUnearned fee balance, end\n$\n1,683\n$\n4,189\n\u2020 Earned fees include fees earned from loans forgiven and monthly amortization\nfees on loans outstanding.\nLoan Modifications\nThe CARES Act as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, allowed financial institutions to elect to suspend GAAP\nprinciples and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating\nto the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise require evaluation\nas troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d) from March 1, 2020 to January\n2, 2022 as long as the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of\nDecember 31, 2019. The Company elected to use this guidance and started the modified\nloan process during the first quarter of 2020. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company had 6 loans with an outstanding balance\nof $17 million that were still under these modified terms.\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) Implementation\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments.\u201d\nTopic 326 replaces the incurred loss model for determining the allowance\nfor credit losses ( ACL\u201d),\nformerly presented as the allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d).\nThe CECL approach requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses\nexpected to occur over the estimated remaining life of the asset. As a result, the new approach may accelerate the recording\nof credit losses\ncompared to the former, incurred loss model. The new standard does not change the\ncredit risk of the Company's loans or the ultimate losses\nincurred by the Company on those loans. Topic 326 may result in increased volatility in the Company's\nnet income and capital levels due to\nchanges in the reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic\nconditions on a quarterly basis.\nFor information regarding our implementation process, refer to\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company adopted Topic 326 through a modified retrospective approach\nthat results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained\nearnings as of the day of adoption. The Company anticipates the January 1, 2022 ACL to be between $55 million and $61 million compared\nto $58 million as of December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, CECL applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as unfunded lines of credit, financial\nguarantees not accounted\nfor as derivatives, and other unfunded loan commitments. The expected credit loss liability\nfor off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated\nover the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit\nrisk unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer.\nThe credit loss estimate for off-balance sheet credit exposure considers the\nlikelihood that funding will occur and if funded, the related\nestimate of expected credit losses. Changes in the estimated credit loss are reported\nin the statement of income and the expected credit loss\nestimate for unfunded commitments is reported as a liability on the balance\nsheet. Once a loan is funded, the expected credit loss for off-\nbalance sheet exposures will be transferred to the ACL.\nThe Company expects to record a $4 million to $8 million credit loss liability for\noff-balance sheet credit exposures. The credit loss\nliability will result in a decrease to retained earnings, net of the deferred tax\nasset.\nThe change in the required ACL is primarily a result of: (i) consolidation of previously disaggregated loan pools, (ii) an increase in\nthe\nlookback period, and (iii) incorporation of reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Under the incurred loss model, the Company disaggregated\nloans by risk ratings and loan categories. Under the CECL model, the Company's pools were reduced\nand did not sub-segment by risk rating.\nThe change in the Company's loan pools is expected to decrease the required\nreserve as of January 1, 2022. The incurred loss model's look-\nback period was short compared to the CECL methodology that requires the use of a full economic cycle. The change in the\nlook-back period\nis expected to decrease the required reserve. The application of forward-looking\nguidance is new under the CECL methodology. The\nCompany uses the unemployment rate guidance provided by the Federal\nReserve and reverts to an average unemployment rate outside of the\nforecast periods. The change in methodology does not materially impact the Company's loans\nthat were impaired as of December 31, 2021.\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable\nby the Company will be driven by: (i) The type of loan\ncommitment which are grouped using the same loan pools for the loan portfolio.\nFor example, the expected funding of residential\nconstruction loans is expected to be higher than funding for energy loans; (ii)\nchanges in historical loss rates; (iii) qualitative factors;\nand (iv)\naverage utilization rates.\nTopic 326 eliminates the other than temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) methodology\non available-for-sale securities. The OTTI method\nis replaced with an allowance and related credit loss expense. This allows subsequent increases in\nfair market value of the security to be\nrecognized by reducing the allowance and reversing previous credit loss expense\nrecorded. The Company's available-for-sale securities were\nnot materially impacted by Topic 326's implementation.\nWe anticipate the implementation of Topic 326 will not have a material impact on our capital ratios. The Federal\nReserve System, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency adopted a joint final rule for an optional phase-in\nperiod of three years for banks to absorb the impact to regulatory capital\nof implementing the new CECL standard. For the first year of the\ntransition, the Company may reduce the impact of CECL on retained earnings by 75%. For years two\nand three, the regulatory capital\nschedules would continue to be adjusted based on declining amount of 25% each\nyear.\nCustomer and Industry Concentrations\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's top 20 customer relationships, represented\napproximately 27% or $1.2 billion of total\ndeposits. The majority of the $1.2 billion are money market deposit accounts. The Company believes\nthat there are sufficient funding\nsources, including on-balance sheet liquid assets and wholesale deposit\noptions, so that an immediate reduction in these deposit balances\nwould not be expected to have a detrimental effect on the Company's financial\nposition or operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, a significant portion of the\nCompany's ATM and credit card interchange income was driven by\ncompanies that mobilized their workforce directly impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These companies represented $5 million or 61% of\nthe $8 million in ATM and credit card interchange income. We anticipate that the related non-interest income will fluctuate in the near term\nbased on COVID-19 pandemic.\nUpdate to 2021 Events Discussed in the Previous 10-K\nFour of our branches are in areas that were impacted by severe, cold weather conditions\nin February and March of 2021. One branch\nsustained water damage but did not impact operations or our ability to support\nour customers. In 2021, the Company repaired and replaced\nthe property and equipment impacted by the water damage. The related cost was primarily\npaid for by our insurance provider.\nDiscussion and Analysis - Results\nof Operations\nNet Interest Income\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest\nincome is the difference between the amounts\nreceived on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing\nliabilities. Net interest income is impacted by internal and\nexternal factors including:\n\u2022\nChanges in the volume, rate, and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities;\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and\neconomic conditions; and\n\u2022\nChanges in credit quality.\nWe present and discuss net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. A tax-equivalent basis presents all income taxable at the same\nrate. For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126.58,\nan amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax\nrate of 21% would yield $100. We believe a tax-equivalent basis provides for\nimproved comparability between the various earning assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 to the second quarter of 2019,\nwe operated in a rising interest rate environment. Our\nyield on earning assets and cost of funds were driven by the rate environment. In\nJuly 2019, interest rates started to decline and continued\nthrough 2021. Our earning assets repriced quicker than our cost of funds, resulting\nin a lower net interest margin in 2019 and 2020. During\n2021, the Company benefited from changes in our deposit mix, including\nan increase in non-interest-bearing deposits and a reduction in time\ndeposits that improved our overall cost of funds. The reduced cost of funds was offset by reductions\nin earning-asset yields. A table showing\nour three-year yield on earning assets and cost of funds is presented below:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nYield on securities - tax equivalent\n(1)\n2.90\n%\n3.05\n%\n3.35\n%\nYield on loans\n4.02\n4.26\n5.52\nYield on earning assets - tax equivalent\n(1)\n3.60\n3.96\n5.04\nCost of interest-bearing deposits\n0.49\n1.02\n2.21\nCost of total deposits\n0.40\n0.85\n1.89\nCost of FHLB and short-term borrowings\n2.09\n1.56\n1.90\nCost of funds\n0.50\n0.92\n1.90\nNet interest margin - tax equivalent\n(1)\n3.15\n%\n3.13\n%\n3.31\n%\n(1)\nTax-exempt income is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis.

The incremental tax rate used is\n21%.\n(2)\nThe change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the respective absolute dollar amounts of the change in\nvolume or rate.\nInterest Income -\nInterest income declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in 2020. Lower\nyields on earning assets were driven by a decline in the interest rate environment\nin the first half of 2020 which persisted in 2021 and\nincreased competition driven by a surge in deposits in 2021. The decline in asset yields was partially\noffset by year-over-year loan growth\nand PPP loan income. PPP loan fees and interest income improved the earning asset yield by 4 basis points for the year ended December\n31,\n2021.\nThe Company currently anticipates loan yields to increase in 2022 due to anticipated rate hikes\nby the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nInterest Expense -\nInterest expense declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in 2020. The\ncost of interest-bearing deposits declined due to strategic rate changes in our\ndeposit products driven by the declining rate environment. The\naverage volume for interest-bearing deposits declined primarily because\nof time deposit maturities and current rates on time deposits.\nAverage FHLB and other borrowings declined compared to 2020, as the\nCompany's increase in cash offset the need to renew or increase\nthese borrowings. The increase in the cost of FHLB borrowings was the result of $771 thousand in prepayment\npenalties related to $40\nmillion of FHLB borrowings. In addition, the increase in the cost of funds was impacted\nby short-term duration borrowings with lower rates\nthat matured in 2020 and were not renewed. We currently anticipate our cost of funds will increase\ndue to expected increases in the interest\nrate environment although that may be offset by a greater mix of non-interest-bearing\ndeposits based on current trends.\nNet Interest Income -\nNet interest income increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in\n2020.\nThe increase in net interest income was driven by reductions in interest-bearing deposit rates as well as\na reduction in time deposits\nwhich was partially offset by lower rates on earning assets. Reductions in\nearning asset yields were offset by reductions in the cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities that resulted in a $747 thousand increase in net\ninterest income.\nWe currently expect the net interest margin to\nremain flat or slightly increase in 2022 as the Company anticipates earning\nassets to reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a rising\nrate environment.\nOur expected margin may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, placing\nloans on non-accrual status,\nincluding loans with deferred payments, and changes in competition.\n$3,679\n$6,083\n$8,707\n$11,733\n$13,660\n0.15%\n0.17%\n0.19%\n0.22%\n0.24%\nNoninterest Income Trend (dollars in thousands)\nTotal noninterest income\nNoninterest income to average assets\nImpact of Transition\nAway from LIBOR\nThe Company had more than $1.3\nbillion in loans tied to LIBOR at December 31, 2021. Starting in October 2021,\nthe Company began\nlimiting loans originated using the LIBOR index. For current borrowers,\nthe Company is modifying loan document language to account for\nthe transition away from LIBOR as loans renew or originate. The Company\nplans to replace LIBOR-based loans with the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate ( SOFR\u201d).\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2020-04 Reference\nRate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation\nof the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d in 2020. The ASU allows the\nCompany to recognize the modification related to LIBOR as a\ncontinuation of the old contract, rather than a cancellation of the old contract\nresulting in a write-off of unamortized fees and creation\nof a\nnew contract.\nNoninterest Income\nThe components of noninterest income were as follows for the periods shown:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService charges and fees on customer accounts\n$\n4,580\n$\n2,803\n$\n1,777\n%\nRealized gains on available-for-sale securities\n1,023\n1,704\n(681)\n(40)\nGains (losses), net on equity securities\n(6,325)\n(6,372)\n(13,558)\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance\n3,483\n1,809\n1,674\nSwap fees and credit valuation adjustments, net\n(204)\n(235)\nATM and credit card interchange income\n7,996\n4,379\n3,617\nOther non-interest income\n2,628\n1,195\n1,433\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n13,660\n$\n11,733\n$\n1,927\n%\nThe changes in noninterest income were driven by the following:\nService charges and fees on customer accounts -\nThis category includes account analysis fees offset by a customer\nrebate program. The\nincrease for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020\nwas driven by a decline in costs associated with our rebate program,\nincluding a reduction in the funded balance and reduction in rates used. In\naddition, customer growth and an increase in outstanding balances\nimproved account analysis fees.\nRealized gains on available-for-sale securities -\nThe Company sells available-for-sale securities for strategic reasons including\ncapitalizing\non attractive market conditions, improving the credit quality of the security portfolio,\nor for tax purposes,\nprimarily to offset capital losses.\nThe realized gains on available-for-sale securities declined from 2020\nto 2021 primarily due to a lower number of securities being sold. In\n2020,\nsales were made to capitalize on attractive market conditions and improve credit\nquality.\nIn 2021, the Company sold securities for tax\npurposes and to capitalize on attractive market conditions.\nGains (losses), net on equity securities -\nDuring 2021, the Company recorded a $6 million loss related to an\nequity investment received as\npart of a modified loan agreement in 2020. The Company elected to account for this security at cost\nless impairment, unless an orderly\ntransaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer occurred that\nwould result in an updated fair market value. During 2021,\nsignificant adverse changes in market conditions for the investment resulted in\nthe investment being sold below its book value. Refer to the\nEquity Securities\u201d section in\nNote 3: Securities\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance -\nThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared\nto 2020 was due to the Company\nrecognizing $2 million in tax-free death benefits from a bank-owned life insurance poli\ncy in 2021 compared to $0 of such proceeds for 2020.\nSwap fee income, net -\nSwap fee income, net, includes both swap fees from the execution of new\nswaps and the credit valuation adjustment\n( CVA\u201d). Swap fees on new swaps depend on the size and term of the underlying\nasset. During 2020, a borrower with a back-to-back swap\nwas downgraded and resulted in a $300 thousand loss related to the CVA. During\n2021, the same borrower chose to eliminate its back-to-\nback swap, resulting in reversal of the CVA adjustment made in 2020.\nATM and credit card interchange income -\nThe increase in ATM and credit card interchange income for the year ended December 31,\ncompared to 2020 was primarily the result of customers that mobilized their workforce directly\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company anticipates the credit card activity and related income will continue\nto fluctuate in connection with changes in COVID-19\ncases and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\nOther non-interest income -\nThe increase in other non-interest income for the year ended December\n31, 2021 compared to 2020 was\nprimarily related to a $809 thousand increase in state employment incentives\nreceived during 2021. We expect to continue to receive the\nincentives quarterly going forward for three years, but at significantly lower\namounts. The Company also saw a $374 thousand increase in\nletter of credit and foreign exchange fees for the period ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to 2020.\n61%\n10%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n0%\n17%\n58%\n9%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n7%\n14%\nSalary & benefits\nOccupancy\nDeposit insurance\nProfessional fees\nSoftware &\ncommunication\nGoodwill\nimpairment\nOther\nBreakout of Noninterest Expense\n12/31/2021\n12/31/2020\n$62,089\n$85,755\n$87,640\n$99,968\n$99,382\n2.53%\n2.45%\n1.95%\n1.87%\n1.78%\nNoninterest Expense (dollars in thousands)\nTotal noninterest expense\nNoninterest expense to average assets\nNoninterest Expense\nThe components of noninterest expense were as follows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalary and employee benefits\n$\n61,080\n$\n57,747\n$\n3,333\n%\nOccupancy\n9,688\n8,701\nProfessional fees\n3,519\n4,218\n(699)\n(17)\nDeposit insurance premiums\n3,705\n4,301\n(596)\n(14)\nData processing\n2,878\n2,719\nAdvertising\n2,090\n1,219\nSoftware and communication\n4,234\n3,750\nForeclosed assets, net\n1,239\n(542)\n(44)\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n7,397\n(7,397)\n(100)\nOther non-interest expense\n11,491\n8,677\n2,814\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n99,382\n$\n99,968\n$\n(586)\n(1)\n%\nThe changes in noninterest expense were driven by the following:\nSalary and Employee Benefits -\nSalary and employee benefit costs increased for the year ended December\n31, 2021\ncompared to 2020\nprimarily due to increased hiring for market expansion and an increase in\nanticipated payouts for performance-based awards that resulted\nfrom improved earnings and asset quality metrics. In addition, the Company\nrecognized $719 thousand in expense during 2021 due to\naccelerated vesting of stock-based awards and the annual incentive award\nof a former employee. We currently anticipate salary and employee\nbenefit costs to increase in 2022 due to new market locations, merit increases and\nadditional hiring.\nOccupancy -\nOccupancy costs increased for the period ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to 2020 primarily due to our new locations in\nthe rapidly growing Frisco, Texas market and Phoenix, Arizona market and our more prominent location on\nthe Country Club Plaza, in\nKansas City, Missouri.\nWe currently anticipate occupancy costs to increase slightly in 2022\nas a result of an additional location in the Dallas\nmarket.\nProfessional Fees -\nProfessional fees decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same corresponding period in 2020\nprimarily from a reduction in legal fees related to PPP loan originations and loan workouts.\nDeposit Insurance Premiums -\nThe FDIC uses a risk-based premium system to calculate the quarterly fee.\nOur costs fluctuate because\nof changes in asset growth, changes in asset quality and changes in capital ratios.\nDuring 2021, the Company benefited from improved\nearnings that increased average tangible equity while average assets remained\nflat between 2020 and 2021.\nAdvertising -\nThe\nincrease in advertising costs was driven by increased in-person events for the year\nended December 31, 2021 compared\nto 2020 because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions being lifted.\nSoftware and Communication -\nThe increase was driven by our continued strategy to invest in technologies that allow us to cover\nbeginning-to-end loan originations, provide customers with a suite of online tools\nand analyze operational trends. In addition to the growing\nnumber of technologies implemented, a portion of the increase in costs was due\nto our growth. We currently anticipate our software and\ncommunication costs to increase in 2022 as we continue adding and implementing\nnew software products that improve our customer's\nexperience.\nForeclosed Assets, net -\nThe decrease in foreclosed assets, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020\nresulted from the\nCompany selling a commercial use facility foreclosed upon in 2020 during\n2021 at a loss that was slightly offset by the sale of raw land\nacquired in 2019 at a gain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nCompany sold industrial facilities acquired in 2019 that resulted in\na $844 thousand loss and impaired raw land acquired in 2019.\nGoodwill Impairment -\nThe Company performed an interim review for goodwill impairment in 2020. A quantitative review was\nperformed on the Tulsa market reporting unit and resulted in a $7 million impairment.\nRefer to\nNote 6: Goodwill and Core Deposit\nIntangible\nwithin the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information.\nOther noninterest expense -\nYear-over-year changes included a $2 million increase in commercial\ncard costs as a result of our growing\ncustomer base and increased use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, insured cash sweep ( ICS\u201d) deposits increased in 2021\nfrom 2020, which drove related fees higher.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would\nbe calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily from\ninvestments in tax advantaged assets, such as bank-owned life insurance\nand tax-exempt municipal securities, state tax credits and permanent\ntax differences from equity-based compensation. Detail behind the differences\nbetween the statutory rate and effective tax rate for the years\nended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is provided in\nNote 11: Income Taxes\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe December 31, 2020 effective tax rate increase from December 31,\n2019 was due to the non-taxable, goodwill impairment in 2020\nand a state tax credit received in 2019. The 2021 income tax expense was impacted\nby a $71.7 million increase in income before income\ntaxes that increased taxes at the statutory rate by $15 million. The tax-exempt benefit diminishes\nas the Company's ratio of taxable income to\ntax-exempt income increases. We currently anticipate the effective tax rate to increase slightly\nin 2022. A three-year trend of our income tax\nand effective tax rate is presented below:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n$\n17,556\n$\n2,713\n$\n4,138\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n86,969\n$\n15,314\n$\n32,611\nEffective tax rate\n%\n%\n%\nDiscussion and Analysis - Financial\nCondition\nLoan Portfolio\nLoans represent our largest portion of earning assets and typically provide higher\nyields than other assets. The quality and\ndiversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when\nreviewing our financial condition. We established an internal loan\npolicy that outlines a standard lending philosophy and provides consistent direction\nto achieve goals and objectives, which include\nmaximizing earnings over the short and long term by managing risks through\nthe policy. Internal concentration limits exist on all loans,\nincluding commercial real estate, energy, and land development. We established strong\nunderwriting practices and procedures to assess our\nborrowers, including review of debt service, collateral value and evaluation\nof guarantors. We also engage third-parties to independently\nreview our loan portfolio. Appropriate actions are taken when a borrower is no longer able to service its debt.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, primarily made up of commercial\nand commercial real estate loans. Commercial\nloans are generally paid back through normal business operations. Commercial\nreal estate loans, which include both construction and limited\nterm financing are typically paid back through normal income from operations,\nthe sale of the underlying property or refinancing by other\ninstitutional sources. Most of our loans are made to borrowers within the states we operate,\nwhich include Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,\nArizona and Texas. In addition, we occasionally invest in syndicated shared national credits and loan\nparticipations.\nGross loans, net of unearned income declined $186 million from the prior\nyear to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our\ncommercial loan portfolio increased by $63 million or 5% as a result of\napproximately $678 million in loan originations and drawdowns that\nwere able to offset commercial loan paydowns.\nOur commercial real estate loans experienced growth of $102 million or 9%. This was driven\nby strong originations of approximately $318 million and approximately\n$108 million of loans that completed construction and were\ntransferred into our commercial real estate portfolio from the construction\nand land development portfolio.\nResidential and multifamily real\nestate decreased $80 million or 12% driven by payoffs of several, larger credit facilities.\nEnergy loans decreased $66 million or 19%\nprimarily due to paydowns on outstanding lines of credit and management's strategy\nto lower our energy loan concentration. Gross loans\nincluded $65 million and $292 million of PPP loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, loan yields\ndeclined to 4.02% compared to 4.26% in the prior year, primarily as a result\nof lower interest rates from adjustable rate loan movements in\nLIBOR and Prime.\nAs of December 31, 2021, PPP loans made up approximately 1% of the total portfolio, representing\n$65 million in loans.

We are\ncommitted to a culture of serving our clients in extraordinary ways by providing\npersonalized, relationship-based banking. We believe that\nsuccess is achieved through establishing and growing the trust of our\nclients, employees, stakeholders, and communities.\nDuring 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic allowed us to serve our\ncustomers by providing PPP loan funding, modifying loans through\npayment deferrals and rate adjustments, and using our\ntechnology to reduce contact exposure. Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nin 2021, we remain focused on growth and building stockholder value\nthrough greater efficiency and increased profitability. We intend to\nexecute our strategic plan through the following:\n\u2022\nContinue organic growth;\n\u2022\nSelectively pursue opportunities to expand through acquisitions or\nnew market development;\n\u2022\nAttract and develop talent;\n\u2022\nImprove financial performance;\n\u2022\nMaintain a branch-lite business model with strategically placed locations; and\n\u2022\nLeverage technology to enhance the client experience and improve profitability.\nPerformance Measures\nAs of or for the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nReturn on average assets\n1.24\n%\n0.24\n%\n0.63\n%\nReturn on average equity\n10.84\n%\n2.05\n%\n5.38\n%\nEarnings per share\n(1)\n$\n1.35\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.59\nDiluted earnings per share\n(1)\n$\n1.33\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.58\nEfficiency\n(2)\n54.50\n%\n58.13\n%\n58.37\n%\nEquity to assets\n11.88\n%\n11.03\n%\n12.20\n%\n(1)\nRetroactively adjusted per share figures to account for\na two-for-one split of our common stock in the form of a stock dividend, whereby each holder of\nour common stock received one additional share of common stock for each share owned as of the record date of December 19, 2018.\n(2)\nWe calculate efficiency ratio as noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.\n2021 Highlights:\n\u25cf\nNet income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 was $69\nmillion, an increase of $57 million or 451% from the prior\nyear ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25cf\nTotal assets were $5.6 billion primarily made up of $4.3 billion in loans and\n$746 million in available-for-sale securities.\n\u25cf\nImproved our fiscal year efficiency ratio from 58.13% in 2020 to\n54.50% in 2021.\n\u25cf\nPurchased 1,530,357 or $22 million of outstanding shares as part of the share\nrepurchase programs in 2021.\n\u25cf\nExpanded into Phoenix, Arizona.\n\u25cf\nIncreased tangible book value per share to $13.23 at December 31, 2021\ncompared to $12.08 at December 31, 2020.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Impact\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, economic\nuncertainty and a disruption to the financial markets, the\nduration and extent of which is not currently known. A discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company and its\noperations and measures undertaken by the Company in response thereto is provided\nbelow.\nBank Operations\nThe Company has a business continuity plan to mitigate operational risks in unusual,\nunexpected events. The plan identifies key\ncomponents of our operations and creates responses to ensure normal operations\ncontinue and to minimize the effects of potential loss. We\nimplemented the business continuity procedures in March 2020\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, substantially all\nemployees returned to on-premises work. In addition, a hybrid work\nopportunity was created for most employees. No material interruptions\nto our business operations have occurred to date.\nPaycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d) Lending Facility\nThe PPP was established by the CARES Act and authorized forgivable loans to small businesses. The Consolidated Appropriations\nAct of 2021 allocated additional PPP funding. The Bank provided PPP loans to support current customers and foster relationships with new\ncustomers. The loans earned interest at 1%, included fees between 1% and 5% and typically matured\nin two or five years. The loans\noriginated under the PPP received a 0% risk weight under the regulatory capital rules which resulted\nin increased Common Equity Tier 1,\nTier 1, and Tier 2 capital ratios, but the PPP loans are included in the calculation of our Leverage ratio.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of the PPP loans on our 2021 and 2020 financials:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPPP Loan Activity\nOutstanding loan balance, beginning\n$\n292,230\n$\n-\nLoan increases\n133,778\n369,260\nLoan payoffs\n(361,203)\n(77,030)\nOutstanding loan balance, end\n$\n64,805\n$\n292,230\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nPPP Loan Fee Activity\nUnearned fee balance, beginning\n$\n4,189\n$\n-\nUnearned fees added\n5,062\n9,946\nEarned fees recognized\n(7,568)\n(5,757)\nUnearned fee balance, end\n$\n1,683\n$\n4,189\n\u2020 Earned fees include fees earned from loans forgiven and monthly amortization\nfees on loans outstanding.\nLoan Modifications\nThe CARES Act as extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, allowed financial institutions to elect to suspend GAAP\nprinciples and regulatory determinations for loan modifications relating\nto the COVID-19 pandemic that would otherwise require evaluation\nas troubled debt restructurings ( TDR\u201d) from March 1, 2020 to January\n2, 2022 as long as the loan was not more than 30 days past due as of\nDecember 31, 2019. The Company elected to use this guidance and started the modified\nloan process during the first quarter of 2020. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company had 6 loans with an outstanding balance\nof $17 million that were still under these modified terms.\nCurrent Expected Credit Loss ( CECL\u201d) Implementation\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic\n326): Measurement of Credit\nLosses on Financial Instruments.\u201d\nTopic 326 replaces the incurred loss model for determining the allowance\nfor credit losses ( ACL\u201d),\nformerly presented as the allowance for loan losses ( ALLL\u201d).\nThe CECL approach requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses\nexpected to occur over the estimated remaining life of the asset. As a result, the new approach may accelerate the recording\nof credit losses\ncompared to the former, incurred loss model. The new standard does not change the\ncredit risk of the Company's loans or the ultimate losses\nincurred by the Company on those loans. Topic 326 may result in increased volatility in the Company's\nnet income and capital levels due to\nchanges in the reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic\nconditions on a quarterly basis.\nFor information regarding our implementation process, refer to\nNote 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\u201d\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nThe Company adopted Topic 326 through a modified retrospective approach\nthat results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained\nearnings as of the day of adoption. The Company anticipates the January 1, 2022 ACL to be between $55 million and $61 million compared\nto $58 million as of December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, CECL applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures, such as unfunded lines of credit, financial\nguarantees not accounted\nfor as derivatives, and other unfunded loan commitments. The expected credit loss liability\nfor off-balance sheet credit exposures is estimated\nover the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit\nrisk unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the issuer.\nThe credit loss estimate for off-balance sheet credit exposure considers the\nlikelihood that funding will occur and if funded, the related\nestimate of expected credit losses. Changes in the estimated credit loss are reported\nin the statement of income and the expected credit loss\nestimate for unfunded commitments is reported as a liability on the balance\nsheet. Once a loan is funded, the expected credit loss for off-\nbalance sheet exposures will be transferred to the ACL.\nThe Company expects to record a $4 million to $8 million credit loss liability for\noff-balance sheet credit exposures. The credit loss\nliability will result in a decrease to retained earnings, net of the deferred tax\nasset.\nThe change in the required ACL is primarily a result of: (i) consolidation of previously disaggregated loan pools, (ii) an increase in\nthe\nlookback period, and (iii) incorporation of reasonable and supportable\nforecasts. Under the incurred loss model, the Company disaggregated\nloans by risk ratings and loan categories. Under the CECL model, the Company's pools were reduced\nand did not sub-segment by risk rating.\nThe change in the Company's loan pools is expected to decrease the required\nreserve as of January 1, 2022. The incurred loss model's look-\nback period was short compared to the CECL methodology that requires the use of a full economic cycle. The change in the\nlook-back period\nis expected to decrease the required reserve. The application of forward-looking\nguidance is new under the CECL methodology. The\nCompany uses the unemployment rate guidance provided by the Federal\nReserve and reverts to an average unemployment rate outside of the\nforecast periods. The change in methodology does not materially impact the Company's loans\nthat were impaired as of December 31, 2021.\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable\nby the Company will be driven by: (i) The type of loan\ncommitment which are grouped using the same loan pools for the loan portfolio.\nFor example, the expected funding of residential\nconstruction loans is expected to be higher than funding for energy loans; (ii)\nchanges in historical loss rates; (iii) qualitative factors;\nand (iv)\naverage utilization rates.\nTopic 326 eliminates the other than temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) methodology\non available-for-sale securities. The OTTI method\nis replaced with an allowance and related credit loss expense. This allows subsequent increases in\nfair market value of the security to be\nrecognized by reducing the allowance and reversing previous credit loss expense\nrecorded. The Company's available-for-sale securities were\nnot materially impacted by Topic 326's implementation.\nWe anticipate the implementation of Topic 326 will not have a material impact on our capital ratios. The Federal\nReserve System, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller\nof the Currency adopted a joint final rule for an optional phase-in\nperiod of three years for banks to absorb the impact to regulatory capital\nof implementing the new CECL standard. For the first year of the\ntransition, the Company may reduce the impact of CECL on retained earnings by 75%. For years two\nand three, the regulatory capital\nschedules would continue to be adjusted based on declining amount of 25% each\nyear.\nCustomer and Industry Concentrations\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's top 20 customer relationships, represented\napproximately 27% or $1.2 billion of total\ndeposits. The majority of the $1.2 billion are money market deposit accounts. The Company believes\nthat there are sufficient funding\nsources, including on-balance sheet liquid assets and wholesale deposit\noptions, so that an immediate reduction in these deposit balances\nwould not be expected to have a detrimental effect on the Company's financial\nposition or operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, a significant portion of the\nCompany's ATM and credit card interchange income was driven by\ncompanies that mobilized their workforce directly impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. These companies represented $5 million or 61% of\nthe $8 million in ATM and credit card interchange income. We anticipate that the related non-interest income will fluctuate in the near term\nbased on COVID-19 pandemic.\nUpdate to 2021 Events Discussed in the Previous 10-K\nFour of our branches are in areas that were impacted by severe, cold weather conditions\nin February and March of 2021. One branch\nsustained water damage but did not impact operations or our ability to support\nour customers. In 2021, the Company repaired and replaced\nthe property and equipment impacted by the water damage. The related cost was primarily\npaid for by our insurance provider.\nDiscussion and Analysis - Results\nof Operations\nNet Interest Income\nOur profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest income. Net interest\nincome is the difference between the amounts\nreceived on our interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our interest-bearing\nliabilities. Net interest income is impacted by internal and\nexternal factors including:\n\u2022\nChanges in the volume, rate, and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities;\n\u2022\nChanges in competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies and\neconomic conditions; and\n\u2022\nChanges in credit quality.\nWe present and discuss net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. A tax-equivalent basis presents all income taxable at the same\nrate. For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126.58,\nan amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax\nrate of 21% would yield $100. We believe a tax-equivalent basis provides for\nimproved comparability between the various earning assets.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 to the second quarter of 2019,\nwe operated in a rising interest rate environment. Our\nyield on earning assets and cost of funds were driven by the rate environment. In\nJuly 2019, interest rates started to decline and continued\nthrough 2021. Our earning assets repriced quicker than our cost of funds, resulting\nin a lower net interest margin in 2019 and 2020. During\n2021, the Company benefited from changes in our deposit mix, including\nan increase in non-interest-bearing deposits and a reduction in time\ndeposits that improved our overall cost of funds. The reduced cost of funds was offset by reductions\nin earning-asset yields. A table showing\nour three-year yield on earning assets and cost of funds is presented below:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nYield on securities - tax equivalent\n(1)\n2.90\n%\n3.05\n%\n3.35\n%\nYield on loans\n4.02\n4.26\n5.52\nYield on earning assets - tax equivalent\n(1)\n3.60\n3.96\n5.04\nCost of interest-bearing deposits\n0.49\n1.02\n2.21\nCost of total deposits\n0.40\n0.85\n1.89\nCost of FHLB and short-term borrowings\n2.09\n1.56\n1.90\nCost of funds\n0.50\n0.92\n1.90\nNet interest margin - tax equivalent\n(1)\n3.15\n%\n3.13\n%\n3.31\n%\n(1)\nTax-exempt income is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis.

The following\ntable sets forth the effects of changing rates and\nvolumes on our net interest income during the period shown.

The incremental tax rate used is\n21%.\n(2)\nThe change in interest not due solely to volume or rate has been allocated in proportion to the respective absolute dollar amounts of the change in\nvolume or rate.\nInterest Income -\nInterest income declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in 2020. Lower\nyields on earning assets were driven by a decline in the interest rate environment\nin the first half of 2020 which persisted in 2021 and\nincreased competition driven by a surge in deposits in 2021. The decline in asset yields was partially\noffset by year-over-year loan growth\nand PPP loan income. PPP loan fees and interest income improved the earning asset yield by 4 basis points for the year ended December\n31,\n2021.\nThe Company currently anticipates loan yields to increase in 2022 due to anticipated rate hikes\nby the Federal Open Market\nCommittee.\nInterest Expense -\nInterest expense declined for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in 2020. The\ncost of interest-bearing deposits declined due to strategic rate changes in our\ndeposit products driven by the declining rate environment. The\naverage volume for interest-bearing deposits declined primarily because\nof time deposit maturities and current rates on time deposits.\nAverage FHLB and other borrowings declined compared to 2020, as the\nCompany's increase in cash offset the need to renew or increase\nthese borrowings. The increase in the cost of FHLB borrowings was the result of $771 thousand in prepayment\npenalties related to $40\nmillion of FHLB borrowings. In addition, the increase in the cost of funds was impacted\nby short-term duration borrowings with lower rates\nthat matured in 2020 and were not renewed. We currently anticipate our cost of funds will increase\ndue to expected increases in the interest\nrate environment although that may be offset by a greater mix of non-interest-bearing\ndeposits based on current trends.\nNet Interest Income -\nNet interest income increased for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same period in\n2020.\nThe increase in net interest income was driven by reductions in interest-bearing deposit rates as well as\na reduction in time deposits\nwhich was partially offset by lower rates on earning assets. Reductions in\nearning asset yields were offset by reductions in the cost of\ninterest-bearing liabilities that resulted in a $747 thousand increase in net\ninterest income.\nWe currently expect the net interest margin to\nremain flat or slightly increase in 2022 as the Company anticipates earning\nassets to reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a rising\nrate environment.\nOur expected margin may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, placing\nloans on non-accrual status,\nincluding loans with deferred payments, and changes in competition.\n$3,679\n$6,083\n$8,707\n$11,733\n$13,660\n0.15%\n0.17%\n0.19%\n0.22%\n0.24%\nNoninterest Income Trend (dollars in thousands)\nTotal noninterest income\nNoninterest income to average assets\nImpact of Transition\nAway from LIBOR\nThe Company had more than $1.3\nbillion in loans tied to LIBOR at December 31, 2021. Starting in October 2021,\nthe Company began\nlimiting loans originated using the LIBOR index. For current borrowers,\nthe Company is modifying loan document language to account for\nthe transition away from LIBOR as loans renew or originate. The Company\nplans to replace LIBOR-based loans with the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate ( SOFR\u201d).\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2020-04 Reference\nRate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation\nof the Effects of\nReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d in 2020. The ASU allows the\nCompany to recognize the modification related to LIBOR as a\ncontinuation of the old contract, rather than a cancellation of the old contract\nresulting in a write-off of unamortized fees and creation\nof a\nnew contract.\nNoninterest Income\nThe components of noninterest income were as follows for the periods shown:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nService charges and fees on customer accounts\n$\n4,580\n$\n2,803\n$\n1,777\n%\nRealized gains on available-for-sale securities\n1,023\n1,704\n(681)\n(40)\nGains (losses), net on equity securities\n(6,325)\n(6,372)\n(13,558)\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance\n3,483\n1,809\n1,674\nSwap fees and credit valuation adjustments, net\n(204)\n(235)\nATM and credit card interchange income\n7,996\n4,379\n3,617\nOther non-interest income\n2,628\n1,195\n1,433\nTotal non-interest income\n$\n13,660\n$\n11,733\n$\n1,927\n%\nThe changes in noninterest income were driven by the following:\nService charges and fees on customer accounts -\nThis category includes account analysis fees offset by a customer\nrebate program. The\nincrease for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020\nwas driven by a decline in costs associated with our rebate program,\nincluding a reduction in the funded balance and reduction in rates used. In\naddition, customer growth and an increase in outstanding balances\nimproved account analysis fees.\nRealized gains on available-for-sale securities -\nThe Company sells available-for-sale securities for strategic reasons including\ncapitalizing\non attractive market conditions, improving the credit quality of the security portfolio,\nor for tax purposes,\nprimarily to offset capital losses.\nThe realized gains on available-for-sale securities declined from 2020\nto 2021 primarily due to a lower number of securities being sold. In\n2020,\nsales were made to capitalize on attractive market conditions and improve credit\nquality.\nIn 2021, the Company sold securities for tax\npurposes and to capitalize on attractive market conditions.\nGains (losses), net on equity securities -\nDuring 2021, the Company recorded a $6 million loss related to an\nequity investment received as\npart of a modified loan agreement in 2020. The Company elected to account for this security at cost\nless impairment, unless an orderly\ntransaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer occurred that\nwould result in an updated fair market value. During 2021,\nsignificant adverse changes in market conditions for the investment resulted in\nthe investment being sold below its book value. Refer to the\nEquity Securities\u201d section in\nNote 3: Securities\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance -\nThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared\nto 2020 was due to the Company\nrecognizing $2 million in tax-free death benefits from a bank-owned life insurance poli\ncy in 2021 compared to $0 of such proceeds for 2020.\nSwap fee income, net -\nSwap fee income, net, includes both swap fees from the execution of new\nswaps and the credit valuation adjustment\n( CVA\u201d). Swap fees on new swaps depend on the size and term of the underlying\nasset. During 2020, a borrower with a back-to-back swap\nwas downgraded and resulted in a $300 thousand loss related to the CVA. During\n2021, the same borrower chose to eliminate its back-to-\nback swap, resulting in reversal of the CVA adjustment made in 2020.\nATM and credit card interchange income -\nThe increase in ATM and credit card interchange income for the year ended December 31,\ncompared to 2020 was primarily the result of customers that mobilized their workforce directly\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company anticipates the credit card activity and related income will continue\nto fluctuate in connection with changes in COVID-19\ncases and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\nOther non-interest income -\nThe increase in other non-interest income for the year ended December\n31, 2021 compared to 2020 was\nprimarily related to a $809 thousand increase in state employment incentives\nreceived during 2021. We expect to continue to receive the\nincentives quarterly going forward for three years, but at significantly lower\namounts. The Company also saw a $374 thousand increase in\nletter of credit and foreign exchange fees for the period ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to 2020.\n61%\n10%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n0%\n17%\n58%\n9%\n4%\n4%\n4%\n7%\n14%\nSalary & benefits\nOccupancy\nDeposit insurance\nProfessional fees\nSoftware &\ncommunication\nGoodwill\nimpairment\nOther\nBreakout of Noninterest Expense\n12/31/2021\n12/31/2020\n$62,089\n$85,755\n$87,640\n$99,968\n$99,382\n2.53%\n2.45%\n1.95%\n1.87%\n1.78%\nNoninterest Expense (dollars in thousands)\nTotal noninterest expense\nNoninterest expense to average assets\nNoninterest Expense\nThe components of noninterest expense were as follows for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\nChange\n$\n%\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSalary and employee benefits\n$\n61,080\n$\n57,747\n$\n3,333\n%\nOccupancy\n9,688\n8,701\nProfessional fees\n3,519\n4,218\n(699)\n(17)\nDeposit insurance premiums\n3,705\n4,301\n(596)\n(14)\nData processing\n2,878\n2,719\nAdvertising\n2,090\n1,219\nSoftware and communication\n4,234\n3,750\nForeclosed assets, net\n1,239\n(542)\n(44)\nGoodwill impairment\n-\n7,397\n(7,397)\n(100)\nOther non-interest expense\n11,491\n8,677\n2,814\nTotal non-interest expense\n$\n99,382\n$\n99,968\n$\n(586)\n(1)\n%\nThe changes in noninterest expense were driven by the following:\nSalary and Employee Benefits -\nSalary and employee benefit costs increased for the year ended December\n31, 2021\ncompared to 2020\nprimarily due to increased hiring for market expansion and an increase in\nanticipated payouts for performance-based awards that resulted\nfrom improved earnings and asset quality metrics. In addition, the Company\nrecognized $719 thousand in expense during 2021 due to\naccelerated vesting of stock-based awards and the annual incentive award\nof a former employee. We currently anticipate salary and employee\nbenefit costs to increase in 2022 due to new market locations, merit increases and\nadditional hiring.\nOccupancy -\nOccupancy costs increased for the period ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to 2020 primarily due to our new locations in\nthe rapidly growing Frisco, Texas market and Phoenix, Arizona market and our more prominent location on\nthe Country Club Plaza, in\nKansas City, Missouri.\nWe currently anticipate occupancy costs to increase slightly in 2022\nas a result of an additional location in the Dallas\nmarket.\nProfessional Fees -\nProfessional fees decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021\ncompared to the same corresponding period in 2020\nprimarily from a reduction in legal fees related to PPP loan originations and loan workouts.\nDeposit Insurance Premiums -\nThe FDIC uses a risk-based premium system to calculate the quarterly fee.\nOur costs fluctuate because\nof changes in asset growth, changes in asset quality and changes in capital ratios.\nDuring 2021, the Company benefited from improved\nearnings that increased average tangible equity while average assets remained\nflat between 2020 and 2021.\nAdvertising -\nThe\nincrease in advertising costs was driven by increased in-person events for the year\nended December 31, 2021 compared\nto 2020 because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions being lifted.\nSoftware and Communication -\nThe increase was driven by our continued strategy to invest in technologies that allow us to cover\nbeginning-to-end loan originations, provide customers with a suite of online tools\nand analyze operational trends. In addition to the growing\nnumber of technologies implemented, a portion of the increase in costs was due\nto our growth. We currently anticipate our software and\ncommunication costs to increase in 2022 as we continue adding and implementing\nnew software products that improve our customer's\nexperience.\nForeclosed Assets, net -\nThe decrease in foreclosed assets, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020\nresulted from the\nCompany selling a commercial use facility foreclosed upon in 2020 during\n2021 at a loss that was slightly offset by the sale of raw land\nacquired in 2019 at a gain. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the\nCompany sold industrial facilities acquired in 2019 that resulted in\na $844 thousand loss and impaired raw land acquired in 2019.\nGoodwill Impairment -\nThe Company performed an interim review for goodwill impairment in 2020. A quantitative review was\nperformed on the Tulsa market reporting unit and resulted in a $7 million impairment.\nRefer to\nNote 6: Goodwill and Core Deposit\nIntangible\nwithin the Notes to the Financial Statements for more information.\nOther noninterest expense -\nYear-over-year changes included a $2 million increase in commercial\ncard costs as a result of our growing\ncustomer base and increased use as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, insured cash sweep ( ICS\u201d) deposits increased in 2021\nfrom 2020, which drove related fees higher.\nIncome Taxes\nOur income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would\nbe calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily from\ninvestments in tax advantaged assets, such as bank-owned life insurance\nand tax-exempt municipal securities, state tax credits and permanent\ntax differences from equity-based compensation. Detail behind the differences\nbetween the statutory rate and effective tax rate for the years\nended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is provided in\nNote 11: Income Taxes\nwithin the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe December 31, 2020 effective tax rate increase from December 31,\n2019 was due to the non-taxable, goodwill impairment in 2020\nand a state tax credit received in 2019. The 2021 income tax expense was impacted\nby a $71.7 million increase in income before income\ntaxes that increased taxes at the statutory rate by $15 million. The tax-exempt benefit diminishes\nas the Company's ratio of taxable income to\ntax-exempt income increases. We currently anticipate the effective tax rate to increase slightly\nin 2022.

The quality and\ndiversification of the loan portfolio is an important consideration when\nreviewing our financial condition. We established an internal loan\npolicy that outlines a standard lending philosophy and provides consistent direction\nto achieve goals and objectives, which include\nmaximizing earnings over the short and long term by managing risks through\nthe policy. Internal concentration limits exist on all loans,\nincluding commercial real estate, energy, and land development. We established strong\nunderwriting practices and procedures to assess our\nborrowers, including review of debt service, collateral value and evaluation\nof guarantors. We also engage third-parties to independently\nreview our loan portfolio. Appropriate actions are taken when a borrower is no longer able to service its debt.\nOur loan portfolio consists of various types of loans, primarily made up of commercial\nand commercial real estate loans. Commercial\nloans are generally paid back through normal business operations. Commercial\nreal estate loans, which include both construction and limited\nterm financing are typically paid back through normal income from operations,\nthe sale of the underlying property or refinancing by other\ninstitutional sources. Most of our loans are made to borrowers within the states we operate,\nwhich include Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,\nArizona and Texas. In addition, we occasionally invest in syndicated shared national credits and loan\nparticipations.\nGross loans, net of unearned income declined $186 million from the prior\nyear to $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our\ncommercial loan portfolio increased by $63 million or 5% as a result of\napproximately $678 million in loan originations and drawdowns that\nwere able to offset commercial loan paydowns.\nOur commercial real estate loans experienced growth of $102 million or 9%. This was driven\nby strong originations of approximately $318 million and approximately\n$108 million of loans that completed construction and were\ntransferred into our commercial real estate portfolio from the construction\nand land development portfolio.\nResidential and multifamily real\nestate decreased $80 million or 12% driven by payoffs of several, larger credit facilities.\nEnergy loans decreased $66 million or 19%\nprimarily due to paydowns on outstanding lines of credit and management's strategy\nto lower our energy loan concentration.
