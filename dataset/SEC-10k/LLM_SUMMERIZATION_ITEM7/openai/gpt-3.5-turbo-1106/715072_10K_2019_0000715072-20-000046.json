MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which provides a discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPerformance Overview\nNet income was $167,596 for 2019 compared to $146,920 for 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) were $2.89 and $2.88, respectively, for 2019 compared to $2.80 and $2.79, respectively, for 2018. At December 31, 2019, total assets increased to $13,400,618 from $12,934,878 at December 31, 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and results of operations from 2018 to 2019 has been influenced by a number of factors:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Effective September 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc. ( Brand\u201d) in a transaction valued at $474,453. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2,334,333 which included gross loans with a fair value of $1,580,339, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,859,880, including deposits with a fair value of $1,714,177. The acquisition expanded the Company's footprint in the greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial Highlights\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net interest income increased 11.89% to $443,657 for 2019 as compared to $396,525 for 2018. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to the increase in average earnings assets from the acquisition of Brand and organic growth in the Company's non purchased loan portfolio. Yields on earning assets increased as we replaced maturing assets with assets earning similar or higher rates of interest. Furthermore, the Company capitalized on the rising rate environment over the last two years, ending in July 2019, by replacing maturing loans with new or renewed loans at similar or higher rates. These efforts helped offset the negative impact to our net interest income and net interest margin from not only rising costs of our deposits and borrowings as competition increased in response to the aforementioned rate environment but also the impact of loan yields as rates decreased in the latter half of 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.04% in 2019 compared to 0.05% in 2018. The provision for loan losses was $7,050 for 2019 compared to $6,810 for 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Noninterest income was $153,254 for 2019 compared to $143,961 for 2018. The growth in noninterest income is primarily attributable to the Brand acquisition and growth in our mortgage banking operations. Effective July 1, 2019, we became subject to the limitations on interchange fees imposed pursuant to \u00a71075 of the Dodd-Frank Act (this provision, commonly referred to as the Durbin Amendment,\u201d is discussed in more detail under the heading Supervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business, in this report). The Durbin Amendment limitations reduced interchange fees by approximately $6,000 during the second half of 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Noninterest expense was $374,174 and $345,029 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in noninterest expense and its related components is primarily attributable to the Brand acquisition as well as increases in salaries and employee benefits as the Company engaged in above-average hiring of new production team members over the course of 2019 to support its long term growth strategy. The Company recorded merger expense related to its recent acquisitions of $279 and $14,246 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Merger expense did not impact diluted EPS in 2019, but decreased it by $0.21 in 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Loans, net of unearned income, were $9,689,638 at December 31, 2019 compared to $9,083,129 at December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of 6.68% from the previous year. Excluding purchased loans of $2,101,664 and $2,693,417 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the portfolio increased by $1,198,262, or 18.75%, from December 31, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Deposits totaled $10,213,168 at December 31, 2019 compared to $10,128,557 at December 31, 2018. Noninterest bearing deposits averaged $2,463,436, or 24.19% of average deposits, for 2019 compared to $2,036,754, or 22.83% of average deposits, for 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA historical look at key performance indicators is presented below.

Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions and considers other factors that could impact these estimates. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards, are discussed in further detail in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report. The following discussion details the accounting policies governing some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies\u201d ( ASC 450\u201d), in our loan portfolio. Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310, Receivables\u201d ( ASC 310\u201d). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under ASC 310 and the related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For more information about the considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations, Accounting for Purchased Loans\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. For a purchased loan, no allowance for loan losses is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk. This applies even to a purchased loan with evidence of credit deterioration since origination pursuant to ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d). Generally speaking, rather than carry over an allowance for loan losses, as part of the acquisition we establish a Day 1 Fair Value\u201d of a purchased loan or pools of purchased loans sharing common risk characteristics, which equals the outstanding balance of a purchased loan or pool on the acquisition date less any credit and/or yield discount applied against the purchased loan or pool of loans. In other words, these loans or pools of loans are carried at values which represent our estimate of their future cash flows. After the acquisition date, a purchased loan or pool of loans will either meet or exceed the performance expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values or deteriorate from such expected performance. If the cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased loan or pool of loans decreases from expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values or since our most recent review of such portfolio's performance, then the decrease is recognized as an impairment, and the Company provides for such loan or pool in the provision for loan losses in its consolidated statement of income; ultimately,\nthe Company may partially or fully charge-off the carrying value thereof. If performance expectations are exceeded such that we increase our expectations of cash flows to be collected on the loan or pool, then the Company reverses any previous provision for such loan or pool and, if it continues to exceed expectations subsequent to the reversal of any previously-established provision, then we adjust the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the loan's or pool's remaining life, which has a positive impact on interest income.\nAdditional detail about our loans acquired in connection with our mergers, including our acquisition of Brand, is set forth below under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and in Note 5, Purchased Loans\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc.\nOn September 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition by merger of Brand Group Holdings, Inc. ( Brand\u201d), the parent company of The Brand Banking Company. At closing, Brand merged with and into the Company, with the Company the surviving corporation in the merger; immediately thereafter, The Brand Banking Company merged with and into Renasant Bank, with Renasant Bank being the surviving banking corporation in the merger.

Mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), in the aggregate, comprised approximately 79% of the purchases. CMOs are included in the Mortgage backed securities\u201d line item in the above table. The mortgage backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are issued by government sponsored entities. Obligations of state and political subdivisions comprised approximately 17% of purchases made during 2019. Other debt securities in our investment portfolio consist of corporate debt securities and issuances from the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). The carrying value of securities sold during 2019 totaled $212,137, resulting in a net gain of $348, while proceeds from maturities and calls of securities during 2019 totaled $262,287, which were primarily reinvested in the securities portfolio.\nThe Company successfully implemented several strategic initiatives, collectively referred to as our deleveraging strategy,\u201d to manage its consolidated assets below $10,000,000 at December 31, 2017 in order to delay the impact of the Durbin Amendment. The deleveraging strategy involved the sale of certain investment securities and the shortening of the holding period of mortgage loans held for sale; the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce certain wholesale funding sources. During 2018, we purchased $686,887 in investment securities; the majority of these purchases were made as part of the releveraging of the Company's balance sheet, which was completed in the second quarter of 2018, with the remainder of our purchases being ordinary course purchases of investment securities. Mortgage backed securities and CMOs, in the aggregate, comprised approximately 97% of the purchases. The carrying value of securities sold during 2018 totaled $2,403 resulting in a net loss of $16. Proceeds from maturities and calls of securities during 2018 totaled $160,703, which were primarily reinvested in the securities portfolio. The Brand acquisition in 2018 contributed $71,122 at the acquisition date to the securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2019, unrealized losses of $4,878 were recorded on available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of $364,723. At December 31, 2018, unrealized losses of $18,269 were recorded on available for sale securities with a carrying value of $822,506. The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective securities as scheduled. Accordingly, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFor more information about the Company's trust preferred securities, see Note 3, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale were $318,272 at December 31, 2019 compared to $411,427 at December 31, 2018. Included in the balance at December 31, 2018 is a portfolio of non-mortgage consumer loans of approximately $191,578 acquired from Brand. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company reclassified this portfolio from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. At the time of transfer, the portfolio totaled approximately $134,335. Aside from these loans, loans held for sale primarily consists of residential mortgage loans being held until they are sold on the secondary market.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored entities, and the Company is obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met.

Total deposits were $10,213,168 and $10,128,557 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $2,551,770 and $2,318,706 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $7,661,398 and $7,809,851 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits in 2019 was attributable to organic growth throughout our footprint, as discussed below, and highlights the emphasis the Company has placed on growing core deposits (that is, deposits other than time and public fund deposits). The acquisition of Brand increased total deposits by $1,714,177 at the acquisition date, which consisted of $429,195 and $1,284,982 of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits, respectively.\nManagement continues to focus on growing and maintaining a stable source of funding, specifically noninterest-bearing deposits and other core deposits. Non-interest bearing deposits increased to 24.99% of total deposits at December 31, 2019, as compared to 22.89% of total deposits at December 31, 2018. Under certain circumstances, however, management may elect to acquire non-core deposits in the form of time deposits or public fund deposits (which are deposits of counties, municipalities or other political subdivisions). The source of funds that we select depends on the terms and how those terms assist us in mitigating interest rate risk, maintaining our liquidity position and managing our net interest margin. Accordingly, funds are acquired to meet anticipated funding needs at the rate and with other terms that, in management's view, best address our interest rate risk, liquidity and net interest margin parameters.\nPublic fund deposits may be readily obtained based on the Company's pricing bid in comparison with competitors. Since public fund deposits are obtained through a bid process, these deposit balances may fluctuate as competitive and market forces change. Although the Company has focused on growing stable sources of deposits to reduce reliance on public fund deposits, we participate in the bidding process for these deposits when pricing and other terms make it reasonable under the circumstances given market conditions or when management perceives that other factors, such as the public entity's use of our treasury management or other products and services, make such participation advisable. Our public fund transaction accounts are principally obtained from municipalities including school boards and utilities. Public fund deposits at December 31, 2019 were $1,367,827 compared to $1,271,139 at December 31, 2018.\nLooking at the change in deposits geographically, deposits in our Western Region (which includes corporately managed deposits, such as brokered deposits), Eastern Region and Central Region markets increased $11,121, $85,695 and $53,424, respectively, when compared to December 31, 2018, while deposits in our Northern Region markets decreased $65,629.\nBorrowed Funds\nTotal borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, advances from the FHLB, subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures. Borrowings are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either short-term borrowings or long-term debt. Short-term borrowings have original maturities less than one year and typically include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and short-term FHLB advances. There was $489,091 of short-term borrowings on the balance sheet at December 31, 2019, consisting of security repurchase agreements of $9,091 and short-term borrowings from the FHLB of $480,000, compared to security repurchase agreements of $7,706 and short-term borrowings from the FHLB of $380,000 at December 31, 2018.\nAt December 31, 2019, long-term debt totaled $376,507 compared to $263,618 at December 31, 2018. Long-term FHLB borrowings are used to match-fund against large, fixed rate commercial or real estate loans with long-term maturities, which negates interest rate exposure when rates rise. This was our primary use of long-term FHLB borrowings in 2018 and the first three quarters of 2019; in the fourth quarter of 2019, as interest rates declined following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, we used long-term FHLB borrowings as a source of liquidity in lieu of higher-costing deposits, which had not repriced as quickly following the interest rate cuts. Long-term FHLB advances were $152,337 and $6,690 December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, there were $4 in long-term FHLB advances outstanding scheduled to mature within twelve months or less. The Company had $3,159,942 of availability on unused lines of credit with the FHLB at December 31, 2019 compared to $3,301,543 at December 31, 2018. The weighted-average interest rates on outstanding advances at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 1.53% and 3.28%, respectively.\nThe Company owns the outstanding common securities of business trusts that issued corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities to third-party investors. The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their preferred capital securities and common securities (collectively referred to as capital securities\u201d) to buy floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (or by companies that the Company subsequently acquired). The debentures are the trusts' only assets and interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the capital securities. The Company's junior subordinated debentures totaled $110,215 at December 31, 2019 compared to $109,636 at December 31, 2018. The Company assumed $23,198 of junior subordinated debentures as a result of the acquisition of Brand.\nThe Company owns subordinated notes that, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, totaled $113,955 at December 31, 2019 compared to $147,239 at December 31, 2018. As part of the Brand acquisition, the Company assumed $30,000 of 8.50% fixed rate subordinated notes. We redeemed these notes during the third quarter of 2019 due to the 8.50% fixed interest rate and the fact that their preferential capital treatment began to phase out in 2019. The Company has used the net proceeds from the subordinated notes offerings for general corporate purposes, including providing capital to support the Company's growth organically or through strategic acquisitions, repaying indebtedness and financing investments and capital expenditures, and for investments in the Bank as regulatory capital. The subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 capital under the current regulatory guidelines.\nFor more information about the terms and conditions of the Company's junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes, see Note 13, Long-Term Debt,\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $167,596 compared to net income of $146,920 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.89 as compared to $2.80 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $2.88 as compared to $2.79 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018 and 2019, the Company incurred expenses and charges in connection with certain transactions with respect to which management is unable to accurately predict when these expenses or charges will be incurred or, when incurred, the amount thereof. The following table presents the impact of these expenses and charges on reported earnings per share for the periods presented:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Pre-tax\n</td> <td>After-tax\n</td> <td>Impact to Diluted EPS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Pre-tax\n</td> <td>After-tax\n</td> <td>Impact to Diluted EPS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and conversion expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>1,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt prepayment penalty\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of our net income, comprising 74.59% of total net revenue in 2019. Total net revenue consists of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income. The primary concerns in managing net interest income are the volume, mix and repricing of assets and liabilities.\nNet interest income increased 11.89% to $443,657 for 2019 compared to $396,525 in 2018. On a tax equivalent basis, net interest income increased $47,560 to $449,986 in 2019 as compared to $402,426 in 2018. Net interest margin was 4.08% for 2019 as compared to 4.16% for 2018.\nNet interest income and net interest margin are influenced by internal and external factors. Internal factors include balance sheet changes in volume and mix as well as loan and deposit pricing decisions. External factors include changes in market interest rates, competition and the shape of the interest rate yield curve. As discussed in more detail below, growth in the Company's loan portfolio was the largest contributing factor to the increase in net interest income year over year. The Company capitalized on the rising interest rate environment over the last several years, ending in July 2019, by replacing maturing loans with new or renewed loans at similar or higher rates. These efforts helped offset the negative impact to our net interest income and net interest margin from rising costs of our deposits and borrowings as competition increased in response to the aforementioned interest rate environment.\nInterest income, on a tax equivalent basis, was $548,909 for 2019 compared to $467,755 for 2018, an increase of $81,154.

The increase year over year is a result of the increase in the average balance of loans due to non purchased loan growth and the Brand acquisition, as well as an increase in yield on the loan portfolio.\nInterest income on loans held for sale, on a tax equivalent basis, increased $5,279 to $18,171 in 2019 from $12,892 in 2018. This increase is primarily due to the impact of the portfolio of non-mortgage consumer loans, acquired from Brand and supplemented by additional loans purchased in the second quarter of 2019, that was classified as held for sale until the third quarter of 2019 when the portfolio was reclassified to loans held for investment.

The increase in both deposit expense and cost is attributable to both the increase in the average balance of all interest-bearing deposits resulting from the Brand acquisition and organic deposit growth as well as an increase in the interest rates on interest-bearing deposits. During 2019, the Company continued its efforts to grow noninterest-bearing deposits, resulting in an increase of $233,064. Although the Company continues to seek changes in the mix of its deposits from higher costing time deposits to lower costing interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing deposits, rates offered on the Company's interest-bearing deposit accounts, including time deposits, have increased to match competitive market interest rates in order to maintain stable sources of funding.\nInterest expense on total borrowings was $16,928 and $15,569 for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, while the cost of total borrowings was 4.17% and 4.01% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company assumed subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures in its acquisition of Brand, increasing the rate and mix of higher costing long-term borrowings. Additional interest expense from these assumed notes, coupled with higher interest rates charged on our short-term FHLB advances as rates rose through July 2019, resulted in the increase to interest expense and cost of total borrowings.\nA more detailed discussion of the cost of our funding sources is set forth below under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in this item.

While the acquisition of Brand boosted the growth of our noninterest income, our continued focus on diversification of our income streams also resulted in an increase in nearly all of the Company's components of noninterest income, some of which was offset by the impact of the Durbin Amendment.\nService charges on deposit accounts include maintenance fees on accounts, per item charges, account enhancement charges for additional packaged benefits and overdraft fees. Service charges on deposit accounts were $35,972 and $34,660 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Overdraft fees, the largest component of service charges on deposits, decreased to $23,097 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $24,105 for the same period in 2018.\nFees and commissions decreased to $19,430 in 2019 as compared to $23,868 for the same period in 2018. Fees and commissions include fees related to deposit services, such as ATM fees and interchange fees on debit card transactions. Interchange fees on debit card transactions, the largest component of fees and commissions, were $15,352 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $20,390 for the same period in 2018. Effective July 1, 2019, we became subject to the limitations on interchange fees imposed pursuant to the Durbin Amendment. The Durbin Amendment limitations reduced interchange fees by approximately $6,000 over the last half of 2019. Management is continuing to develop and enhance strategies to offset this impact.\nThrough Renasant Insurance, we offer a range of commercial and personal insurance products through major insurance carriers. Income earned on insurance products was $8,919 and $8,590 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Contingency income is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience on our clients' policies during the previous year. Increases and decreases in contingency income are reflective of corresponding increases and decreases in the amount of claims paid by insurance carriers. Contingency income, which is included in the Other noninterest income\u201d line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income, was $828 and $832 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur Wealth Management segment has two primary divisions: Trust and Financial Services. The Trust division operates on a custodial basis which includes administration of benefit plans, as well as accounting and money management for trust accounts. The division manages a number of trust accounts inclusive of personal and corporate benefit accounts, self-directed IRAs, and custodial accounts. Fees for managing these accounts are based on changes in market values of the assets under management in the account, with the amount of the fee depending on the type of account. The Financial Services division provides specialized products and services to our customers, which include fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds, and stocks offered through a third party provider. Wealth Management revenue was $14,433 for 2019 compared to $13,540 for 2018. The market value of assets under management or administration was $3,888,253 and $3,307,879 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nMortgage banking income is derived from the origination and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans that the Company has sold but retained the right to service. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled $2,381,178 in 2019 and $1,763,246 in 2018. The increase in mortgage loan originations is due to the current interest rate environment as well as an increase in producers throughout our footprint in 2019. In addition to organic growth in the number of producers, in the second quarter of 2019 we acquired the wholesale mortgage operations of another financial institution, including all of its producers. Mortgage banking income, specifically mortgage servicing income, was negatively impacted during 2019 by a mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustment of $1,836, as actual prepayment speeds of the mortgages the Company serviced exceeded the Company's estimates of prepayment speeds.\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage banking income included in noninterest income at December 31: Table 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sales of loans, net\n</td> <td>45,854\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees, net\n</td> <td>11,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage banking income, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,896\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBMG contributed $3,683 to mortgage banking income during 2018 prior to its divestiture.\nNoninterest income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 includes the Company's net gains on sale of securities of $348, as the Company sold securities with a carrying value $212,137 at the time of sale for net proceeds of $212,485. Losses on sales of securities for the twelve months ended 2018 were $16, resulting from the sale of approximately $2,403 in securities. For more information on securities sold during the two year period ended December 31, 2019, see Note 3, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nBank-owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d) income is derived from changes in the cash surrender value of the bank-owned life insurance policies and can fluctuate upon the collection of death benefit proceeds. BOLI income increased to $6,109 in 2019 as compared to $4,644 for the same period in 2018. In connection with the acquisition of Brand, the Company acquired BOLI with a cash surrender value of $40,081.\nOther noninterest income includes contingency income from our insurance underwriters, income from our SBA banking division, and other miscellaneous income and can fluctuate based on the claims experience in our Insurance agency, production in our SBA banking division, and recognition of other unseasonal income items. Other noninterest income was $10,147 for 2019 compared to $8,533 for 2018.\nNoninterest Expense\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest Expense to Average Assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.91%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.11%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNoninterest expense was $374,174 and $345,029 for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. As mentioned previously, the Company incurred expenses in connection with certain transactions with respect to which management is unable to accurately predict when these expenses will be incurred or, when incurred, the amount of such expenses. The following table presents these expenses for the periods presented:\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and Conversion expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt prepayment penalty\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAside from the expenses presented above, the increase in noninterest expense from 2018 to 2019 was primarily driven by the additional expenses associated with the acquisition of Brand's operations, as discussed in more detail in the remainder of this section. Included in noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 is $4,398 attributable to BMG.\nSalaries and employee benefits is the largest component of noninterest expense and represented 67.02% and 62.11% of total noninterest expense at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During 2019, salaries and employee benefits increased $36,490, or 17.03%, to $250,784 as compared to $214,294 for 2018. The increase in salaries and employee benefits is primarily attributable to new employees added in the Brand acquisition, production hires made by the Company during 2019 throughout our footprint and the impact of the wholesale mortgage operations acquired in the second quarter of 2019.\nThe compensation expense recorded in connection with awards of restricted stock, which is included within salaries and employee benefits, was $9,456 and $6,633 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. A portion of restricted stock awards in both years was subject to the satisfaction of performance-based conditions.\nData processing costs increased $1,052 to $19,679 in 2019 from $18,627 in 2018. Increased costs resulting from the acquired operations of Brand have been slightly offset by cost savings realized through contract renegotiations.\nNet occupancy and equipment expense in 2019 was $49,553, an increase of $7,442, compared to $42,111 for 2018. Aside from the increase attributable to the additional locations and assets from Brand, the increase in net occupancy and equipment expense is also attributable to investments in our IT infrastructure in response to banking and governmental regulation and increased global risk from cyber security breaches.\nExpenses related to other real estate owned for 2019 were $2,013, compared to $1,892 in 2018. Expenses on other real estate owned for 2019 include write downs of $1,265 of the carrying value to fair value on certain pieces of property held in other real estate owned compared to write downs of $1,545 in 2018. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of $6,498 was sold during 2019, resulting in a net loss of $94, compared to other real estate owned with a cost basis of $7,127 sold during 2018 for a net gain of $423.\nProfessional fees include fees for legal and accounting services. Professional fees were $10,166 for 2019 as compared to $8,753 for 2018. Professional fees remain elevated in large part due to additional legal, accounting and consulting fees associated with compliance costs of newly enacted as well as existing banking and governmental regulation.\nAdvertising and public relations expense was $11,607 for 2019, an increase of $2,143 compared to $9,464 for 2018. This year-over-year increase is attributable to advertising and marketing costs associated with the Company's increased focus on digital marketing and branding throughout our footprint as well as an increase in the marketing of the Company's community involvement.\nAmortization of intangible assets totaled $8,105 for 2019 compared to $7,179 for 2018. This amortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets which are being amortized over the useful lives as determined at acquisition. These finite-lived intangible assets have remaining estimated useful lives ranging from approximately 1 year to approximately 10 years.\nCommunication expenses are those expenses incurred for communication to clients and between employees. Communication expenses were $8,858 for 2019 as compared to $8,318 for 2018. The increased costs over the last two years is due to the overall increase is size and growth of the Company.\nEfficiency Ratio\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Efficiency Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Efficiency ratio (GAAP)\n</td> <td>62.03%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.15%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on efficiency ratio from:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net gains on sales of securities\n</td> <td>0.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible amortization\n</td> <td>(1.34)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.32)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merger and conversion related expenses\n</td> <td>(0.05)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.61)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>(0.01)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustment\n</td> <td>(0.19)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted efficiency ratio (1)\n</td> <td>60.48%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.22%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Adjusted efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of this financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP as well as an explanation of why the Company provides non-GAAP financial measures can be found under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d heading at the end of this Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this report.\nThe efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. The Company calculates this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and noninterest income. The table above shows the impact on the efficiency ratio of expenses that (1) the Company does not consider to be part of our normal operations, such as amortization of intangibles, or (2) the Company incurred in connection with certain transactions where management is unable to accurately predict when these expenses will be incurred or, when incurred, the amount of such expenses, such as merger and conversion related expenses and debt prepayment penalties. We remain committed to aggressively managing our costs within the framework of our business model. We expect the efficiency ratio to continue to improve from levels currently reported as a result of revenue growth while at the same time controlling noninterest expenses.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for 2019 and 2018 was $48,091 and $41,727, respectively. The effective tax rates for those years were 22.30% and 22.12%, respectively. For additional information regarding the Company's income taxes, please refer to in Note 16, Income Taxes,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nRisk Management\nThe management of risk is an on-going process. Primary risks that are associated with the Company include credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Credit and interest rate risk are discussed below, while liquidity risk is discussed in the next subsection under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nCredit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\nInherent in any lending activity is credit risk, that is, the risk of loss should a borrower default. The Company's credit quality remained strong in 2019, and the Company continues to see the lowest levels of charge-offs and nonperforming loans since the 2008-2009 recession. These results are due in part to current economic conditions both nationally and in the Company's markets, declining unemployment levels, improved labor participation rate, improved performance of the housing market, and the Company's continued efforts to bring problem credits to resolution.\nManagement of Credit Risk. Credit risk is monitored and managed on an ongoing basis by a credit administration department, a problem asset resolution committee and the Board of Directors Loan Committee. Credit quality, adherence to policies and loss mitigation are major concerns of credit administration and these committees. The Company's central appraisal review department\nreviews and approves third-party appraisals obtained by the Company on real estate collateral and monitors loan maturities to ensure updated appraisals are obtained. This department is managed by a State Certified General Real Estate Appraiser and employs four additional State Certified General Real Estate Appraisers and four real estate evaluators.\nWe have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function. Adherence to these policies and procedures is monitored by management and the Board of Directors. A number of committees and an underwriting staff oversee the lending operations of the Company. These include in-house problem asset resolution committees and the Board of Directors Loan Committee. In addition, we maintain a loan review staff to independently monitor loan quality and lending practices. Loan review personnel monitor and, if necessary, adjust the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination, focusing their review on commercial and real estate loans rather than consumer and small balance consumer mortgage loans, such as 1-4 family mortgage loans.\nIn compliance with loan policy, the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience. In addition, each lending officer's prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits. Before funds are advanced on consumer and C&I loans below certain dollar thresholds, loans are reviewed and scored using centralized underwriting methodologies. Loan quality, or risk-rating,\u201d grades are assigned based upon certain factors, which include the scoring of the loans. This information is used to assist management in monitoring credit quality. Loan requests of amounts greater than an officer's lending limits are reviewed by senior credit officers or the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors.\nFor commercial and commercial real estate secured loans, risk-rating grades are assigned by lending, credit administration and loan review personnel, based on an analysis of the financial and collateral strength and other credit attributes underlying each loan. Loan grades range from 1 to 9, with 1 being loans with the least credit risk. Allowance factors established by management are applied to the total balance of loans in each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance factors are established based on historical loss ratios experienced by the Company for these loan types, as well as the credit quality criteria underlying each grade, adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios. In making these adjustments to the allowance factors, management takes into consideration factors which it believes are causing, or are likely in the future to cause, losses within our loan portfolio but that may not be fully reflected in our historical loss ratios. For portfolio balances of consumer, small balance consumer mortgage loans, such as 1-4 family mortgage loans, and certain other similar loan types, allowance factors are determined based on historical loss ratios by portfolio for the preceding eight quarters and may be adjusted by other qualitative criteria.\nManagement's problem asset resolution committee and the Board of Directors' Loan Committee monitor loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded and placed on the Company's internal watch list due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor; the committees then adjust loan grades accordingly. This information is used to assist management in monitoring credit quality.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for problem loans of $500 or greater by, as applicable, the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For real estate collateral, the fair market value of the collateral is based upon a recent appraisal by a qualified and licensed appraiser of the underlying collateral. When the ultimate collectability of a loan's principal is in doubt, wholly or partially, the loan is placed on nonaccrual.\nAfter all collection efforts have failed, collateral securing loans may be repossessed and sold or, for loans secured by real estate, foreclosure proceedings initiated. The collateral is sold at public auction for fair market value (based upon recent appraisals described in the above paragraph), with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price. The purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance. If the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds, the deficient balance is sent to the Board of Directors' Loan Committee for charge-off approval. These charge-offs reduce the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously through the provision for loan losses.\nThe Company's practice is to charge off estimated losses as soon as such loss is identified and reasonably quantified. Net charge-offs for 2019 were $3,914, or 0.04% as a percentage of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of $3,995, or 0.05% as a percentage of average loans, for 2018. The charge-offs in 2019 were fully reserved for in the Company's allowance for loan losses and resulted in no additional provision for loan loss expense.\nAllowance for Loan Losses; Provision for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established after input from management, loan review and the problem asset resolution committee. Factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, which occurs on a quarterly basis, include the internal risk rating of individual credits, loan segmentation, historical and current trends in net charge-offs, trends in nonperforming loans, trends in past due loans, trends in the market values of underlying collateral securing loans and the unemployment rate and other current economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. In addition, on a regular basis, management and the Board of Directors review loan ratios. These ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans. Also, management reviews past due ratios by officer, community bank and the Company as a whole. Additional information about our accounting policies applicable to the allowance for loan losses can be found in the \"Critical Accounting Policies\" section above under the headings \"Allowance for Loan Losses\" and \"Business Combinations, Accounting for Purchased Loans.\"\nThe allowance for loan losses was $52,162 and $49,026 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Company continually monitors these loans as part of our normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated future cash flows. The period end amount of our allowance for loan losses allocated to loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 totaled $1,971 and $2,552 during 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of management, is necessary to\nmaintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to meet the inherent risks of losses in our loan\nportfolio. The provision for loan losses was $7,050 and $6,810 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company continues to experience low levels of classified loans and nonperforming loans, as illustrated in the nonperforming loan tables later in this section, which has allowed a relatively flat provision over the last three years.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for Loan Losses to Average Loans\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0.08%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table below reflects the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended December 31:\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>7,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial, agricultural\n</td> <td>2,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>943\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease financing\n</td> <td>278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate -

Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned. Nonperforming loans are loans on which the accrual of interest has stopped and loans that are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually 90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. Management, the problem asset resolution committee and our loan review staff closely monitor loans that are considered to be nonperforming.\nOther real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

The Company's coverage ratio, or its allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans, was 143.61% as of December 31, 2019 as compared to 188.77% as of December 31, 2018. The coverage ratio for non purchased, nonperforming loans was 208.92% as of December 31, 2019 as compared to 379.96% as of December 31, 2018.\nManagement has evaluated the aforementioned loans and other loans classified as nonperforming and believes that all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2019. Management also continually monitors past due loans for potential credit quality deterioration. Total loans 30-89 days past due on which interest was still accruing were $37,668 at December 31, 2019 as compared to $36,597 at December 31, 2018.\nAlthough not classified as nonperforming loans, another category of assets that contribute to our credit risk is restructured loans. Restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower's financial condition and are performing in accordance with the new terms. Such concessions may include reduction in interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments. In evaluating whether to restructure a loan, management analyzes the long-term financial condition of the borrower, including guarantor and collateral support, to determine whether the proposed concessions will increase the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest. Restructured loans that are not performing in accordance with their restructured terms that are either contractually 90 days past due or placed on nonaccrual status are reported as nonperforming loans.\nAs shown below, restructured loans totaled $11,954 at December 31, 2019 compared to $12,820 at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, loans restructured through interest rate concessions represented 26% of total restructured loans, while loans restructured by a concession in payment terms represented the remainder.

The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit-taking activities. Management believes a significant impact on the Company's financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis.\nBecause of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our profitability, the Board of Directors and management actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure. We have an Asset/Liability Committee (the ALCO\u201d) that is authorized by the Board of Directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to make decisions relating to that process. The ALCO's goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital. The ALCO uses an asset/liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model is used to perform both net interest income forecast simulations for multiple year horizons, and economic value of equity ( EVE\u201d) analyses, each under various interest rate scenarios, which could impact the results presented in the table below.\nNet interest income simulations measure the short and medium-term earnings exposure from changes in market interest rates in a rigorous and explicit fashion. Our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under various hypothetical rate scenarios. EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time for a given set of market rate assumptions. An increase in EVE due to a specified rate change indicates an improvement in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet.\nThe following table presents the projected impact of a change in interest rates on (1) static EVE and (2) earnings at risk (that is, net interest income) for the 1-12 and 13-24 month periods commencing January 1, 2020, in each case as compared to the result under rates present in the market on December 31, 2019. The changes in interest rates assume an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Change In:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Immediate Change in Rates of:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Economic Value Equity (EVE)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Earning at Risk (EAR) (Net Interest Income)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Static\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-12 Months\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13-24 Months\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.64%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.63%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.05%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.01%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.63%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.45%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.12%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.72%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.75%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.97%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.31)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.86)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.28)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe rate shock results for the EVE and net interest income simulations for the next 24 months produce an asset sensitive position at December 31, 2019 and are all within the parameters set by the Board of Directors.\nThe preceding measures assume no change in the size or asset/liability compositions of the balance sheet, and they do not reflect future actions the ALCO may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates.\nThe scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of plus 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points and minus 100 basis points. As interest rates are adjusted over a period of time, it is our strategy to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions including asset prepayment speeds, the impact of competitive factors on our pricing of loans and deposits, how responsive our deposit repricing is to the change in market rates and the expected life of non-maturity deposits. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. Such assumptions may not necessarily reflect the manner or timing in which cash flows, asset yields and liability costs respond to changes in market rates. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results will differ from simulated results.\nThe Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate contracts such as swaps, caps and/or floors, forward commitments, and interest rate lock commitments, as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure. For more information about the Company's derivative financial instruments, see the Off-Balance Sheet Transactions\u201d section below and Note 15, Derivative Instruments,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs.\nCore deposits, which are deposits excluding time deposits and public fund deposits, are a major source of funds used by the Bank to meet cash flow needs. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to assuring the Bank's liquidity. Our Asset/Liability Management Committee has established targets for our liquidity ratio, which helps determine the Bank's ability to meet cash and funding obligations under current financial and economic conditions, as well as the ratio of our non-core funding to our total funding. Management continually monitors these ratios and also stresses our sources of liquidity under various scenarios to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity.\nOur investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Within the next twelve months the securities portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow through principal payments and maturities equal to 24.47% of the carrying value of the total securities portfolio. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At December 31, 2019, securities with a carrying value of $444,603 were pledged to secure government, public, trust, and other deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings and derivative instruments as compared to $637,607 at December 31, 2018.\nOther sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds purchased and short-term and long-term advances from the FHLB. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances. Federal funds are short term borrowings, generally overnight borrowings, between financial institutions that are used to maintain reserve requirements at the Federal Reserve Bank. There were no federal funds purchased outstanding at December 31, 2019 or 2018. The balance of\nshort-term borrowing from the FHLB (i.e., advances with original maturities less than one year) at December 31, 2019 was $480,000, as compared to $380,000 at December 31, 2018. Long-term FHLB borrowings are used to match-fund against large, fixed rate commercial or real estate loans with long-term maturities, which negates interest rate exposure when rates rise. This was our primary use of long-term FHLB borrowings in 2018 and the first three quarters of 2019; in the fourth quarter of 2019, as interest rates declined following the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, we used long-term FHLB borrowings as a source of liquidity in lieu of higher-costing deposits, which had not repriced as quickly following the rate cuts. At December 31, 2019, the balance of our outstanding long-term advances with the FHLB was $152,337 as compared to $6,690 at December 31, 2018. The total amount of the remaining credit available to us from the FHLB at December 31, 2019 was $3,159,942. We also maintain lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $150,000. These are unsecured, uncommitted lines of credit maturing at various times within the next twelve months. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIn 2016 we accessed the capital markets to generate liquidity through the sale of our subordinated notes. Additionally, as part of previous acquisitions in 2017 and 2018, the Company assumed other subordinated notes. For more information concerning the offering of our subordinated notes and the details of the assumed subordinated notes please see Note 13, Long-Term Debt\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nOur strategy in choosing funds is focused on minimizing cost along with considering our balance sheet composition and interest rate risk position. Accordingly, management targets growth of non-interest bearing deposits. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer. We constantly monitor our funds position and evaluate the effect that various funding sources have on our financial position. The following table presents, by type, the Company's funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, and the total cost of each funding source for each of the years presented:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost of Funds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>23.26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>44.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings\n</td> <td>6.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Time deposits\n</td> <td>21.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term borrowings\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term Federal Home Loan Bank advances\n</td> <td>0.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subordinated notes\n</td> <td>1.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term borrowings\n</td> <td>1.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits and borrowed funds\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.93\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and cash equivalents were $414,930 at December 31, 2019, compared to $569,111 at December 31, 2018. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $505,910 compared to $503,287 in 2018. Proceeds from the sale, maturity or call of securities within our investment portfolio were $474,772 for 2019 compared to $163,090 for 2018. These proceeds from the investment portfolio were primarily reinvested back into the securities portfolio or used to fund loan growth. Purchases of investment securities were $492,018 for 2019 compared to $686,887 for 2018.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $188,106 compared to $708,833 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Overall deposits, excluding deposits acquired during each year, increased $85,925 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an increase of $496,404 for the same period in 2018.\nRestrictions on Bank Dividends, Loans and Advances\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources, as well as its ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, are substantially dependent on the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. Under Mississippi law, a Mississippi bank may not pay dividends unless its earned surplus is in excess of three times capital stock. A Mississippi bank with earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock may pay a dividend, subject to the approval of the DBCF. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to prohibit the Bank from engaging in business practices that the FDIC considers to be unsafe or unsound, which, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, could include the payment of dividends. Accordingly, the approval of the DBCF is required prior to the Bank paying dividends to the Company, and under certain circumstances the approval of the FDIC may be required.\nFederal Reserve regulations also limit the amount the Bank may loan to the Company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations. At December 31, 2019, the maximum amount available for transfer from the Bank to the Company in the form of loans was $138,862. The Company maintains a line of credit collateralized by cash with the Bank totaling $3,061. There were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at December 31, 2019. These restrictions did not have any impact on the Company's ability to meet its cash obligations in 2019, nor does management expect such restrictions to materially impact the Company's ability to meet its currently-anticipated cash obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Transactions\nThe Company enters into loan commitments, standby letters of credit and derivative financial instruments in the normal course of its business. Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of the Company's customers. Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company's normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management's credit assessment of the customer.\nLoan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company in that while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The Company's unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows:\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,324,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,068,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td>94,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company closely monitors the amount of remaining future commitments to borrowers in light of prevailing economic conditions and adjusts these commitments as necessary. The Company will continue this process as new commitments are entered into or existing commitments are renewed.\nThe Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate contracts such as swaps, caps and/or floors, as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure and to facilitate the needs of its customers. The Company enters into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract position with other financial institutions. The Company manages its credit risk, or potential risk of default by its commercial customers, through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures. At December 31, 2019, the Company had notional amounts of $219,664 on interest rate contracts with corporate customers and $219,664 in offsetting interest rate contracts with other financial institutions to mitigate the Company's rate exposure on its corporate customers' contracts.\nAdditionally, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with its customers to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the commitments to fund fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and also enters into forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors.\nThe Company also enters into forward interest rate swap contracts on its FHLB borrowings and its junior subordinated debentures that are all accounted for as cash flow hedges. Under each of these contracts, the Company pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus a predetermined spread.\nFor more information about the Company's off-balance sheet transactions, see Note 15, Derivative Instruments\u201d and Note 21, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2019, significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date.

Book value per share was $37.39 and $34.91 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The growth in shareholders' equity was attributable to earnings retention and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income offset by dividends declared and common stock repurchased through the stock repurchase program.\nThe Company maintains a shelf registration statement with the SEC. The shelf registration statement, which was effective upon filing, allows the Company to raise capital from time to time through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units, or a combination thereof, subject to market conditions. Specific terms and prices will be determined at the time of any offering under a separate prospectus supplement that the Company will be required to file with the SEC at the time of the specific offering. The proceeds of the sale of securities, if and when offered, will be used for general corporate purposes as described in any prospectus supplement and could include the expansion of the Company's banking, insurance and wealth management operations as well as other business opportunities.\nThe Company completed its previously announced $50,000 stock repurchase program in October 2019. The weighted average price of all shares of common stock repurchased over the entire repurchase program was $34.45.\nIn October 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program, authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $50,000 of its outstanding common stock, either in open market purchases or privately-negotiated transactions. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased $20.0 million of common stock at a weighted average price of $35.23 under the new program. The program will remain in effect until the earlier of October 2020 or the repurchase of the entire amount of common stock authorized to be repurchased by the Board of Directors.\nThe Company has junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $110,215 at December 31, 2019, of which $106,624 are included in the Company's Tier 1 capital. Federal Reserve guidelines limit the amount of securities that, similar to our junior subordinated debentures, are includable in Tier 1 capital, but these guidelines did not impact the amount of debentures we include in Tier 1 capital. Although our existing junior subordinated debentures are currently unaffected by these Federal Reserve guidelines, on account of changes enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, any new trust preferred securities are not includable in Tier 1 capital. Further, if as a result of an acquisition we exceed $15,000,000 in assets, or if we make any acquisition after we have exceeded $15,000,000 in assets, we will lose Tier 1 treatment of our junior subordinated debentures.\nThe Company has subordinated notes with a carrying value of $113,955 at December 31, 2019, of which $113,617 are included in the Company's Tier 2 capital.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that bank holding companies and banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the following classifications:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

applicable to the Company and the Bank, please refer to the information under the heading Capital Adequacy Guidelines\u201d in the Supervision and Regulation-Supervision and Regulation of Renasant Corporation\u201d sections and the Supervision and Regulation-Supervision and Regulation of Renasant Bank\u201d section in Item 1, Business, in this report.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), this document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures, namely, return on average tangible shareholders' equity, return on average tangible assets, the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets and an adjusted efficiency ratio. These non-GAAP financial measures adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude intangible assets and certain charges (such as, when applicable, merger and conversion expenses, debt prepayment penalties and asset valuation adjustments) with respect to which the Company is unable to accurately predict when these charges will be incurred or, when incurred, the amount thereof. Management uses these measures to evaluate capital utilization and adequacy. In addition, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate the making of period-to-period comparisons and are meaningful indicators of its operating performance, particularly because these measures are widely used by industry analysts for companies with merger and acquisition activities. Also, because intangible assets such as goodwill and the core deposit intangible and charges such as merger and conversion expenses can vary extensively from company to company and, as to intangible assets, are excluded from the calculation of a financial institution's regulatory capital, the Company believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial information allows readers to more easily compare the Company's results to information provided in other regulatory reports and the results of other companies. The reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP for these financial measures are below.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which provides a discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPerformance Overview\nNet income was $167,596 for 2019 compared to $146,920 for 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) were $2.89 and $2.88, respectively, for 2019 compared to $2.80 and $2.79, respectively, for 2018. At December 31, 2019, total assets increased to $13,400,618 from $12,934,878 at December 31, 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and results of operations from 2018 to 2019 has been influenced by a number of factors:\n Acquisitions - Effective September 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc. ( Brand\u201d) in a transaction valued at $474,453. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2,334,333 which included gross loans with a fair value of $1,580,339, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,859,880, including deposits with a fair value of $1,714,177. The acquisition expanded the Company's footprint in the greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Financial Highlights - Net interest income increased 11.89% to $443,657 for 2019 as compared to $396,525 for 2018. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to the increase in average earnings assets from the acquisition of Brand and organic growth in the Company's non purchased loan portfolio. Yields on earning assets increased as we replaced maturing assets with assets earning similar or higher rates of interest. Furthermore, the Company capitalized on the rising rate environment over the last two years, ending in July 2019, by replacing maturing loans with new or renewed loans at similar or higher rates. These efforts helped offset the negative impact to our net interest income and net interest margin from not only rising costs of our deposits and borrowings as competition increased in response to the aforementioned rate environment but also the impact of loan yields as rates decreased in the latter half of 2019. - Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.04% in 2019 compared to 0.05% in 2018. The provision for loan losses was $7,050 for 2019 compared to $6,810 for 2018. - Noninterest income was $153,254 for 2019 compared to $143,961 for 2018. The growth in noninterest income is primarily attributable to the Brand acquisition and growth in our mortgage banking operations. Effective July 1, 2019, we became subject to the limitations on interchange fees imposed pursuant to \u00a71075 of the Dodd-Frank Act (this provision, commonly referred to as the Durbin Amendment,\u201d is discussed in more detail under the heading Supervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business, in this report). The Durbin Amendment limitations reduced interchange fees by approximately $6,000 during the second half of 2019. - Noninterest expense was $374,174 and $345,029 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in noninterest expense and its related components is primarily attributable to the Brand acquisition as well as increases in salaries and employee benefits as the Company engaged in above-average hiring of new production team members over the course of 2019 to support its long term growth strategy. The Company recorded merger expense related to its recent acquisitions of $279 and $14,246 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Merger expense did not impact diluted EPS in 2019, but decreased it by $0.21 in 2018. - Loans, net of unearned income, were $9,689,638 at December 31, 2019 compared to $9,083,129 at December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of 6.68% from the previous year. Excluding purchased loans of $2,101,664 and $2,693,417 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the portfolio increased by $1,198,262, or 18.75%, from December 31, 2018. - Deposits totaled $10,213,168 at December 31, 2019 compared to $10,128,557 at December 31, 2018. Noninterest bearing deposits averaged $2,463,436, or 24.19% of average deposits, for 2019 compared to $2,036,754, or 22.83% of average deposits, for 2018. \nA historical look at key performance indicators is presented below. \n (1) These performance indicators are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP as well as an explanation of why the Company provides these non-GAAP financial measures can be found under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d heading at the end of this Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts. Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions and considers other factors that could impact these estimates. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards, are discussed in further detail in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report. The following discussion details the accounting policies governing some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies\u201d ( ASC 450\u201d), in our loan portfolio. Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310, Receivables\u201d ( ASC 310\u201d). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under ASC 310 and the related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For more information about the considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations, Accounting for Purchased Loans\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. For a purchased loan, no allowance for loan losses is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk. This applies even to a purchased loan with evidence of credit deterioration since origination pursuant to ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d). Generally speaking, rather than carry over an allowance for loan losses, as part of the acquisition we establish a Day 1 Fair Value\u201d of a purchased loan or pools of purchased loans sharing common risk characteristics, which equals the outstanding balance of a purchased loan or pool on the acquisition date less any credit and/or yield discount applied against the purchased loan or pool of loans. In other words, these loans or pools of loans are carried at values which represent our estimate of their future cash flows. After the acquisition date, a purchased loan or pool of loans will either meet or exceed the performance expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values or deteriorate from such expected performance. If the cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased loan or pool of loans decreases from expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values or since our most recent review of such portfolio's performance, then the decrease is recognized as an impairment, and the Company provides for such loan or pool in the provision for loan losses in its consolidated statement of income; ultimately,\nthe Company may partially or fully charge-off the carrying value thereof. If performance expectations are exceeded such that we increase our expectations of cash flows to be collected on the loan or pool, then the Company reverses any previous provision for such loan or pool and, if it continues to exceed expectations subsequent to the reversal of any previously-established provision, then we adjust the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the loan's or pool's remaining life, which has a positive impact on interest income.\nAdditional detail about our loans acquired in connection with our mergers, including our acquisition of Brand, is set forth below under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and in Note 5, Purchased Loans\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc.\nOn September 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition by merger of Brand Group Holdings, Inc. ( Brand\u201d), the parent company of The Brand Banking Company. At closing, Brand merged with and into the Company, with the Company the surviving corporation in the merger; immediately thereafter, The Brand Banking Company merged with and into Renasant Bank, with Renasant Bank being the surviving banking corporation in the merger. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as presented in the table below, have been recorded at fair value.\n\nAs part of the merger agreement, Brand agreed to divest the operations of its subsidiary Brand Mortgage Group, LLC ( BMG\u201d), which transaction was completed as of October 31, 2018. As a result, the balance sheet and results of operations of BMG, which the Company considers to be immaterial to the overall results of the Company, are included in the Company's results from September 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the results of operations for BMG included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n\nThe Company's financial condition and results of operations include the impact of Brand's operations since the September 1, 2018 acquisition date.\nSee Note 2, Mergers and Acquisitions,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report, for details regarding the Company's recent mergers and acquisitions.\nAssets\nTotal assets were $13,400,618 at December 31, 2019 compared to $12,934,878 at December 31, 2018. The acquisition of Brand increased total assets $2,334,333 at September 1, 2018.\nInvestments\nThe securities portfolio is used to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs and to supply securities to be used in collateralizing certain deposits and other types of borrowings. The following table shows the carrying value of our securities portfolio by investment type and the percentage of such investment type relative to the entire securities portfolio, at December 31:\n\nDuring 2019, we purchased $492,018 in investment securities. Mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), in the aggregate, comprised approximately 79% of the purchases. CMOs are included in the Mortgage backed securities\u201d line item in the above table. The mortgage backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are issued by government sponsored entities. Obligations of state and political subdivisions comprised approximately 17% of purchases made during 2019. Other debt securities in our investment portfolio consist of corporate debt securities and issuances from the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). The carrying value of securities sold during 2019 totaled $212,137, resulting in a net gain of $348, while proceeds from maturities and calls of securities during 2019 totaled $262,287, which were primarily reinvested in the securities portfolio.\nThe Company successfully implemented several strategic initiatives, collectively referred to as our deleveraging strategy,\u201d to manage its consolidated assets below $10,000,000 at December 31, 2017 in order to delay the impact of the Durbin Amendment. The deleveraging strategy involved the sale of certain investment securities and the shortening of the holding period of mortgage loans held for sale; the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce certain wholesale funding sources. During 2018, we purchased $686,887 in investment securities; the majority of these purchases were made as part of the releveraging of the Company's balance sheet, which was completed in the second quarter of 2018, with the remainder of our purchases being ordinary course purchases of investment securities. Mortgage backed securities and CMOs, in the aggregate, comprised approximately 97% of the purchases. The carrying value of securities sold during 2018 totaled $2,403 resulting in a net loss of $16. Proceeds from maturities and calls of securities during 2018 totaled $160,703, which were primarily reinvested in the securities portfolio. The Brand acquisition in 2018 contributed $71,122 at the acquisition date to the securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2019, unrealized losses of $4,878 were recorded on available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of $364,723. At December 31, 2018, unrealized losses of $18,269 were recorded on available for sale securities with a carrying value of $822,506. The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective securities as scheduled. Accordingly, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFor more information about the Company's trust preferred securities, see Note 3, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale were $318,272 at December 31, 2019 compared to $411,427 at December 31, 2018. Included in the balance at December 31, 2018 is a portfolio of non-mortgage consumer loans of approximately $191,578 acquired from Brand. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company reclassified this portfolio from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. At the time of transfer, the portfolio totaled approximately $134,335. Aside from these loans, loans held for sale primarily consists of residential mortgage loans being held until they are sold on the secondary market.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored entities, and the Company is obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within 30-40 days after the loan is funded. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market.\nLoans\nLoans, excluding loans held for sale, are the Company's most significant earning asset, comprising 72.31% and 70.22% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The table below sets forth the balance of loans outstanding by loan type at December 31:\n\nThe Brand acquisition on September 1, 2018 increased the loan portfolio by $1,322,207 on the acquisition date.\nThe following table presents the percentage of loans, by category, to total loans at December 31 for the last five years:\n\nLoan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At December 31, 2019, there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans other than loans disclosed in the table above.\nIn 2018 and 2019, the Company experienced organic loan growth across all categories of loans. Loans from our specialty commercial business lines, which consist of our asset-based lending, Small Business Administration lending, healthcare, factoring, and equipment lease financing banking groups, contributed $173,295 of the total increase in loans from December 31, 2018.\nLooking at the change in loans geographically, loans in our Western Region (which includes Mississippi), Eastern Region (which includes Georgia and east Florida) and Central Region (which includes Alabama and the Florida panhandle) markets increased\n$114,978, $379,214 and $142,999, respectively, when compared to December 31, 2018, while loans in our Northern Region (which includes Tennessee) decreased by $30,682.\nThe following tables provide a breakdown of non purchased loans and purchased loans from previous acquisitions as of the dates presented:\n\n\n \nLoans secured by real estate represented 81.92%, 83.53%, 84.05%, 85.93% and 85.47% of the Company's total loan portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following table provides further details of the types of loans in the Company's loan portfolio secured by real estate at December 31:\n\nDeposits\n\nThe Company relies on deposits as its major source of funds. Total deposits were $10,213,168 and $10,128,557 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $2,551,770 and $2,318,706 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were $7,661,398 and $7,809,851 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in noninterest-bearing deposits in 2019 was attributable to organic growth throughout our footprint, as discussed below, and highlights the emphasis the Company has placed on growing core deposits (that is, deposits other than time and public fund deposits). The acquisition of", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In Thousands, Except Share Data)\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which provides a discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPerformance Overview\nNet income was $167,596 for 2019 compared to $146,920 for 2018. Basic and diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) were $2.89 and $2.88, respectively, for 2019 compared to $2.80 and $2.79, respectively, for 2018. At December 31, 2019, total assets increased to $13,400,618 from $12,934,878 at December 31, 2018. The comparability of our financial condition and results of operations from 2018 to 2019 has been influenced by a number of factors:\n Acquisitions - Effective September 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc. ( Brand\u201d) in a transaction valued at $474,453. Including the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, the Company acquired assets with a fair value of $2,334,333 which included gross loans with a fair value of $1,580,339, and assumed liabilities with a fair value of $1,859,880, including deposits with a fair value of $1,714,177. The acquisition expanded the Company's footprint in the greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. Financial Highlights - Net interest income increased 11.89% to $443,657 for 2019 as compared to $396,525 for 2018. The increase from 2018 to 2019 was due primarily to the increase in average earnings assets from the acquisition of Brand and organic growth in the Company's non purchased loan portfolio. Yields on earning assets increased as we replaced maturing assets with assets earning similar or higher rates of interest. Furthermore, the Company capitalized on the rising rate environment over the last two years, ending in July 2019, by replacing maturing loans with new or renewed loans at similar or higher rates. These efforts helped offset the negative impact to our net interest income and net interest margin from not only rising costs of our deposits and borrowings as competition increased in response to the aforementioned rate environment but also the impact of loan yields as rates decreased in the latter half of 2019. - Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to 0.04% in 2019 compared to 0.05% in 2018. The provision for loan losses was $7,050 for 2019 compared to $6,810 for 2018. - Noninterest income was $153,254 for 2019 compared to $143,961 for 2018. The growth in noninterest income is primarily attributable to the Brand acquisition and growth in our mortgage banking operations. Effective July 1, 2019, we became subject to the limitations on interchange fees imposed pursuant to \u00a71075 of the Dodd-Frank Act (this provision, commonly referred to as the Durbin Amendment,\u201d is discussed in more detail under the heading Supervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business, in this report). The Durbin Amendment limitations reduced interchange fees by approximately $6,000 during the second half of 2019. - Noninterest expense was $374,174 and $345,029 for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in noninterest expense and its related components is primarily attributable to the Brand acquisition as well as increases in salaries and employee benefits as the Company engaged in above-average hiring of new production team members over the course of 2019 to support its long term growth strategy. The Company recorded merger expense related to its recent acquisitions of $279 and $14,246 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Merger expense did not impact diluted EPS in 2019, but decreased it by $0.21 in 2018. - Loans, net of unearned income, were $9,689,638 at December 31, 2019 compared to $9,083,129 at December 31, 2018, which represents an increase of 6.68% from the previous year. Excluding purchased loans of $2,101,664 and $2,693,417 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, the portfolio increased by $1,198,262, or 18.75%, from December 31, 2018. - Deposits totaled $10,213,168 at December 31, 2019 compared to $10,128,557 at December 31, 2018. Noninterest bearing deposits averaged $2,463,436, or 24.19% of average deposits, for 2019 compared to $2,036,754, or 22.83% of average deposits, for 2018. \nA historical look at key performance indicators is presented below.

A reconciliation of these financial measures from GAAP to non-GAAP as well as an explanation of why the Company provides these non-GAAP financial measures can be found under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d heading at the end of this Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts. Wherever feasible, we utilize third-party information to provide management with estimates. Although independent third parties are engaged to assist us in the estimation process, management evaluates the results, challenges assumptions and considers other factors that could impact these estimates. We monitor the status of proposed and newly issued accounting standards to evaluate the impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our accounting policies, including the impact of newly issued accounting standards, are discussed in further detail in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report. The following discussion details the accounting policies governing some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC\u201d) 450, Contingencies\u201d ( ASC 450\u201d), in our loan portfolio. Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310, Receivables\u201d ( ASC 310\u201d). The balance of the loans determined to be impaired under ASC 310 and the related allowance is included in management's estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors, primarily historical loss ratios and assigned risk ratings, and external factors, primarily the economic environment. While no one factor is dominant, each could cause actual loan losses to differ materially from originally estimated amounts. For more information about the considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses and our loan policies and procedures for addressing credit risk, please refer to the disclosures in this Item under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses.\u201d\nBusiness Combinations, Accounting for Purchased Loans\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations,\u201d which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and recognized separately from goodwill. For a purchased loan, no allowance for loan losses is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value measurements incorporate assumptions regarding credit risk. This applies even to a purchased loan with evidence of credit deterioration since origination pursuant to ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality\u201d ( ASC 310-30\u201d). Generally speaking, rather than carry over an allowance for loan losses, as part of the acquisition we establish a Day 1 Fair Value\u201d of a purchased loan or pools of purchased loans sharing common risk characteristics, which equals the outstanding balance of a purchased loan or pool on the acquisition date less any credit and/or yield discount applied against the purchased loan or pool of loans. In other words, these loans or pools of loans are carried at values which represent our estimate of their future cash flows. After the acquisition date, a purchased loan or pool of loans will either meet or exceed the performance expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values or deteriorate from such expected performance. If the cash flows expected to be collected on a purchased loan or pool of loans decreases from expectations established in determining the Day 1 Fair Values or since our most recent review of such portfolio's performance, then the decrease is recognized as an impairment, and the Company provides for such loan or pool in the provision for loan losses in its consolidated statement of income; ultimately,\nthe Company may partially or fully charge-off the carrying value thereof. If performance expectations are exceeded such that we increase our expectations of cash flows to be collected on the loan or pool, then the Company reverses any previous provision for such loan or pool and, if it continues to exceed expectations subsequent to the reversal of any previously-established provision, then we adjust the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the loan's or pool's remaining life, which has a positive impact on interest income.\nAdditional detail about our loans acquired in connection with our mergers, including our acquisition of Brand, is set forth below under the heading Risk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d and in Note 5, Purchased Loans\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nFinancial Condition\nThe following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018.\nMergers and Acquisitions\nAcquisition of Brand Group Holdings, Inc.\nOn September 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition by merger of Brand Group Holdings, Inc.

Mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d), in the aggregate, comprised approximately 79% of the purchases. CMOs are included in the Mortgage backed securities\u201d line item in the above table. The mortgage backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are issued by government sponsored entities. Obligations of state and political subdivisions comprised approximately 17% of purchases made during 2019. Other debt securities in our investment portfolio consist of corporate debt securities and issuances from the Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). The carrying value of securities sold during 2019 totaled $212,137, resulting in a net gain of $348, while proceeds from maturities and calls of securities during 2019 totaled $262,287, which were primarily reinvested in the securities portfolio.\nThe Company successfully implemented several strategic initiatives, collectively referred to as our deleveraging strategy,\u201d to manage its consolidated assets below $10,000,000 at December 31, 2017 in order to delay the impact of the Durbin Amendment. The deleveraging strategy involved the sale of certain investment securities and the shortening of the holding period of mortgage loans held for sale; the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce certain wholesale funding sources. During 2018, we purchased $686,887 in investment securities; the majority of these purchases were made as part of the releveraging of the Company's balance sheet, which was completed in the second quarter of 2018, with the remainder of our purchases being ordinary course purchases of investment securities. Mortgage backed securities and CMOs, in the aggregate, comprised approximately 97% of the purchases. The carrying value of securities sold during 2018 totaled $2,403 resulting in a net loss of $16. Proceeds from maturities and calls of securities during 2018 totaled $160,703, which were primarily reinvested in the securities portfolio. The Brand acquisition in 2018 contributed $71,122 at the acquisition date to the securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2019, unrealized losses of $4,878 were recorded on available for sale investment securities with a carrying value of $364,723. At December 31, 2018, unrealized losses of $18,269 were recorded on available for sale securities with a carrying value of $822,506. The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective securities as scheduled. Accordingly, the Company did not record any other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nFor more information about the Company's trust preferred securities, see Note 3, Securities,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale were $318,272 at December 31, 2019 compared to $411,427 at December 31, 2018. Included in the balance at December 31, 2018 is a portfolio of non-mortgage consumer loans of approximately $191,578 acquired from Brand. In the third quarter of 2019, the Company reclassified this portfolio from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. At the time of transfer, the portfolio totaled approximately $134,335. Aside from these loans, loans held for sale primarily consists of residential mortgage loans being held until they are sold on the secondary market.\nMortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a best efforts\u201d basis or under a mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreement. Under a best efforts\u201d sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored entities, and the Company is obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery\u201d sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met. These loans are typically sold within 30-40 days after the loan is funded. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market.\nLoans\nLoans, excluding loans held for sale, are the Company's most significant earning asset, comprising 72.31% and 70.22% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
