The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, CEG.\nThe Company's environmentally-sound asset portfolio includes over 5,875 MW of wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation facilities, as well as district energy systems. Through this diversified and contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. Nearly all of these assets sell substantially all of their output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 13 years as of December 31, 2019 based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,530 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 139 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nSignificant Events\nPacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Certain subsidiaries of the Company, which hold interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW, sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing, and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $177 million in restricted cash, $1.4 billion of property, plant and equipment, net, $370 million in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and $1.2 billion of borrowings with final maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2038 related to these facilities. The related subsidiaries of the Company are parties to financing agreements consisting of non-recourse project-level debt and, in certain cases, non-recourse holding company debt. The PG&E Bankruptcy triggered defaults under the PPAs with PG&E and such related project-level financing agreements. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion of principal, net of the related unamortized debt issuance costs, as short-term debt as of December 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> On September 9, 2019, PG&E filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, or the PG&E Plan, which would provide for PG&E to assume all of its PPAs with the Company. On October 17, 2019, an ad hoc group of senior noteholders filed a competing plan of reorganization, which would also provide for PG&E to assume all of its PPAs with the Company.\nOn January 22, 2020, PG&E announced it had reached an agreement with a group of senior noteholders, and on January 31, 2020, the PG&E Plan was amended to provide for the eventual implementation of such settlement. On February 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved such settlement, and the noteholders have accordingly agreed to support the PG&E Plan. On February 5, 2020, the noteholders caused the ad hoc noteholder plan to be withdrawn. There are many conditions that must be satisfied before the PG&E Plan and assumption of the PPAs can become effective, including but not limited to approvals by various classes of creditors, the Bankruptcy Court, and the CPUC. A hearing before the Bankruptcy Court to consider whether the PG&E Plan will be approved and confirmed is currently expected to occur on May 27, 2020.\nAs of March 2, 2020, the Company's contracts with PG&E have operated in the normal course and the Company currently expects these contracts to continue as such. As of March 2, 2020, the Company has entered into forbearance agreements for certain project-level financing arrangements and continues to seek forbearance agreements for its other project-level financing arrangements affected by the PG&E Bankruptcy. The Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E Bankruptcy as events occur.\nJanuary 2020 Drop Down Offer\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On January 8, 2020, CEG offered the Company the opportunity to acquire and invest in a portfolio of the following projects: (i) 100% of the equity interests in Rattlesnake Flat, LLC, which owns the Rattlesnake Wind Project, a 144 net MW wind facility located in Adams County, WA; (ii) CEG's interest in Repowering Partnership II LLC (Repowering 1.0), would give the Company a 100% equity interest in Repowering 1.0; and (iii) a new partnership with CEG to repower the Pinnacle Wind Project, a 55 net MW wind facility located in Mineral County, WV.

Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company\ncannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter. To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance for such periods.\nCapital Market Conditions\nThe capital markets in general are often subject to volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The Company's growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional renewable facilities from CEG and additional conventional and renewable facilities from unaffiliated third parties, which will require access to debt and equity financing to complete such acquisitions or replenish capital for future acquisitions. Any broad market fluctuations may affect the Company's ability to access such capital through debt or equity financings.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table provides selected

and 2018\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Economic Gross Margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic Gross Margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic Gross Margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that Economic Gross Margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic Gross Margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic Gross Margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to

The remaining increase in depreciation expense is due to several projects in the Renewables segment reaching COD throughout 2018 and 2019, as well as increased acquisition activity in the Thermal and Conventional segments in 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nImpairment Losses\nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $19 million relates to a project within Thermal segment and was recorded in connection with the Company entering into a purchase and sale agreement with DB Energy Assets, LLC on September 9, 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions. The Company also recorded an impairment loss of $14 million related to several wind projects from the Renewables segment, as further described in Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to increase in headcount, primarily in the Corporate and Thermal segments, resulting from the separation from NRG due to the GIP Transaction.\nTransaction and Integration Costs\nTransaction and integration related costs of $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflect costs incurred by the Company under the TSA with NRG, as further described in Item 15 - Note 1,Nature of Business, as well as fees paid in connection with the acquisitions that took place in 2019. Transaction and integration costs of $20 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflect fees paid to advisors and other costs associated with the GIP Transaction, as well as fees paid in connection with the acquisitions that took place in 2018.\nDevelopment Costs\nDevelopment costs increased by $2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher business development activity within the Thermal segment.\nEquity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to higher income allocated to RPV Holdco in 2019 compared to 2018, partially offset by higher losses at Desert Sunlight, DGPV Holdco entities, as well as GenConn and Avenal.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nThe Company recorded loss on debt extinguishment of $16 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, $15 million of which relates to the redemption of the 2024 Senior Notes. On December 13, 2019, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $412 million, or 82.4% of the 2024 Senior Notes, which was effectuated at a premium of 103% for a total consideration of $424 million and as a result, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment in the amount of $12 million.

These factors and others, including the Company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nNet (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had a loss of $14 million attributable to CEG's economic interest in Clearway Energy LLC, as well as $21 million of net losses attributable to CEG's interests in the Repowering, Oahu, and Kawailoa partnerships. The Company also recorded a net loss of $57 million attributable to noncontrolling interests with respect to tax equity financing arrangements and the application of the HLBV method, primarily reflecting tax benefits allocated to tax equity investors in periods immediately subsequent to COD. This was partially offset by $7 million of income attributable to a third party's interest in Kawailoa partnership.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $2 million was comprised of income of $106 million, of which $104 million was attributable to NRG for the period prior to the GIP Transaction and $2 million was attributable to CEG for the period after the GIP Transaction, and losses of $104 million attributable to tax equity investors. These losses were attributable to the application of HLBV, which generally allocates losses to the investors for the first several years after fund formation, including $55 million for the Buckthorn Solar project which generated tax credits allocated primarily to the tax equity investor when it reached COD in July 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company's principal liquidity requirements are to meet its financial commitments, finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from time to time, service debt and pay dividends. As a normal part of the Company's business, depending on market conditions, the Company will from time to time consider opportunities to repay, redeem, repurchase or refinance its indebtedness. Changes in the Company's operating plans, lower than anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause the Company to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods. There can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Debt financing, if available, could impose additional cash payment obligations and additional covenants and operating restrictions.\nCurrent Liquidity Position\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company's liquidity was approximately $842 million and $1,037 million, respectively, comprised of cash, restricted cash and availability under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clearway Energy, Inc. and Clearway Energy LLC, excluding subsidiaries\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subsidiaries\n</td> <td>125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restricted cash:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating accounts\n</td> <td>129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reserves, including debt service, distributions, performance obligations and other reserves\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>583\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving credit facility availability\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>842\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's liquidity includes $262 million and $176 million of restricted cash balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds to satisfy the requirements of certain debt arrangements and funds held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use. As of December 31, 2019, these restricted funds comprised of $129 million designated to fund operating expenses, approximately $24 million designated for current debt service payments, and $30 million restricted for reserves including debt service, performance obligations and other reserves, as well as capital expenditures. The remaining $79 million is held in distribution reserve accounts, of which $58 million related to subsidiaries affected by the PG&E Bankruptcy, as discussed further below and may not be distributed during the pendency of the bankruptcy. Such subsidiaries had a total of $177 million in restricted cash as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility and $70 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The Company had $170 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and a total of $69 million in letters of credit outstanding as of February 24, 2020.\nOn January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The PG&E Bankruptcy had no effect on availability under the Company's revolving credit facility. However, the Company has non-recourse project-level debt related to each of its subsidiaries that sell their output to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The PG&E Bankruptcy filing is an event of default under the related financing agreements which caused uncertainty around the timing of when certain project-level cash distributions will be available to the Company. As of December 31, 2019, all project level cash balances for these subsidiaries were classified as restricted cash.\nOn December 20, 2019, each of Clearway Energy Operating LLC, as borrower, and Clearway Energy LLC, as guarantor, entered into the Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to provide for an increase of 0.50x to the Borrower Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, for the last two fiscal quarters of 2020 and to implement certain other technical modifications.\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position, cash flows from operations and availability under its revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the Company's financial commitments; debt service obligations; growth, operating and maintenance capital expenditures; and to fund dividends to holders of the Company's Class A common stock and Class C common stock. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\nCredit Ratings\nCredit rating agencies rate a firm's public debt securities. These ratings are utilized by the debt markets in evaluating a firm's credit risk. Ratings influence the price paid to issue new debt securities by indicating to the market the Company's ability to pay principal, interest and preferred dividends. Rating agencies evaluate a firm's industry, cash flow, leverage, liquidity and hedge profile, among other factors, in their credit analysis of a firm's credit risk.\nThe following table summarizes the credit ratings for the Company and its Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019. The ratings outlook is stable.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>S&P\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clearway Energy, Inc.\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.75% Senior Notes, due 2025\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.000% Senior Notes, due 2026\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.750% Senior Notes, due 2028\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Liquidity\nThe Company's principal sources of liquidity include cash on hand, cash generated from operations, proceeds from sales of assets, borrowings under new and existing financing arrangements and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities as appropriate given market conditions. As described in Item 15 - Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and above in Significant Events During the Year Ended December 31, 2019, the Company's financing arrangements consist of the equity offering of Class C common stock on September 27, 2018, corporate level debt, which includes Senior Notes, Convertible Notes and the revolving credit facility; the ATM Program; and project-level financings for its various assets.\n2028 Senior Notes - On December 11, 2019, Clearway Energy Operating LLC completed the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount due 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes. The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at 4.75% and mature on March 15, 2028.

forward balance of $1 billion for financial statement purposes, of which $0.9 billion will begin expiring between 2033 to 2037 if unutilized. The Company does not anticipate any federal income tax payments for 2020. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, the Company has a cumulative state NOL carryforward balance of $649 million for financial statement purposes, which will expire between 2023 to 2039 if unutilized. The Company does not anticipate significant income tax payments for state and local jurisdictions in 2020. Based on the Company's current and expected NOL balances generated primarily by accelerated tax depreciation of its property, plant and equipment, the Company does not expect to pay significant federal income tax for a period of approximately ten years inclusive of any NOL generated after 2017 or later subject to an 80% limitation against future taxable income pursuant to the Tax Act.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has an interest disallowance carry forward of $219 million as a result of the proposed \u00a7163(j) regulation, which was enacted as part of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The disallowed interest deduction has an indefinite carry forward period and any limitations on the utilization of this carry forward have been factored into our valuation allowance analysis. These are proposed regulations which are not final and are subject to change in the regulatory review process.\nThe Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Company is not subject to U.S. federal or state income tax examinations for years prior to 2013.\nThe Company has no uncertain tax benefits.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nObligations under Certain Guarantee Contracts\nThe Company may enter into guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties.\nRetained or Contingent Interests\nThe Company does not have any material retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity.\nObligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity\nVariable interest in equity investments - As of December 31, 2019, the Company has several investments with an ownership interest percentage of 50% or less in energy and energy-related entities that are accounted for under the equity method. DGPV Holdco 1 LLC, DGPV Holdco 2 LLC, DGPV Holdco 3 LLC, RPV Holdco 1 LLC and GenConn are variable interest entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately $889 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates as it related to the projects affected by PG&E bankruptcy was $411 million. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to the Company. See also Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe Company has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company's capital expenditure programs. The following table summarizes the Company's contractual obligations.

In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements.\nThe tables below disclose the activities of non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at December 31, 2019, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at December 31, 2019.

As discussed below in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk -Commodity Price Risk, the Company measures the sensitivity of the portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. The Company's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the net open position.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known.\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are summarized in Item 15 - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company's critical accounting policies include income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accounting Policy\n</td> <td>Judgments/Uncertainties Affecting Application\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n</td> <td>Ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Anticipated future decisions of tax authorities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Ability to utilize tax benefits through carry backs to prior periods and carry forwards to future periods\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Long Lived Assets\n</td> <td>Recoverability of investments through future operations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Regulatory and political environments and requirements\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated useful lives of assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Operational limitations and environmental obligations\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of future cash flows\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimates of fair value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Judgment about triggering events\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had a valuation allowance of $15 million. The valuation allowance is related to a deferred tax asset expected to result in a capital loss for which no existing capital gains or tax planning strategies to utilize the asset in the future are available, as well as state net operating losses the Company expects to expire unutilized. Other than for this expected capital loss and state NOL mentioned above, the Company believes it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income which includes the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences to realize deferred tax assets. The Company considered the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act upon timing and future realization of net deferred tax assets, the profit before tax generated in recent years, as well as projections of future earnings and estimates of taxable income in arriving at this conclusion. The realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon earnings in federal and various state and local jurisdictions.\nConsiderable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws. The project-level entities, as former subsidiaries of NRG, are no longer subject to federal audit examination for years prior to 2015 but are subject to state and local audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income tax examinations for all years beginning in 2013.\nEvaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, or ASC 360, property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events are:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adverse business climate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Current-period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term energy prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. The fair value may be determined by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available to the Company as appropriate. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows or comparable values determined by transactions in the market. The Company uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel costs and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates, and the impact of such variations could be material.\nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of energy prices, including the Company's fundamental view for long-term power prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget.\nThe Company recorded certain long-lived asset impairments in 2019, as described below and in Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, with respect to several wind projects.\nThe Company recorded an impairment loss of $19 million related to a facility in the Thermal segment during the second quarter of 2019. The impairment was triggered by a potential sale negotiation with a third party which resulted in signing the purchase and sale agreement in September, as further described in Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions. The fair value of the facility was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant. The income approach utilized estimates of discounted future cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurement and include key inputs, such as forecasted power prices, operations and maintenance expense, and discount rates. The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the assets.\nAdditionally, during the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of the preparation and review of its annual budget and assessment of long-term merchant prices, the Company updated its estimated future cash flows and determined that the future cash flows for several wind projects from the Renewables segment no longer supported the recoverability of the related long-lived asset. As such, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $14 million to reflect the assets at fair market value. There were no other triggering events identified prior to the fourth quarter annual budget update for these asset groups. The fair value of the facilities was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for each respective plant. The income approach included key inputs such as forecasted merchant power prices, operations and maintenance expense, and discount rates. The resulting fair value is a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nThe Company is also required to evaluate its equity method investments to determine whether or not they are impaired. ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures, or ASC 323, provides the accounting requirements for these investments. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether the value is considered to be an other-than-temporary decline in value. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that the Company makes with respect to its equity method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, the Company would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323.\nCertain of the Company's projects have useful lives that extend well beyond the contract period and therefore, management's view of long-term energy prices in the post-contract periods may have a significant impact on the expected future cash flows for these projects. Accordingly, if management lowers its view of long-term energy prices in certain markets, it is possible that some of the Company's other long-lived assets may be impaired.\nAs previously described, on January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Certain subsidiaries of the Company sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs, including interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. The Company has determined that it has no impairment of the long-lived assets or equity method investments associated with these subsidiaries. Assumptions utilized to test these assets for impairment may change based on future events related to the PG&E Bankruptcy, which could result in an impairment loss if the PPAs are rejected or amended, or if the Company is not able to collect its revenues from PG&E in a timely manner.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nSee Item 15 - Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments.", "summary": "The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) report provides an overview of Clearway Energy, Inc.'s financial condition and operational performance.

Also refer to Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors, which include detailed discussions of various items impacting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Discussions of the year ended December 31, 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and year-to-year comparisons of the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:\n \u2022 Executive Summary, including a description of the business and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition; \n \u2022 Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 Financial condition addressing liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements; \n \u2022 Known trends that may affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the future; and \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. \nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction and Overview\nClearway Energy, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a publicly-traded energy infrastructure investor in and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, CEG.\nThe Company's environmentally-sound asset portfolio includes over 5,875 MW of wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation facilities, as well as district energy systems. Through this diversified and contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. Nearly all of these assets sell substantially all of their output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 13 years as of December 31, 2019 based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,530 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 139 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nSignificant Events\nPacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy\n \u2022 On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Certain subsidiaries of the Company, which hold interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW, sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing, and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $177 million in restricted cash, $1.4 billion of property, plant and equipment, net, $370 million in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and $1.2 billion of borrowings with final maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2038 related to these facilities. The related subsidiaries of the Company are parties to financing agreements consisting of non-recourse project-level debt and, in certain cases, non-recourse holding company debt. The PG&E Bankruptcy triggered defaults under the PPAs with PG&E and such related project-level financing agreements. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion of principal, net of the related unamortized debt issuance costs, as short-term debt as of December 31, 2019.  On September 9, 2019, PG&E filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, or the PG&E Plan, which would provide for PG&E to assume all of its PPAs with the Company. On October 17, 2019, an ad hoc group of senior noteholders filed a competing plan of reorganization, which would also provide for PG&E to assume all of its PPAs with the Company.\nOn January 22, 2020, PG&E announced it had reached an agreement with a group of senior noteholders, and on January 31, 2020, the PG&E Plan was amended to provide for the eventual implementation of such settlement. On February 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved such settlement, and the noteholders have accordingly agreed to support the PG&E Plan. On February 5, 2020, the noteholders caused the ad hoc noteholder plan to be withdrawn. There are many conditions that must be satisfied before the PG&E Plan and assumption of the PPAs can become effective, including but not limited to approvals by various classes of creditors, the Bankruptcy Court, and the CPUC. A hearing before the Bankruptcy Court to consider whether the PG&E Plan will be approved and confirmed is currently expected to occur on May 27, 2020.\nAs of March 2, 2020, the Company's contracts with PG&E have operated in the normal course and the Company currently expects these contracts to continue as such. As of March 2, 2020, the Company has entered into forbearance agreements for certain project-level financing arrangements and continues to seek forbearance agreements for its other project-level financing arrangements affected by the PG&E Bankruptcy. The Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E Bankruptcy as events occur.\nJanuary 2020 Drop Down Offer\n \u2022 On January 8, 2020, CEG offered the Company the opportunity to acquire and invest in a portfolio of the following projects: (i) 100% of the equity interests in Rattlesnake Flat, LLC, which owns the Rattlesnake Wind Project, a 144 net MW wind facility located in Adams County, WA; (ii) CEG's interest in Repowering Partnership II LLC (Repowering 1.0), would give the Company a 100% equity interest in Repowering 1.0; and (iii) a new partnership with CEG to repower the Pinnacle Wind Project, a 55 net MW wind facility located in Mineral County, WV. The Company expects to sign \nbinding agreements for the drop down offer in the first half of 2020 though these agreements remain subject to negotiation and approval by the Company's Independent Directors.\nCEG ROFO Agreement Amendment\n \u2022 On August 1, 2019, the CEG ROFO Agreement was amended to grant the Company a right of first offer for four additional projects: Rattlesnake, a 144 net MW wind facility located in Adams County, WA with an expected COD in 2020\u037e Repowering 2.0, which will consist of membership interests in one or more partnerships formed to repower certain wind assets owned by the Company using turbines provided by CEG; Black Rock, a 110 MW utility scale wind facility located in West Virginia with an expected COD in 2021; and Wildflower, a 100 MW utility scale solar facility located in Mississippi with an expected COD in 2022. Both Rattlesnake and the Pinnacle repowering were part of January 2020 Drop Down Offer described above.  Carlsbad Drop Down\n \u2022 On December 6, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of GIP's membership interests in CBAD Holdings, LLC, which indirectly owns Carlsbad Energy Center LLC, a 527 megawatt natural gas fired power project located in Carlsbad, California, or the Carlsbad Drop Down Asset. The purchase price for the Carlsbad Drop Down was $184 million in cash, plus assumption of $803 million in project level financing including non-recourse senior secured notes described below. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from the Clearway Energy, Inc. equity issuance, as described further below, as well as borrowings from the Company's revolving credit facility. The Carlsbad acquisition is the result of the Company having elected its option to purchase Carlsbad pursuant to the ROFO agreement, as amended, by and among the Company, CEG and GIP. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.  Sale of HSD Solar Holdings, LLC Assets\n \u2022 On October 8, 2019, the Company, through HSD Solar Holdings, LLC, or HSD, sold 100% of its interests in certain distributed generation solar facilities totaling 6 MW to the offtaker under the PPA, for cash consideration of $20 million, as a result of the offtaker exercising its right to purchase the project pursuant to the PPA. In conjunction with the sale, the Company repaid in full the non-recourse lease financing associated with the HSD projects. The repaid amount was net of cash released at closing and totaled $23 million.  Repowering Transaction\n \u2022 On June 14, 2019, the Company, through an indirect subsidiary, entered into binding equity commitment agreements in the previously announced partnership with CEG to enable the repowering of two of its existing wind assets, Wildorado and Elbow Creek, which total a combined 283 MW. The Company invested $102 million in net corporate capital to fund the repowering of the wind facilities during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. These repowered assets have reached COD. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities.  Hawaii Solar Partnerships\n \u2022 Kawailoa Solar Partnership - On May 1, 2019, the Company entered into a partnership with Clearway Renew LLC, a subsidiary of CEG, to own, finance, operate, and maintain the Kawailoa Solar Partnership, which consists of the Kawailoa Solar project, a 49 MW utility-scale solar generation project located in Oahu, Hawaii. The Company contributed $9 million into the partnership during the year ended December 31, 2019. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 5 , Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities. \n \u2022 Oahu Solar Partnership - On March 8, 2019, the Company entered into a partnership with Clearway Renew LLC, a subsidiary of CEG, to own, finance, operate, and maintain the Oahu Solar projects, which consist of Lanikuhana and Waipio, 15 MW and 46 MW utility-scale solar generation projects, respectively, located in Oahu, Hawaii, which both reached COD in September 2019 and began to sell power to HECO pursuant to the long-term PPAs. The Company contributed $20 million into the partnership during the year ended December 31, 2019. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities. \nCorporate-Level Financing and Equity Activities\n \u2022 On December 20, 2019, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to provide for an increase of 0.50x to the borrower leverage ratio, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, for the last two fiscal quarters of 2020 and to implement certain other technical modifications. \n \u2022 On December 11, 2019, Clearway Energy Operating LLC completed the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes. The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at 4.75% and mature on March 15, 2028. Interest on the 2028 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, and interest payments will commence on September 15, 2020. The 2028 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Clearway Energy Operating LLC and are guaranteed by Clearway Energy LLC and by certain of Clearway Energy Operating LLC's wholly owned current and future subsidiaries. The proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to partially fund investments into Repowering 1.0, repay the 2024 Senior Notes as described below, and pay transaction fees and expenses. \n \u2022 On December 13, 2019, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $412 million or 82.4%, of the 2024 Senior Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as part of the previously announced cash tender offer. Concurrently with the launch of the tender offer, the Company exercised its right to optionally redeem any 2024 Senior Notes not validly tendered and purchased in the tender offer, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes. This redemption of the remaining $88 million of outstanding 2024 Senior Notes occurred on January 3, 2020. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 10, Long-term Debt. \n \u2022 On December 2, 2019, the Company issued and sold 5,405,405 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of $100 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 5,405,405 Class C units of Clearway Energy LLC, which used the proceeds to partially fund the acquisition of the Carlsbad Drop Down Asset to pay transaction fees and for general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 In January 2019, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $50 million of the 2019 Convertible Notes in open market transactions. The repurchases were funded through a partial repayment of the intercompany note between Clearway Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc. The 2019 Convertible Notes matured on February 1, 2019 and the Company paid off the remaining balance of an aggregate principal amount of $170 million.  Project-Level Financing Activities\n \u2022 On November 4, 2019, Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of GIP and the owner of the Carlsbad Energy Center LLC, issued $216 million of senior secured, non-recourse notes.

As part of the acquisition, Duquesne University entered into a 40-year Energy Services Agreement through which ECP Uptown Campus LLC will fulfill the university's electricity, chilled water and steam requirements in exchange for monthly capacity payments.  Black Start Services at Marsh Landing\n \u2022 On December 1, 2017, the California Independent System Operator selected a proposal by the Company's Marsh Landing project to provide black start capability in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. The black start service would restart Marsh Landing in the event of a blackout to support the California Independent System Operator's directed restoration of the electrical grid in response to an emergency condition. The Company has advanced the project and will provide additional details dependent on FERC approval rulings. \nCVSR Outage\n \u2022 On June 5, 2019, a fire occurred at the California Valley Solar Ranch project, which affected approximately 1,200 acres of property. While the fire did not impact solar arrays, damage occurred to associated infrastructure including distribution poles and cabling. The facility was restored to full operations on July 1, 2019. The full year impact of the fire was approximately $8 million of lost revenue. \nEnvironmental Matters and Regulatory Matters\nDetails of environmental matters and regulatory matters are presented in Item 1 - Business, Regulatory Matters and Item 1A - Risk Factors. Details of some of this information relate to costs that may impact the Company's financial results.\nTrends or Matters Affecting Results of Operations and Future Business Performance\nPG&E Bankruptcy\nAs discussed above, the Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E Bankruptcy filing as events occur. However, no impact to the Company's immediate operating activities has occurred as of December 31, 2019.\nWind and Solar Resource Availability\nThe availability of the wind and solar resources affects the financial performance of the wind and solar facilities, which may impact the Company's overall financial performance. Due to the variable nature of the wind and solar resources, the Company\ncannot predict the availability of the wind and solar resources and the potential variances from expected performance levels from quarter to quarter. To the extent the wind and solar resources are not available at expected levels, it could have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance for such periods.\nCapital Market Conditions\nThe capital markets in general are often subject to volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The Company's growth strategy depends on its ability to identify and acquire additional renewable facilities from CEG and additional conventional and renewable facilities from unaffiliated third parties, which will require access to debt and equity financing to complete such acquisitions or replenish capital for future acquisitions. Any broad market fluctuations may affect the Company's ability to access such capital through debt or equity financings.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table provides selected financial information:\n\n\n \n(a) Volumes do not include the MWh generated/sold by the Company's equity method investments.\n(b) Volumes generated are not sold as the Conventional facilities sell capacity rather than energy.\n(c) MWh sold do not include 108 MWh generated by Dover, a subsidiary of the Company, under the PPA with NRG Power Marketing during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nManagement's discussion of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nGross Margin\nThe Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Economic Gross Margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic Gross Margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic Gross Margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that Economic Gross Margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic Gross Margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic Gross Margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nGross margin decreased by $21 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to:\n\nOperations and Maintenance Expense\nOperations and maintenance expense increased by $7 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, primarily driven by higher insurance claims, which lowered expense in 2018, as well higher operations and maintenance costs in the Renewables segment in connection with fire damages at CVSR.\nOther Costs of Operations\nOther costs of operations increased by $3 million primarily due to higher insurance costs across the segments, as well as ARO accretion due to certain Renewables projects, which reached COD in 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $65 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to accelerated depreciation at the Wildorado Wind and Elbow Creek projects in connection with the repowering activities, which resulted in an additional $54 million of depreciation expense. The remaining increase in depreciation expense is due to several projects in the Renewables segment reaching COD throughout 2018 and 2019, as well as increased acquisition activity in the Thermal and Conventional segments in 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nImpairment Losses\nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $19 million relates to a project within Thermal segment and was recorded in connection with the Company entering into a purchase and sale agreement with DB Energy Assets, LLC on September 9, 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions. The Company also recorded an impairment loss of $14 million related to several wind projects from the Renewables segment, as further described in Item 15 - Note 9, Asset Impairments.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 due to increase in headcount, primarily in the Corporate and Thermal segments, resulting from the separation from NRG due to the GIP Transaction.\nTransaction and Integration Costs\nTransaction and integration related costs of $3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflect costs incurred by the Company under the TSA with NRG, as further described in Item 15 - Note 1,Nature of Business, as well as fees paid in connection with the acquisitions that took place in 2019. Transaction and integration costs of $20 million during the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\nAs you read this discussion and analysis, refer to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations to this Form 10-K. Also refer to Item 1 - Business and Item 1A - Risk Factors, which include detailed discussions of various items impacting the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Discussions of the year ended December 31, 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and year-to-year comparisons of the year ended December 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe discussion and analysis below has been organized as follows:\n \u2022 Executive Summary, including a description of the business and significant events that are important to understanding the results of operations and financial condition; \n \u2022 Results of operations, including an explanation of significant differences between the periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of operations; \n \u2022 Financial condition addressing liquidity position, sources and uses of cash, capital resources and requirements, commitments, and off-balance sheet arrangements; \n \u2022 Known trends that may affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition in the future; and \n \u2022 Critical accounting policies which are most important to both the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgment. \nExecutive Summary\nIntroduction and Overview\nClearway Energy, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, or the Company, is a publicly-traded energy infrastructure investor in and owner of modern, sustainable and long-term contracted assets across North America. The Company is sponsored by GIP through GIP's portfolio company, CEG.\nThe Company's environmentally-sound asset portfolio includes over 5,875 MW of wind, solar and natural gas-fired power generation facilities, as well as district energy systems. Through this diversified and contracted portfolio, the Company endeavors to provide its investors with stable and growing dividend income. Nearly all of these assets sell substantially all of their output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 13 years as of December 31, 2019 based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,530 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 139 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.\nSignificant Events\nPacific Gas and Electric Company Bankruptcy\n \u2022 On January 29, 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Certain subsidiaries of the Company, which hold interests in 6 solar facilities totaling 480 MW and Marsh Landing with capacity of 720 MW, sell the output of their facilities to PG&E under long-term PPAs. The Company consolidates three of the solar facilities and Marsh Landing, and records its interest in the other solar facilities as equity method investments. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $177 million in restricted cash, $1.4 billion of property, plant and equipment, net, $370 million in investments in unconsolidated affiliates and $1.2 billion of borrowings with final maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2038 related to these facilities. The related subsidiaries of the Company are parties to financing agreements consisting of non-recourse project-level debt and, in certain cases, non-recourse holding company debt. The PG&E Bankruptcy triggered defaults under the PPAs with PG&E and such related project-level financing agreements. As a result, the Company recorded $1.2 billion of principal, net of the related unamortized debt issuance costs, as short-term debt as of December 31, 2019.  On September 9, 2019, PG&E filed a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, or the PG&E Plan, which would provide for PG&E to assume all of its PPAs with the Company. On October 17, 2019, an ad hoc group of senior noteholders filed a competing plan of reorganization, which would also provide for PG&E to assume all of its PPAs with the Company.\nOn January 22, 2020, PG&E announced it had reached an agreement with a group of senior noteholders, and on January 31, 2020, the PG&E Plan was amended to provide for the eventual implementation of such settlement. On February 4, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved such settlement, and the noteholders have accordingly agreed to support the PG&E Plan. On February 5, 2020, the noteholders caused the ad hoc noteholder plan to be withdrawn. There are many conditions that must be satisfied before the PG&E Plan and assumption of the PPAs can become effective, including but not limited to approvals by various classes of creditors, the Bankruptcy Court, and the CPUC. A hearing before the Bankruptcy Court to consider whether the PG&E Plan will be approved and confirmed is currently expected to occur on May 27, 2020.\nAs of March 2, 2020, the Company's contracts with PG&E have operated in the normal course and the Company currently expects these contracts to continue as such. As of March 2, 2020, the Company has entered into forbearance agreements for certain project-level financing arrangements and continues to seek forbearance agreements for its other project-level financing arrangements affected by the PG&E Bankruptcy. The Company continues to assess the potential future impacts of the PG&E Bankruptcy as events occur.\nJanuary 2020 Drop Down Offer\n \u2022 On January 8, 2020, CEG offered the Company the opportunity to acquire and invest in a portfolio of the following projects: (i) 100% of the equity interests in Rattlesnake Flat, LLC, which owns the Rattlesnake Wind Project, a 144 net MW wind facility located in Adams County, WA; (ii) CEG's interest in Repowering Partnership II LLC (Repowering 1.0), would give the Company a 100% equity interest in Repowering 1.0; and (iii) a new partnership with CEG to repower the Pinnacle Wind Project, a 55 net MW wind facility located in Mineral County, WV. The Company expects to sign \nbinding agreements for the drop down offer in the first half of 2020 though these agreements remain subject to negotiation and approval by the Company's Independent Directors.\nCEG ROFO Agreement Amendment\n \u2022 On August 1, 2019, the CEG ROFO Agreement was amended to grant the Company a right of first offer for four additional projects: Rattlesnake, a 144 net MW wind facility located in Adams County, WA with an expected COD in 2020\u037e Repowering 2.0, which will consist of membership interests in one or more partnerships formed to repower certain wind assets owned by the Company using turbines provided by CEG; Black Rock, a 110 MW utility scale wind facility located in West Virginia with an expected COD in 2021; and Wildflower, a 100 MW utility scale solar facility located in Mississippi with an expected COD in 2022. Both Rattlesnake and the Pinnacle repowering were part of January 2020 Drop Down Offer described above.  Carlsbad Drop Down\n \u2022 On December 6, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of GIP's membership interests in CBAD Holdings, LLC, which indirectly owns Carlsbad Energy Center LLC, a 527 megawatt natural gas fired power project located in Carlsbad, California, or the Carlsbad Drop Down Asset. The purchase price for the Carlsbad Drop Down was $184 million in cash, plus assumption of $803 million in project level financing including non-recourse senior secured notes described below. The acquisition was funded with proceeds from the Clearway Energy, Inc. equity issuance, as described further below, as well as borrowings from the Company's revolving credit facility. The Carlsbad acquisition is the result of the Company having elected its option to purchase Carlsbad pursuant to the ROFO agreement, as amended, by and among the Company, CEG and GIP. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.  Sale of HSD Solar Holdings, LLC Assets\n \u2022 On October 8, 2019, the Company, through HSD Solar Holdings, LLC, or HSD, sold 100% of its interests in certain distributed generation solar facilities totaling 6 MW to the offtaker under the PPA, for cash consideration of $20 million, as a result of the offtaker exercising its right to purchase the project pursuant to the PPA. In conjunction with the sale, the Company repaid in full the non-recourse lease financing associated with the HSD projects. The repaid amount was net of cash released at closing and totaled $23 million.  Repowering Transaction\n \u2022 On June 14, 2019, the Company, through an indirect subsidiary, entered into binding equity commitment agreements in the previously announced partnership with CEG to enable the repowering of two of its existing wind assets, Wildorado and Elbow Creek, which total a combined 283 MW. The Company invested $102 million in net corporate capital to fund the repowering of the wind facilities during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. These repowered assets have reached COD. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities.  Hawaii Solar Partnerships\n \u2022 Kawailoa Solar Partnership - On May 1, 2019, the Company entered into a partnership with Clearway Renew LLC, a subsidiary of CEG, to own, finance, operate, and maintain the Kawailoa Solar Partnership, which consists of the Kawailoa Solar project, a 49 MW utility-scale solar generation project located in Oahu, Hawaii. The Company contributed $9 million into the partnership during the year ended December 31, 2019. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 5 , Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities. \n \u2022 Oahu Solar Partnership - On March 8, 2019, the Company entered into a partnership with Clearway Renew LLC, a subsidiary of CEG, to own, finance, operate, and maintain the Oahu Solar projects, which consist of Lanikuhana and Waipio, 15 MW and 46 MW utility-scale solar generation projects, respectively, located in Oahu, Hawaii, which both reached COD in September 2019 and began to sell power to HECO pursuant to the long-term PPAs. The Company contributed $20 million into the partnership during the year ended December 31, 2019. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 5, Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method and Variable Interest Entities. \nCorporate-Level Financing and Equity Activities\n \u2022 On December 20, 2019, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to provide for an increase of 0.50x to the borrower leverage ratio, as defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, for the last two fiscal quarters of 2020 and to implement certain other technical modifications. \n \u2022 On December 11, 2019, Clearway Energy Operating LLC completed the sale of $600 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes. The 2028 Senior Notes bear interest at 4.75% and mature on March 15, 2028. Interest on the 2028 Senior Notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, and interest payments will commence on September 15, 2020. The 2028 Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of Clearway Energy Operating LLC and are guaranteed by Clearway Energy LLC and by certain of Clearway Energy Operating LLC's wholly owned current and future subsidiaries. The proceeds from the 2028 Senior Notes were used to partially fund investments into Repowering 1.0, repay the 2024 Senior Notes as described below, and pay transaction fees and expenses. \n \u2022 On December 13, 2019, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $412 million or 82.4%, of the 2024 Senior Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as part of the previously announced cash tender offer. Concurrently with the launch of the tender offer, the Company exercised its right to optionally redeem any 2024 Senior Notes not validly tendered and purchased in the tender offer, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 2024 Senior Notes. This redemption of the remaining $88 million of outstanding 2024 Senior Notes occurred on January 3, 2020. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 10, Long-term Debt. \n \u2022 On December 2, 2019, the Company issued and sold 5,405,405 shares of Class C common stock for net proceeds of $100 million. The Company utilized the proceeds of the offering to acquire 5,405,405 Class C units of Clearway Energy LLC, which used the proceeds to partially fund the acquisition of the Carlsbad Drop Down Asset to pay transaction fees and for general corporate purposes. \n \u2022 In January 2019, the Company repurchased an aggregate principal amount of $50 million of the 2019 Convertible Notes in open market transactions. The repurchases were funded through a partial repayment of the intercompany note between Clearway Operating LLC and Clearway Energy, Inc.

performance as operating revenues less cost of sales, which includes cost of fuel, contract and emission credit amortization and mark-to-market for economic hedging activities.\nEconomic Gross Margin\nIn addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Economic Gross Margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic Gross Margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic Gross Margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that Economic Gross Margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic Gross Margin is defined as energy and capacity revenue, plus other revenues, less cost of fuels. Economic Gross Margin excludes the following components from GAAP gross margin: contract amortization, mark-to-market results, emissions credit amortization and (losses) gains on economic hedging activities. Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled.\nThe below tables present the composition of gross margin, as well as the reconciliation to

The remaining increase in depreciation expense is due to several projects in the Renewables segment reaching COD throughout 2018 and 2019, as well as increased acquisition activity in the Thermal and Conventional segments in 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nImpairment Losses\nThe Company recorded impairment losses of $33 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, of which $19 million relates to a project within Thermal segment and was recorded in connection with the Company entering into a purchase and sale agreement with DB Energy Assets, LLC on September 9, 2019, as further described in Item 15 - Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions.
