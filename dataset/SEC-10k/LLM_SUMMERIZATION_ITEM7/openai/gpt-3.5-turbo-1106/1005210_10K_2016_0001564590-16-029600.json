In addition, our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nProduct Costs and Supply\nThe level of profitability in the retail propane, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and our costs to acquire and transport products. The unit cost of our products, particularly propane, fuel oil and natural gas, is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions, including, but not limited to, economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing. We enter into product supply contracts that are generally one-year agreements subject to annual renewal, and also purchase product on the open market. We attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short-term basis. Our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas (plus transportation costs) at the time of delivery.\nTo supplement our annual purchase requirements, we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers, which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply. The percentage of contract purchases, and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices, will vary from year to year based on market conditions.\nChanges in our costs to acquire and transport products can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product acquisition and transportation cost increases fully or immediately, particularly when such costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as our costs fluctuate with the propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity markets and infrastructure conditions. In addition, periods of sustained higher commodity and/or transportation prices can lead to customer conservation, resulting in reduced demand for our product.\nSeasonality\nThe retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses, as well as the natural gas marketing business, are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings. Historically, approximately two-thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six-month peak heating season from October through March. The fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three-fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between October and March. Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters. Cash flows from operations, therefore, are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season. We expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from April through September (our third and fourth fiscal quarters). To the extent necessary, we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our Common Units in the fourth quarter and the following fiscal year first quarter.\nWeather\nWeather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products, in particular propane, fuel oil and natural gas, for both heating and agricultural purposes. Many of our customers rely heavily on propane, fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source. Accordingly, the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas, which can vary substantially from year to year. In any given area, sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane, fuel oil and natural gas consumption, while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption.\nHedging and Risk Management Activities\nWe engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply. We enter into propane forward, options and swap agreements with third parties, and use futures and options contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d) to purchase and sell propane, fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future. The majority of the futures, forward and options agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory, as well as, in certain instances, forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil. In addition, we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts. Forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures, options and swap contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract through a net settlement mechanism. Although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. Risk management activities are monitored by an internal Commodity Risk Management Committee, made up of six members of management and reporting to our Audit Committee, through enforcement of our Hedging and Risk Management Policy.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements section elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results. Estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, self-insurance and litigation reserves, environmental reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Supervisors. We believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates:\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts, as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write-offs. If the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. As a result of our large customer base, which is comprised of approximately 1.1 million customers, no individual customer account is material. Therefore, while some variation to actual results occurs, historically such variability has not been material. Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. We estimate the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries ( SOA\u201d) issued new mortality tables (RP-2014) and a new mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). We use SOA and other actuarial life expectancy information when developing the annual mortality assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are used to measure net periodic benefit costs and the obligation under these plans. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense. With other assumptions held constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on net pension and postretirement benefit costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Pension Plan Assets and Obligations\u201d below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves. Our accrued self-insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product, workers' compensation and automobile insurance policies. Accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data. For each unasserted claim, we record a self-insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data. Our self-insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development. We maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible, claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers. For the portion of our estimated self-insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles, we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies. Historically, we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly, and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and/or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary. Due to the inherently uncertain nature of, in particular, product liability claims, the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates. However, because of the nature of our insurance arrangements, those material variations historically have not, nor are they expected in the future to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nLoss Contingencies. In the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We record a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes probable and estimable legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.\nWe contribute to multi-employer pension plans ( MEPPs\u201d) in accordance with various collective bargaining agreements covering union employees. As one of the many participating employers in these MEPPs, we are responsible with the other participating employers for any plan underfunding. Due to the uncertainty regarding future factors that could impact the withdrawal liability, we are unable to determine the timing of the payment of the future withdrawal liability, or additional future withdrawal liability, if any.\nFair Values of Acquired Assets and Liabilities. From time to time, we enter into material business combinations. In accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal. Estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment. Estimates most commonly impact property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill. Generally, we have, if necessary, up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair values.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nNet income for fiscal 2016 was $14.4 million, or $0.24 per Common Unit, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.39 per Common Unit, in fiscal 2015.\nNet income and EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) for fiscal 2016 included: (i) a $9.8 million gain from the sale of certain assets and operations in a non-strategic market of the propane segment; (ii) a $6.6 million charge related to the voluntary full withdrawal from a MEPP covering certain employees acquired in the Inergy Propane Acquisition; (iii) a $3.0 million charge related to the settlement of a product liability matter; (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million; and (v) a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nNet income and EBITDA for fiscal 2015 included: (i) a loss on debt extinguishment of $15.1 million; (ii) $11.5 million in expenses related to the integration of Inergy Propane; (iii) an $11.3 million charge related to the voluntary partial withdrawal from a MEPP covering certain employees acquired in the Inergy Propane Acquisition; and (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million.\nExcluding the effects of the foregoing items and unrealized (non-cash) mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments in both years, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) amounted to $223.0 million in fiscal 2016, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $334.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nRetail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 65.6 million gallons, or 13.7%, to 414.8 million gallons. Sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased 11.0 million gallons, or 26.3%, to 30.9 million gallons. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the winter of 2015-2016 was the warmest on record in the contiguous United States. Average temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2016 were 17% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the prior year. While average temperatures were considerably warmer than the prior year in nearly all service\nterritories, California experienced cooler weather compared to the prior year, which contributed to a 13% increase in propane volumes sold in that market.\nRevenues for fiscal 2016 of $1,046.1 million decreased $370.9 million, or 26.2%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower volumes sold, combined with lower retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs.\nCost of products sold for fiscal 2016 of $362.0 million decreased $231.4 million, or 39.0%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower wholesale propane costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Average posted propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) and fuel oil prices were 18.4% and 31.0% lower than the prior year, respectively. Cost of products sold for fiscal 2016 included a $1.2 million unrealized (non-cash) loss attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities, compared to a $1.9 million unrealized (non-cash) gain for fiscal 2015. These unrealized gains and losses are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for both periods in the table below.\nCombined operating and general and administrative expenses of $473.9 million for fiscal 2016 were $38.6 million, or 7.5%, lower than fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the items discussed above in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA from both periods, combined operating and general and administrative expenses decreased 5.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to savings in payroll and benefit-related expenses from a lower headcount, lower vehicle expenses stemming from a reduced vehicle count, as well as lower volume-related variable costs and continued operating efficiencies.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $129.6 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.7 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation expense recorded in the prior year for assets taken out of service. Net interest expense of $75.1 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $2.5 million, or 3.2%, primarily due to savings from the refinancing of certain of our senior notes completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we succeeded in accomplishing many significant goals. The following highlight a few key accomplishments for fiscal 2016:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We acquired the assets and operations of Propane USA Distribution, LLC, which expanded our presence in the South Florida market;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We extended our reach in certain strategic markets that were not previously served by our existing footprint;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We successfully refinanced our revolving credit facility which improved our cost of capital, further extended our debt maturities until 2021 and increased our available borrowing capacity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We made further refinements to our operating model to streamline our operational activities, reduce our cost structure and enhance our position in several markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> We funded all working capital needs from cash on hand without the need to borrow under our revolving credit facility and ended the year with more than $37.0 million of cash.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2017, our anticipated cash requirements include: (i) maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately $38.0 million; (ii) approximately $74.8 million of interest and income tax payments; and (iii) approximately $216.6 million of distributions to Unitholders, assuming distributions remain at the current annualized rate of $3.55 per Common Unit. Based on our current cash position of $37.3 million as of September 24, 2016, availability of funds under the Revolving Credit Facility and expected cash flow from operating activities, we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenues\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars and gallons in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 884,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,176,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (292,811\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58,736\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas and electricity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,219\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,046,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,416,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (370,868\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail gallons sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 414,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 480,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,596\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues decreased $370.9 million, or 26.2%, to $1,046.1 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $1,417.0 million for the prior year due to lower volumes sold driven by record warm temperatures experienced during the fiscal 2016 heating season, combined with lower average selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. As discussed above, average temperatures (as measured in heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2016 were 17% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the prior year. During the heating season (October through March), average temperatures were 18% warmer than normal and 19% warmer than the comparable prior year period. The unseasonably warm weather was persistent as temperatures were warmer than both normal and the prior year throughout the heating season in nearly all of our service territories. While average temperatures were considerably warmer than the prior year in nearly all service territories, California experienced cooler weather compared to the prior year (although temperatures were still 24% warmer than normal), which helped contribute to a 13% year-over-year increase in sales volumes in that market.\nRevenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of $884.2 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $292.8 million, or 24.9%, compared to $1,177.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower retail volumes sold resulting from the impact of record warm temperatures on customer demand for heating needs, coupled with lower average retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. Retail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 65.6 million gallons, or 13.7%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $150.4 million. Average propane selling prices for fiscal 2016 decreased 13.5% compared to the prior year, resulting in a $128.1 million decrease in revenues year-over-year. Included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities of $61.1 million for fiscal 2016, which decreased $14.3 million compared to the prior year.\nRevenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of $68.8 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $58.7 million, or 46.1%, from $127.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes sold resulting from the record warm temperatures discussed above, particularly in the northeast region of the country in which the majority of our fuel oil customers reside, and lower average selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. Fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 11.0 million gallons, or 26.3%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $33.4 million. Average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment decreased 26.9%, resulting in a $25.3 million decrease in revenues.\nRevenues in our natural gas and electricity segment decreased $16.1 million, or 24.1%, to $50.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $66.9 million in the prior year as a result of lower average selling prices for natural gas and electricity associated with lower average wholesale costs, and lower natural gas usage resulting from the warm weather discussed above.\nCost of Products Sold\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 443,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (168,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas and electricity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,637\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,605\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 593,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (231,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane, fuel oil and refined fuels, natural gas and electricity sold, including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products.\nGiven the retail nature of our operations, we maintain a certain level of priced physical inventory to help ensure that our field operations have adequate supply commensurate with the time of year. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to keep our physical inventory priced relatively close to market for our field operations. Consistent with past practices, we principally utilize futures and/or options contracts traded on the NYMEX to mitigate the price risk associated with our priced physical inventory. Under this risk management strategy, realized gains or losses on futures or options contracts, which are reported in cost of products sold, will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold (which may or may not occur in the same accounting period). We do not use futures or options contracts, or other derivative instruments, for speculative trading purposes. Unrealized (non-cash) gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold. Cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization; these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the commodities markets, the downward trend in propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) experienced in fiscal 2015 continued in fiscal 2016 and extended into February 2016. Thereafter, propane prices rallied and generally traded between $0.40 and $0.50 per gallon. Overall, average posted prices for propane and fuel oil for fiscal 2016 were 18.4% and 31.0% lower than the prior year, respectively. The net change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period resulted in unrealized (non-cash) (losses) gains of ($1.2) million and $1.9 million reported in cost of products sold in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an increase of $3.1 million in cost of products sold in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, $2.2 million of which was reported in the propane segment and $0.9 million was reported in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment.\nCost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of $275.1 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $168.4 million, or 38.0%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower wholesale costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Lower average propane costs and lower propane volumes sold during fiscal 2016 resulted in a decrease of $106.8 million and $59.5 million, respectively. Cost of products sold from other propane activities decreased $4.3 million.\nCost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of $42.9 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $49.7 million, or 53.7%, compared to the prior year. Lower fuel oil and refined fuels wholesale costs and lower volumes sold resulted in decreases of $26.2 million and $24.4 million, respectively, in costs of products sold during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of $30.7 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $11.6 million, or 27.5%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity wholesale costs coupled with lower usage.\nTotal cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues decreased 7.3 percentage points to 34.6% in fiscal 2016 from 41.9% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in wholesale costs outpacing the decline in average selling prices.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 412,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 444,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

See Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional discussion.\nGain on Sale of Business\nOn April 22, 2016, we sold certain assets and operations in a non-strategic market of the propane segment for $26.0 million, including $5.0 million of non-compete consideration that will be received over a five-year period, resulting in a gain of $9.8 million that was recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The corresponding net assets and results of operations were not material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishment\nOn March 3, 2016, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ( Amended Credit Agreement\u201d) that provides for a five-year $500.0 million revolving credit facility. In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, we recognized a non-cash charge of $0.3 million to write-off a portion of unamortized debt origination costs of the previous credit agreement.\nOn February 25, 2015, we repurchased and satisfied and discharged all of our previously outstanding 2020 Senior Notes with net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes and cash on hand, pursuant to a tender offer and redemption. In connection with this tender offer and redemption, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of $15.1 million, consisting of $11.1 million for the redemption premium and related fees, as well as the write-off of $2.9 million and $1.1 million in unamortized debt origination costs and unamortized discount, respectively.\nNet Income and Adjusted EBITDA\nNet income for fiscal 2016 amounted to $14.4 million, or $0.24 per Common Unit, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.39 per Common Unit, in fiscal 2015. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) for fiscal 2016 amounted to $219.7 million, compared to $296.0 million for fiscal 2015.\nNet income and EBITDA for fiscal 2016 included: (i) a gain on sale of business of $9.8 million; (ii) a $6.6 million charge related to our voluntary full withdrawal from a MEPP; (iii) a $3.0 million charge related to the settlement of a product liability matter; (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million; and (v) a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million. Net income and EBITDA for fiscal 2015 included: (i) a loss on debt extinguishment of $15.1 million; (ii) $11.5 million in expenses related to the integration of Inergy Propane; (iii) an $11.3 million charge related to our voluntary partial withdrawal from a MEPP; and (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million. Excluding the effects of these items, as well as the unrealized (non-cash) mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments in both years, Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $223.0 million for fiscal 2016, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $334.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nEBITDA represents net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA excluding the unrealized net gain or loss on mark-to-market activity for derivative instruments and other items, as applicable, as provided in the table below. Our management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures of operating performance and we are including them because we believe that they provide our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our operating results. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under US GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with US GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as determined by us excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income, they may not be comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures

$1,938.3 million for the prior year due to lower average propane, fuel oil and refined fuels and natural gas selling prices and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Average temperatures (as measured in heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2015 were 2% warmer than normal and 5% warmer than the prior year. The weather pattern during the fiscal 2015 heating season was characterized by warmer than normal temperatures for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, particularly during the month of December 2014 (December 2014 was 15% warmer than normal and 21% warmer than December 2013), followed by inconsistent temperatures in our eastern and midwestern territories during the latter half of the heating season. We also experienced sustained warmer than normal temperatures in our western territories throughout fiscal 2015 as average temperatures were 23% warmer than normal and 9% warmer than the comparable prior year period.\nRevenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of $1,177.0 million for fiscal 2015 decreased $429.9 million, or 26.8%, compared to $1,606.8 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower average retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale propane costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Average propane selling prices for fiscal 2015 decreased 20.3% compared to the prior year, resulting in a $281.0 million decrease in revenues year-over-year. Retail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2015 decreased 50.4 million gallons, or 9.5%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $145.0 million. Volumes sold during fiscal 2015 were adversely affected by the unseasonably warm weather during key parts of the winter heating season discussed above. Included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities of $75.3 million for fiscal 2015, which decreased $3.9 million compared to the prior year.\nRevenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of $127.5 million for fiscal 2015 decreased $67.2 million, or 34.5%, from $194.7 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower average selling prices and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment decreased 23.2%, resulting in a $38.5 million decrease in revenues. Fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal 2015 decreased 7.2 million gallons, or 14.7%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $28.7 million. The decrease in volumes sold was primarily due to the impact of the unfavorable weather trends discussed above.\nRevenues in our natural gas and electricity segment decreased $20.2 million, or 23.2%, to $66.9 million in fiscal 2015 compared to $87.1 million in the prior year as a result of lower average selling prices for natural gas and electricity as a result of lower average wholesale costs and, to a lesser extent, lower natural gas and electricity usage.\nCost of Products Sold\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 443,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 844,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (401,317\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63,145\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas and electricity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 64,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22,135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (773\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 593,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,080,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (487,370\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom a commodity perspective, propane prices declined rather sharply during the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and continued to trend downward for the remainder of the fiscal year, primarily due to sustained record or near-record high U.S. propane inventories. The movement in commodity prices in fiscal 2015 was in stark contrast to the prior year, when prices were rising rapidly due to industry-wide supply and logistics challenges, particularly during the peak of the fiscal 2014 heating season. Overall, average posted prices for propane (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) and fuel oil prices for fiscal 2015 were 52.7% and 35.5% lower than the prior year, respectively. The net change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period resulted in unrealized (non-cash) gains of $1.9 million and $0.3 million reported in cost of products sold in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, resulting in a decrease of $1.6 million in cost of products sold in fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year, $1.3 million of which was reported in the propane segment and $0.3 million was reported in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment.\nCost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of $443.5 million for fiscal 2015 decreased $401.3 million, or 47.5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to lower wholesale costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Lower average propane costs and lower propane volumes sold during fiscal 2015 resulted in a decrease of $310.3 million and $78.2 million, respectively. Cost of products sold from other propane activities decreased $11.5 million.\nCost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of $92.6 million for fiscal 2015 decreased $63.1 million, or 40.5%, compared to the prior year. Lower fuel oil and refined fuels wholesale costs and lower volumes sold, resulted in decreases of $39.8 million and $23.0 million, respectively, in costs of products sold during fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year.\nCost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of $42.3 million for fiscal 2015 decreased $22.1 million, or 34.3%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity wholesale costs and, to a lesser extent, lower usage.\nTotal cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues decreased 13.9 percentage points to 41.9% in fiscal 2015 from 55.8% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in wholesale costs outpacing the decline in average selling prices in all segments during fiscal 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 444,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 466,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,138\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses of $444.3 million for fiscal 2015 decreased $22.1 million, or 4.7%, compared to $466.4 million in the prior year, primarily due to operating efficiencies and synergies realized as a result of the integration of Inergy Propane; including lower payroll and benefit-related expenses attributable to reduced headcount, lower vehicles expenses attributable to reduced vehicle count and lower fuel costs to operate our fleet, and lower bad debt and insurance expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2015 included expenses of $9.7 million associated with the integration of the Inergy Propane operations, an $11.3 million charge related to our voluntary partial withdrawal from a MEPP, and a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 amounted to $157.1 million, a decrease of $167.1 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower earnings (discussed above) coupled with a lower amount of working capital realized as a result of a lower level of working capital at the beginning of fiscal 2016 compared to the beginning of fiscal 2015. The decline in the amount of working capital was due to the impact of the steep decline in wholesale product costs on our accounts receivable and inventory in fiscal 2015.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities of $53.9 million for fiscal 2016 consisted of $42.9 million for the acquisition of Propane USA and capital expenditures of $38.4 million (including $21.8 million to support the growth of operations and $16.6 million for maintenance expenditures); partially offset by $21.5 million in proceeds from the sale of assets and operations in a non-strategic market and $6.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities of $36.0 million for fiscal 2015 consisted of capital expenditures of $41.2 million (including $21.8 million to support the growth of operations and $19.4 million for maintenance expenditures) and $6.5 million for the acquisition of a business; partially offset by $11.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 of $218.2 million reflects the quarterly distribution to Common Unitholders at a rate of $0.8875 per Common Unit paid in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2016. Upon the execution of the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement on March 3, 2016, we rolled the $100.0 million then-outstanding under the revolving credit facility of the previous credit agreement into the revolving credit facility of the new second amended and restated credit agreement. This resulted in the repayment of the $100.0 million then-outstanding under the revolving credit facility of the previous credit agreement with proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the new credit agreement. Financing activities for fiscal 2016 also reflects the payment of $2.7 million in debt origination costs associated with the refinancing of the credit agreement.\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2015 of $228.5 million reflects the quarterly distribution to Common Unitholders at a rate of $0.8750 per Common Unit paid in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and the first quarter of fiscal 2015, and at a rate of $0.8875 per Common Unit paid in respect of the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015. In addition, cash used in financing activities included proceeds of $250.0 million from the issuance of the 2025 Senior Notes in February 2015 which were used, along with cash on hand, to repurchase and satisfy and discharge all of the previously outstanding 2020 Senior Notes, as well as to pay tender premiums and other related fees of $11.1 million and debt issuance costs of $4.6 million, pursuant to a tender offer and redemption.\nSummary of Long-Term Debt Obligations and Revolving Credit Lines\nAs of September 24, 2016, our long-term debt consisted of $346.2 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.375% senior notes due August 1, 2021 (excluding unamortized premium of $17.0 million), $525.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior\nnotes due June 1, 2024, $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes due March 1, 2025 and $100.0 million outstanding under our senior secured Revolving Credit Facility. See Part IV, Note 8 of this Annual Report.\nThe aggregate amounts of long-term debt maturities subsequent to September 24, 2016 are as follows: fiscal 2017: $-0-; fiscal 2018: $-0-; fiscal 2019: $-0-; fiscal 2020: $-0-; fiscal 2021: $446.2 million; and thereafter: $775.0 million.\nPartnership Distributions\nWe are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our Available Cash, as defined in our Third Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, as amended (the Partnership Agreement\u201d), no more than 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates. Available Cash, as defined in the Partnership Agreement, generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Board of Supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements. These reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business, the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters. The Board of Supervisors reviews the level of Available Cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management.\nOn October 20, 2016, we announced that our Board of Supervisors had declared a quarterly distribution of $0.8875 per Common Unit for the three months ended September 24, 2016. This quarterly distribution rate equates to an annualized rate of $3.55 per Common Unit. The distribution was paid on November 8, 2016 to Common Unitholders of record as of November 1, 2016.\nPension Plan Assets and Obligations\nWe have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was originally designed to cover all of our eligible employees who met certain requirements as to age and length of service. Effective January 1, 1998, we amended the defined benefit pension plan to provide benefits under a cash balance formula as compared to a final average pay formula which was in effect prior to January 1, 1998. Our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective January 1, 2000 and, in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations, effective January 1, 2003, all future service credits were eliminated. Therefore, eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan. We made a minimum required funding payment of $0.7 million in fiscal 2016. There were no such funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2015 or 2014. As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 the plan's projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $49.3 million and $42.6 million, respectively. As a result, the net liability recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the defined benefit pension plan increased by $6.7 million during fiscal 2016, which was primarily attributable to an increase in the benefit obligation as a result of the decrease in discount rates used to measure the obligation, partially offset by a return on plan assets that outpaced the interest cost of the benefit obligation. During fiscal 2017, the Partnership expects to contribute approximately $10.7 million to the defined benefit pension plan in the form of a minimum funding requirement.\nOur investment policies and strategies, as set forth in the Investment Management Policy and Guidelines, are monitored by a Benefits Committee comprised of five members of management. The Benefits Committee employs a liability driven investment strategy, which seeks to increase the correlation of the plan's assets and liabilities to reduce the volatility of the plan's funded status. The execution of this strategy has resulted in an asset allocation that is largely comprised of fixed income securities. A liability driven investment strategy is intended to reduce investment risk and, over the long-term, generate returns on plan assets that largely fund the annual interest on the accumulated benefit obligation. However, as we experienced in recent fiscal years, significant declines in interest rates relevant to our benefit obligations, and/or poor performance in the broader capital markets in which our plan assets are invested, could have an adverse impact on the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan. For purposes of measuring the projected benefit obligation as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, we used a discount rate of 3.125% and 3.875%, respectively, reflecting current market rates for debt obligations of a similar duration to our pension obligations.\nDuring fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, lump sum settlement payments of $5.8 million in each year exceeded the interest and service cost components of the net periodic pension cost. As a result, we recorded a non-cash settlement charge of $2.0 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively, in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan. These unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners' capital and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost. During fiscal 2014, the amount of the pension benefit obligations settled through lump sum payments did not exceed the settlement threshold (combined service and interest costs of net periodic pension cost); therefore, a settlement charge was not required to be recognized.\nWe also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. Partnership employees who were hired prior to July 1993 and retired prior to March 1998 are eligible for health care benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the Partnership. Partnership employees hired prior to July 1993 are eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits if they reach a specified retirement age while working for the Partnership. Effective March 31, 1998, we froze participation\nin our postretirement health care benefit plan, with no new retirees eligible to participate in the plan. All active and eligible employees who were to receive health care benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to March 1, 1998 were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan. Our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded. Effective January 1, 2006, we changed our postretirement health care plan from a self-insured program to one that is fully insured under which we pay a portion of the insurance premium on behalf of the eligible participants.\nLong-Term Debt Obligations and Operating Lease Obligations\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes payments due under our known contractual obligations as of September 24, 2016:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022 and\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 446,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 775,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 136,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,519\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,497\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Self-insurance obligations (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,833\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension contributions (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other contractual obligations (d)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,811\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 115,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 540,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 958,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Payments exclude costs associated with insurance, taxes and maintenance, which are not material to the operating lease obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> The timing of when payments are due for our self-insurance obligations is based on estimates that may differ from when actual payments are made.

Rental expense under operating leases was $29.2 million, $32.7 million and $31.8 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of September 24, 2016 are presented in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGuarantees\nCertain of our operating leases, primarily those for transportation equipment with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal 2023, contain residual value guarantee provisions. Under those provisions, we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount upon completion of the lease period, or we will pay the lessor the difference between fair value and the guaranteed amount. Although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts, the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements, assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term, was approximately $16.0 million. The fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Part IV, Note 2 of this Annual Report.\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides a comprehensive discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company.

OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations, which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nExecutive Overview\nThe following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nProduct Costs and Supply\nThe level of profitability in the retail propane, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and our costs to acquire and transport products. The unit cost of our products, particularly propane, fuel oil and natural gas, is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions, including, but not limited to, economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing. We enter into product supply contracts that are generally one-year agreements subject to annual renewal, and also purchase product on the open market. We attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short-term basis. Our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas (plus transportation costs) at the time of delivery.\nTo supplement our annual purchase requirements, we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers, which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply. The percentage of contract purchases, and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices, will vary from year to year based on market conditions.\nChanges in our costs to acquire and transport products can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product acquisition and transportation cost increases fully or immediately, particularly when such costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as our costs fluctuate with the propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity markets and infrastructure conditions. In addition, periods of sustained higher commodity and/or transportation prices can lead to customer conservation, resulting in reduced demand for our product.\nSeasonality\nThe retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses, as well as the natural gas marketing business, are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings. Historically, approximately two-thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six-month peak heating season from October through March. The fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three-fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between October and March. Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters. Cash flows from operations, therefore, are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season. We expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from April through September (our third and fourth fiscal quarters). To the extent necessary, we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our Common Units in the fourth quarter and the following fiscal year first quarter.\nWeather\nWeather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products, in particular propane, fuel oil and natural gas, for both heating and agricultural purposes. Many of our customers rely heavily on propane, fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source. Accordingly, the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas, which can vary substantially from year to year. In any given area, sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane, fuel oil and natural gas consumption, while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption.\nHedging and Risk Management Activities\nWe engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply. We enter into propane forward, options and swap agreements with third parties, and use futures and options contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d) to purchase and sell propane, fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future. The majority of the futures, forward and options agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory, as well as, in certain instances, forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil. In addition, we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts. Forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures, options and swap contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract through a net settlement mechanism. Although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. Risk management activities are monitored by an internal Commodity Risk Management Committee, made up of six members of management and reporting to our Audit Committee, through enforcement of our Hedging and Risk Management Policy.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements section elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results. Estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, self-insurance and litigation reserves, environmental reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Supervisors. We believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates:\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts, as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write-offs. If the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. As a result of our large customer base, which is comprised of approximately 1.1 million customers, no individual customer account is material. Therefore, while some variation to actual results occurs, historically such variability has not been material. Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. We estimate the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries ( SOA\u201d) issued new mortality tables (RP-2014) and a new mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). We use SOA and other actuarial life expectancy information when developing the annual mortality assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are used to measure net periodic benefit costs and the obligation under these plans. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense. With other assumptions held constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on net pension and postretirement benefit costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Pension Plan Assets and Obligations\u201d below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves. Our accrued self-insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product, workers' compensation and automobile insurance policies. Accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data. For each unasserted claim, we record a self-insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data. Our self-insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development. We maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible, claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers. For the portion of our estimated self-insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles, we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies. Historically, we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly, and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and/or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary. Due to the inherently uncertain nature of, in particular, product liability claims, the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates. However, because of the nature of our insurance arrangements, those material variations historically have not, nor are they expected in the future to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nLoss Contingencies. In the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We record a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes probable and estimable legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.\nWe contribute to multi-employer pension plans ( MEPPs\u201d) in accordance with various collective bargaining agreements covering union employees. As one of the many participating employers in these MEPPs, we are responsible with the other participating employers for any plan underfunding. Due to the uncertainty regarding future factors that could impact the withdrawal liability, we are unable to determine the timing of the payment of the future withdrawal liability, or additional future withdrawal liability, if any.\nFair Values of Acquired Assets and Liabilities. From time to time, we enter into material business combinations. In accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal. Estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment. Estimates most commonly impact property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill. Generally, we have, if necessary, up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair values.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nNet income for fiscal 2016 was $14.4 million, or $0.24 per Common Unit, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.39 per Common Unit, in fiscal 2015.\nNet income and EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) for fiscal 2016 included: (i) a $9.8 million gain from the sale of certain assets and operations in a non-strategic market of the propane segment; (ii) a $6.6 million charge related to the voluntary full withdrawal from a MEPP covering certain employees acquired in the Inergy Propane Acquisition; (iii) a $3.0 million charge related to the settlement of a product liability matter; (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million; and (v) a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nNet income and EBITDA for fiscal 2015 included: (i) a loss on debt extinguishment of $15.1 million; (ii) $11.5 million in expenses related to the integration of Inergy Propane; (iii) an $11.3 million charge related to the voluntary partial withdrawal from a MEPP covering certain employees acquired in the Inergy Propane Acquisition; and (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million.\nExcluding the effects of the foregoing items and unrealized (non-cash) mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments in both years, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) amounted to $223.0 million in fiscal 2016, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $334.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nRetail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 65.6 million gallons, or 13.7%, to 414.8 million gallons. Sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased 11.0 million gallons, or 26.3%, to 30.9 million gallons. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the winter of 2015-2016 was the warmest on record in the contiguous United States. Average temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2016 were 17% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the prior year. While average temperatures were considerably warmer than the prior year in nearly all service\nterritories, California experienced cooler weather compared to the prior year, which contributed to a 13% increase in propane volumes sold in that market.\nRevenues for fiscal 2016 of $1,046.1 million decreased $370.9 million, or 26.2%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower volumes sold, combined with lower retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs.\nCost of products sold for fiscal 2016 of $362.0 million decreased $231.4 million, or 39.0%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower wholesale propane costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Average posted propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) and fuel oil prices were 18.4% and 31.0% lower than the prior year, respectively. Cost of products sold for fiscal 2016 included a $1.2 million unrealized (non-cash) loss attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities, compared to a $1.9 million unrealized (non-cash) gain for fiscal 2015. These unrealized gains and losses are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for both periods in the table below.\nCombined operating and general and administrative expenses of $473.9 million for fiscal 2016 were $38.6 million, or 7.5%, lower than fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the items discussed above in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA from both periods, combined operating and general and administrative expenses decreased 5.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to savings in payroll and benefit-related expenses from a lower headcount, lower vehicle expenses stemming from a reduced vehicle count, as well as lower volume-related variable costs and continued operating efficiencies.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $129.6 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.7 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation expense recorded in the prior year for assets taken out of service. Net interest expense of $75.1 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $2.5 million, or 3.2%, primarily due to savings from the refinancing of certain of our senior notes completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we succeeded in accomplishing many significant goals. The following highlight a few key accomplishments for fiscal 2016:\n \u2022 We acquired the assets and operations of Propane USA Distribution, LLC, which expanded our presence in the South Florida market; \n \u2022 We extended our reach in certain strategic markets that were not previously served by our existing footprint; \n \u2022 We successfully refinanced our revolving credit facility which improved our cost of capital, further extended our debt maturities until 2021 and increased our available borrowing capacity; \n \u2022 We made further refinements to our operating model to streamline our operational activities, reduce our cost structure and enhance our position in several markets; and \n \u2022 We funded all working capital needs from cash on hand without the need to borrow under our revolving credit facility and ended the year with more than $37.0 million of cash. \nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2017, our anticipated cash requirements include: (i) maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately $38.0 million; (ii) approximately $74.8 million of interest and income tax payments; and (iii) approximately $216.6 million of distributions to Unitholders, assuming distributions remain at the current annualized rate of $3.55 per Common Unit. Based on our current cash position of $37.3 million as of September 24, 2016, availability of funds under the Revolving Credit Facility and expected cash flow from operating activities, we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenues decreased $370.9 million, or 26.2%, to $1,046.1 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $1,417.0 million for the prior year due to lower volumes sold driven by record warm temperatures experienced during the fiscal 2016 heating season, combined with lower average selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. As discussed above, average temperatures (as measured in heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2016 were 17% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the prior year. During the heating season (October through March), average temperatures were 18% warmer than normal and 19% warmer than the comparable prior year period. The unseasonably warm weather was persistent as temperatures were warmer than both normal and the prior year throughout the heating season in nearly all of our service territories. While average temperatures were considerably warmer than the prior year in nearly all service territories, California experienced cooler weather compared to the prior year (although temperatures were still 24% warmer than normal), which helped contribute to a 13% year-over-year increase in sales volumes in that market.\nRevenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of $884.2 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $292.8 million, or 24.9%, compared to $1,177.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower retail volumes sold resulting from the impact of record warm temperatures on customer demand for heating needs, coupled with lower average retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. Retail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 65.6 million gallons, or 13.7%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $150.4 million. Average propane selling prices for fiscal 2016 decreased 13.5% compared to the prior year, resulting in a $128.1 million decrease in revenues year-over-year. Included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities of $61.1 million for fiscal 2016, which decreased $14.3 million compared to the prior year.\nRevenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of $68.8 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $58.7 million, or 46.1%, from $127.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes sold resulting from the record warm temperatures discussed above, particularly in the northeast region of the country in which the majority of our fuel oil customers reside, and lower average selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. Fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 11.0 million gallons, or 26.3%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $33.4 million. Average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment decreased 26.9%, resulting in a $25.3 million decrease in revenues.\nRevenues in our natural gas and electricity segment decreased $16.1 million, or 24.1%, to $50.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $66.9 million in the prior year as a result of lower average selling prices for natural gas and electricity associated with lower average wholesale costs, and lower natural gas usage resulting from the warm weather discussed above.\nCost of Products Sold\n\nThe cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane, fuel oil and refined fuels, natural gas and electricity sold, including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products.\nGiven the retail nature of our operations, we maintain a certain level of priced physical inventory to help ensure that our field operations have adequate supply commensurate with the time of year. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to keep our physical inventory priced relatively close to market for our field operations. Consistent with past practices, we principally utilize futures and/or options contracts traded on the NYMEX to mitigate the price risk associated with our priced physical inventory. Under this risk management strategy, realized gains or losses on futures or options contracts, which are reported in cost of products sold, will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold (which may or may not occur in the same accounting period). We do not use futures or options contracts, or other derivative instruments, for speculative trading purposes. Unrealized (non-cash) gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold. Cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization; these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the commodities markets, the downward trend in propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) experienced in fiscal 2015 continued in fiscal 2016 and extended into February 2016. Thereafter, propane prices rallied and generally traded between $0.40 and $0.50 per gallon. Overall, average posted prices for propane and fuel oil for fiscal 2016 were 18.4% and 31.0% lower than the prior year, respectively. The net change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period resulted in unrealized (non-cash) (losses) gains of ($1.2) million and $1.9 million reported in cost of products sold in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an increase of $3.1 million in cost of products sold in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, $2.2 million of which was reported in the propane segment and $0.9 million was reported in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment.\nCost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of $275.1 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $168.4 million, or 38.0%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower wholesale costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Lower average propane costs and lower propane volumes sold during fiscal 2016 resulted in a decrease of $106.8 million and $59.5 million, respectively. Cost of products sold from other propane activities decreased $4.3 million.\nCost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of $42.9 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $49.7 million, or 53.7%, compared to the prior year. Lower fuel oil and refined fuels wholesale costs and lower volumes sold resulted in decreases of $26.2 million and $24.4 million, respectively, in costs of products sold during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of $30.7 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $11.6 million, or 27.5%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity wholesale costs coupled with lower usage.\nTotal cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues decreased 7.3 percentage points to 34.6% in fiscal 2016 from 41.9% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in wholesale costs outpacing the decline in average selling prices.\nOperating Expenses\n\nAll costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. These operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel, costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet, overhead and other costs of our purchasing, training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers.\nOperating expenses of $412.8 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $31.5 million, or 7.1%, compared to $444.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower payroll and benefit-related expenses attributable to reduced headcount, lower variable compensation associated with lower earnings, lower vehicle expenses due to reduced vehicle count and lower fuel costs to operate our fleet; offset to an extent by an increase in insurance and product liability expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 included a $6.6 million accrual for our voluntary full withdrawal from a MEPP, a charge of $3.0 million related to the settlement of a product liability matter, and a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million.

In addition, our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of this Annual Report.\nProduct Costs and Supply\nThe level of profitability in the retail propane, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and our costs to acquire and transport products. The unit cost of our products, particularly propane, fuel oil and natural gas, is subject to volatility as a result of supply and demand dynamics or other market conditions, including, but not limited to, economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing. We enter into product supply contracts that are generally one-year agreements subject to annual renewal, and also purchase product on the open market. We attempt to reduce price risk by pricing product on a short-term basis. Our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Conway, Kansas (plus transportation costs) at the time of delivery.\nTo supplement our annual purchase requirements, we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers, which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply. The percentage of contract purchases, and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices, will vary from year to year based on market conditions.\nChanges in our costs to acquire and transport products can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product acquisition and transportation cost increases fully or immediately, particularly when such costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as our costs fluctuate with the propane, fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity markets and infrastructure conditions. In addition, periods of sustained higher commodity and/or transportation prices can lead to customer conservation, resulting in reduced demand for our product.\nSeasonality\nThe retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses, as well as the natural gas marketing business, are seasonal because these fuels are primarily used for heating in residential and commercial buildings. Historically, approximately two-thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six-month peak heating season from October through March. The fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three-fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between October and March. Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters. Cash flows from operations, therefore, are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season. We expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from April through September (our third and fourth fiscal quarters). To the extent necessary, we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our Common Units in the fourth quarter and the following fiscal year first quarter.\nWeather\nWeather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products, in particular propane, fuel oil and natural gas, for both heating and agricultural purposes. Many of our customers rely heavily on propane, fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source. Accordingly, the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas, which can vary substantially from year to year. In any given area, sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane, fuel oil and natural gas consumption, while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption.\nHedging and Risk Management Activities\nWe engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply. We enter into propane forward, options and swap agreements with third parties, and use futures and options contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX\u201d) to purchase and sell propane, fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future. The majority of the futures, forward and options agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory, as well as, in certain instances, forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil. In addition, we sell propane and fuel oil to customers at fixed prices, and enter into derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices as a result of selling the fixed price contracts. Forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract whereas futures, options and swap contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract through a net settlement mechanism. Although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. Risk management activities are monitored by an internal Commodity Risk Management Committee, made up of six members of management and reporting to our Audit Committee, through enforcement of our Hedging and Risk Management Policy.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements section elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results. Estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, employee benefit plans, self-insurance and litigation reserves, environmental reserves, allowances for doubtful accounts, asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us. Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Supervisors. We believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates:\nAllowances for Doubtful Accounts. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts, as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write-offs. If the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required. As a result of our large customer base, which is comprised of approximately 1.1 million customers, no individual customer account is material. Therefore, while some variation to actual results occurs, historically such variability has not been material. Schedule II, Valuation and Qualifying Accounts, provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. We estimate the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs. In October 2014, the Society of Actuaries ( SOA\u201d) issued new mortality tables (RP-2014) and a new mortality improvement scale (MP-2014). We use SOA and other actuarial life expectancy information when developing the annual mortality assumptions for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, which are used to measure net periodic benefit costs and the obligation under these plans. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense. With other assumptions held constant, an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in the discount rate would have an immaterial impact on net pension and postretirement benefit costs. See Liquidity and Capital Resources-Pension Plan Assets and Obligations\u201d below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves. Our accrued self-insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product, workers' compensation and automobile insurance policies. Accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data. For each unasserted claim, we record a self-insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data. Our self-insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development. We maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible, claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers. For the portion of our estimated self-insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles, we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies. Historically, we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported. Accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly, and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and/or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary. Due to the inherently uncertain nature of, in particular, product liability claims, the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates. However, because of the nature of our insurance arrangements, those material variations historically have not, nor are they expected in the future to have, a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nLoss Contingencies. In the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings. We record a liability for such matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The liability includes probable and estimable legal costs to the point in the legal matter where we believe a conclusion to the matter will be reached. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.\nWe contribute to multi-employer pension plans ( MEPPs\u201d) in accordance with various collective bargaining agreements covering union employees. As one of the many participating employers in these MEPPs, we are responsible with the other participating employers for any plan underfunding. Due to the uncertainty regarding future factors that could impact the withdrawal liability, we are unable to determine the timing of the payment of the future withdrawal liability, or additional future withdrawal liability, if any.\nFair Values of Acquired Assets and Liabilities. From time to time, we enter into material business combinations. In accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal. Estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment. Estimates most commonly impact property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including goodwill. Generally, we have, if necessary, up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair values.\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition\nNet income for fiscal 2016 was $14.4 million, or $0.24 per Common Unit, compared to $84.4 million, or $1.39 per Common Unit, in fiscal 2015.\nNet income and EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) for fiscal 2016 included: (i) a $9.8 million gain from the sale of certain assets and operations in a non-strategic market of the propane segment; (ii) a $6.6 million charge related to the voluntary full withdrawal from a MEPP covering certain employees acquired in the Inergy Propane Acquisition; (iii) a $3.0 million charge related to the settlement of a product liability matter; (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million; and (v) a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.\nNet income and EBITDA for fiscal 2015 included: (i) a loss on debt extinguishment of $15.1 million; (ii) $11.5 million in expenses related to the integration of Inergy Propane; (iii) an $11.3 million charge related to the voluntary partial withdrawal from a MEPP covering certain employees acquired in the Inergy Propane Acquisition; and (iv) a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million.\nExcluding the effects of the foregoing items and unrealized (non-cash) mark-to-market adjustments on derivative instruments in both years, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined and reconciled below) amounted to $223.0 million in fiscal 2016, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $334.0 million in fiscal 2015.\nRetail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 65.6 million gallons, or 13.7%, to 414.8 million gallons. Sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased 11.0 million gallons, or 26.3%, to 30.9 million gallons. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the winter of 2015-2016 was the warmest on record in the contiguous United States. Average temperatures (as measured by heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2016 were 17% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the prior year. While average temperatures were considerably warmer than the prior year in nearly all service\nterritories, California experienced cooler weather compared to the prior year, which contributed to a 13% increase in propane volumes sold in that market.\nRevenues for fiscal 2016 of $1,046.1 million decreased $370.9 million, or 26.2%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the lower volumes sold, combined with lower retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs.\nCost of products sold for fiscal 2016 of $362.0 million decreased $231.4 million, or 39.0%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower wholesale propane costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Average posted propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) and fuel oil prices were 18.4% and 31.0% lower than the prior year, respectively. Cost of products sold for fiscal 2016 included a $1.2 million unrealized (non-cash) loss attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities, compared to a $1.9 million unrealized (non-cash) gain for fiscal 2015. These unrealized gains and losses are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA for both periods in the table below.\nCombined operating and general and administrative expenses of $473.9 million for fiscal 2016 were $38.6 million, or 7.5%, lower than fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the items discussed above in the computation of Adjusted EBITDA from both periods, combined operating and general and administrative expenses decreased 5.2% compared to the prior year, primarily due to savings in payroll and benefit-related expenses from a lower headcount, lower vehicle expenses stemming from a reduced vehicle count, as well as lower volume-related variable costs and continued operating efficiencies.\nDepreciation and amortization expense of $129.6 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $3.7 million, or 2.8%, primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation expense recorded in the prior year for assets taken out of service. Net interest expense of $75.1 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $2.5 million, or 3.2%, primarily due to savings from the refinancing of certain of our senior notes completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the refinancing of our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we succeeded in accomplishing many significant goals. The following highlight a few key accomplishments for fiscal 2016:\n \u2022 We acquired the assets and operations of Propane USA Distribution, LLC, which expanded our presence in the South Florida market; \n \u2022 We extended our reach in certain strategic markets that were not previously served by our existing footprint; \n \u2022 We successfully refinanced our revolving credit facility which improved our cost of capital, further extended our debt maturities until 2021 and increased our available borrowing capacity; \n \u2022 We made further refinements to our operating model to streamline our operational activities, reduce our cost structure and enhance our position in several markets; and \n \u2022 We funded all working capital needs from cash on hand without the need to borrow under our revolving credit facility and ended the year with more than $37.0 million of cash. \nAs we look ahead to fiscal 2017, our anticipated cash requirements include: (i) maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately $38.0 million; (ii) approximately $74.8 million of interest and income tax payments; and (iii) approximately $216.6 million of distributions to Unitholders, assuming distributions remain at the current annualized rate of $3.55 per Common Unit. Based on our current cash position of $37.3 million as of September 24, 2016, availability of funds under the Revolving Credit Facility and expected cash flow from operating activities, we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenues\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars and gallons in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 884,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,176,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (292,811\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 127,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58,736\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (46.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas and electricity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,102\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,219\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,046,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,416,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (370,868\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Retail gallons sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 414,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 480,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,596\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,000\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenues decreased $370.9 million, or 26.2%, to $1,046.1 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $1,417.0 million for the prior year due to lower volumes sold driven by record warm temperatures experienced during the fiscal 2016 heating season, combined with lower average selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. As discussed above, average temperatures (as measured in heating degree days) across all of our service territories for fiscal 2016 were 17% warmer than normal and 15% warmer than the prior year. During the heating season (October through March), average temperatures were 18% warmer than normal and 19% warmer than the comparable prior year period. The unseasonably warm weather was persistent as temperatures were warmer than both normal and the prior year throughout the heating season in nearly all of our service territories. While average temperatures were considerably warmer than the prior year in nearly all service territories, California experienced cooler weather compared to the prior year (although temperatures were still 24% warmer than normal), which helped contribute to a 13% year-over-year increase in sales volumes in that market.\nRevenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of $884.2 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $292.8 million, or 24.9%, compared to $1,177.0 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower retail volumes sold resulting from the impact of record warm temperatures on customer demand for heating needs, coupled with lower average retail selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. Retail propane gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 65.6 million gallons, or 13.7%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $150.4 million. Average propane selling prices for fiscal 2016 decreased 13.5% compared to the prior year, resulting in a $128.1 million decrease in revenues year-over-year. Included within the propane segment are revenues from other propane activities of $61.1 million for fiscal 2016, which decreased $14.3 million compared to the prior year.\nRevenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of $68.8 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $58.7 million, or 46.1%, from $127.5 million for the prior year, primarily due to lower volumes sold resulting from the record warm temperatures discussed above, particularly in the northeast region of the country in which the majority of our fuel oil customers reside, and lower average selling prices associated with lower wholesale costs. Fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal 2016 decreased 11.0 million gallons, or 26.3%, resulting in a decrease in revenues of $33.4 million. Average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment decreased 26.9%, resulting in a $25.3 million decrease in revenues.\nRevenues in our natural gas and electricity segment decreased $16.1 million, or 24.1%, to $50.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $66.9 million in the prior year as a result of lower average selling prices for natural gas and electricity associated with lower average wholesale costs, and lower natural gas usage resulting from the warm weather discussed above.\nCost of Products Sold\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Propane\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 275,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 443,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (168,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuel oil and refined fuels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Natural gas and electricity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,637\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,605\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of products sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 361,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 593,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (231,427\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane, fuel oil and refined fuels, natural gas and electricity sold, including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products.\nGiven the retail nature of our operations, we maintain a certain level of priced physical inventory to help ensure that our field operations have adequate supply commensurate with the time of year. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to keep our physical inventory priced relatively close to market for our field operations. Consistent with past practices, we principally utilize futures and/or options contracts traded on the NYMEX to mitigate the price risk associated with our priced physical inventory. Under this risk management strategy, realized gains or losses on futures or options contracts, which are reported in cost of products sold, will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold (which may or may not occur in the same accounting period). We do not use futures or options contracts, or other derivative instruments, for speculative trading purposes. Unrealized (non-cash) gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold. Cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization; these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the commodities markets, the downward trend in propane prices (basis Mont Belvieu, Texas) experienced in fiscal 2015 continued in fiscal 2016 and extended into February 2016. Thereafter, propane prices rallied and generally traded between $0.40 and $0.50 per gallon. Overall, average posted prices for propane and fuel oil for fiscal 2016 were 18.4% and 31.0% lower than the prior year, respectively. The net change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period resulted in unrealized (non-cash) (losses) gains of ($1.2) million and $1.9 million reported in cost of products sold in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, resulting in an increase of $3.1 million in cost of products sold in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, $2.2 million of which was reported in the propane segment and $0.9 million was reported in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment.\nCost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of $275.1 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $168.4 million, or 38.0%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower wholesale costs and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes sold. Lower average propane costs and lower propane volumes sold during fiscal 2016 resulted in a decrease of $106.8 million and $59.5 million, respectively. Cost of products sold from other propane activities decreased $4.3 million.\nCost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of $42.9 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $49.7 million, or 53.7%, compared to the prior year. Lower fuel oil and refined fuels wholesale costs and lower volumes sold resulted in decreases of $26.2 million and $24.4 million, respectively, in costs of products sold during fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year.\nCost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of $30.7 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $11.6 million, or 27.5%, compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower natural gas and electricity wholesale costs coupled with lower usage.\nTotal cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues decreased 7.3 percentage points to 34.6% in fiscal 2016 from 41.9% in the prior year, primarily due to the decline in wholesale costs outpacing the decline in average selling prices.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 412,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 444,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percent of total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. These operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel, costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet, overhead and other costs of our purchasing, training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers.\nOperating expenses of $412.8 million for fiscal 2016 decreased $31.5 million, or 7.1%, compared to $444.3 million in the prior year, primarily due to lower payroll and benefit-related expenses attributable to reduced headcount, lower variable compensation associated with lower earnings, lower vehicle expenses due to reduced vehicle count and lower fuel costs to operate our fleet; offset to an extent by an increase in insurance and product liability expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2016 included a $6.6 million accrual for our voluntary full withdrawal from a MEPP, a charge of $3.0 million related to the settlement of a product liability matter, and a pension settlement charge of $2.0 million.
