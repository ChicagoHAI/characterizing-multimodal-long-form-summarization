In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nQuotient Technology Inc., is a provider of an industry leading digital platform that enables consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands and retailers to engage shoppers through personalized and targeted promotions and media. Through our platform, CPGs and retailers are able to use online and in-store point-of-sale (POS) shopper data and analytics to drive sales with improved efficiency, as compared to traditional offline promotional and advertising vehicles.\nWe operate our platform across a broad distribution network, reaching over 40 million shoppers at the critical moments in their paths to purchase. Our network includes our website and mobile properties of our flagship consumer brand, Coupons.com, as well as our other owned and operated properties, and thousands of our publisher partners. In addition, we operate our platform, Retailer iQ, on a co-branded or white label basis with our retailer partners, providing them a digital platform to directly engage their shoppers across their websites, mobile, ecommerce, and social channels. Retailer iQ integrates with retailers' POS technology and leverages a broad set of shopper insights, including online behaviors, purchase, and purchase intent data to drive personalized and targeted promotions and media. Retailers using Retailer iQ are primarily in the grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise channels where the majority of CPG products are sold.\nOur network is made up of three constituencies: over 2,000 brands from approximately 700 CPGs; retailers across multiple classes of trade such as grocery, drug, dollar, club, and mass merchandise channels; and consumers visiting our web, mobile properties, social channels, as well as those of our CPGs and retailers.\nOur CPG customers include many of the leading food, beverage, drug, personal and household product manufacturers. We primarily generate revenue from CPGs by offering promotions and media content to consumers across our network. Our retailers include leading grocery, drug, dollar channel, club and mass merchandise retailers. We also service a broad range of specialty retailers, including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others, through which we generate revenue primarily from offering coupon codes through our platform.\nWe generate promotion revenues from digital transactions on our network. Each time a consumer activates a digital coupon on our platform we are generally paid a fee. Activation of a digital coupon can include: printing it for physical redemption at a retailer, saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption, or using a mobile device to scan a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase for automatic digital redemption and cash back. As our business evolves, we will continue to experiment with different pricing models and fee arrangements with CPGs and retailers which may impact how we monetize transactions. Promotion revenues includes revenues from coupon code offerings in which we are generally paid a fee when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform. We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers or publishers when a consumer activates a digital promotion on their website or mobile app. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics\u201d for more information.\nWe also generate media revenue through the placement of online advertisements from CPGs and retailers that are displayed on our websites and mobile apps, as well as those of our publishers, retailers and other third parties.\nOur operating expenses may increase in the future as we continue (1) to invest in (i) research and development to enhance our platform and investments in newer product offerings including Quotient Insights; (ii) sales and marketing to acquire new CPG and retailer customers and increase revenues from our existing customers; and, (iii) corporate infrastructure; (2) to incur additional general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting expenses, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (3) to amortize expenses related to intangibles assets associated with a services and data agreement and other strategic acquisitions.\nFor 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenues were $275.2 million, $237.3 million, and $221.8 million, respectively. Our net loss for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $19.5 million, $26.7 million, and $23.4 million, respectively.\nNon- GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics\nAdjusted Earnings Before Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, to develop short and long-term operational plans, and to determine bonus payouts. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial metric used by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, because such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and can vary significantly between periods. Additionally, it excludes the effects of interest, income taxes, gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name, other income (expense), net, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, and charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs.\nWe define a transaction\u201d as any action that generates revenue, directly or indirectly, including per item transaction fees, set up fees, volume-based fixed fees and revenue sharing. Transactions continue to exclude retailer offers that generate no direct revenue. Transactions indirectly generate revenue when the action is not paid for on a per item basis, but is part of an agreement which generates revenue for offer services; for example, transactions after a fixed fee cap has been reached would be included in our definition. This definition of transaction does not impact the number of transactions reported in prior filings. While the number of transactions on our platform has been an important indicator of our ability to grow our revenues, as our business continues to evolve and we experiment with different pricing models to monetize transactions, we believe transaction volume on our platform may become a less predictive indicator of future operating performance.\nNet loss, Adjusted EBITDA and number of transactions for each of the periods presented were as follows:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,479\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26,730\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,444\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,445,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,657,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,608,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with GAAP based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nObtaining high quality coupons and increasing the number of CPG-authorized activations. Our ability to grow revenue will depend upon our ability to continue to obtain high quality coupons and increase the number of CPG-authorized activations available through our platform. If we are unable to obtain high quality coupons and increase the number of CPG-authorized activations, we will not be able to increase the number of transactions and the growth in our revenue will be adversely affected.\nIncreasing revenue from CPGs on our platform. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future depends upon our ability to continue to increase revenues from existing CPGs on our platform. This includes increasing our share of CPG spending on overall coupons, media and trade promotions; increasing the number of brands that are using our platform within each CPG; increasing media spending on our platform; and increase our share of retailer spending on coupon codes. As transactions grow, volume discounts that we offer to our existing CPGs, may slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues on a per transaction basis.\nVariability in promotional spend by CPGs. Our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in promotional spending budgets of CPGs and retailers and the timing of their promotional spending. Decisions by major CPGs or retailers to delay or reduce their promotional and media spending, move campaigns, or divert spending away from digital promotions or media could slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues.\nAbility to scale Retailer iQ and further integrate with Retailers. Our ability to grow our revenues will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully implement and scale Retailer iQ among retailers. If we are unable to continue to successfully implement Retailer iQ, if the implementation or marketing of Retailer iQ is delayed or it is not adopted and supported with sufficient resources by retailers, the growth in our revenues will be adversely affected. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future is also dependent upon our ability to further integrate digital promotions and media into retailers' loyalty or point of sale systems and other channels so that CPGs and retailers can more effectively engage consumers and drive their own sales.\nGrowth of our consumer selection and digital offerings. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future will depend on our ability to innovate and invest in promotion and media solutions, including Retailer iQ, mobile solutions for consumers, including digital print, mobile solutions and digital promotion offerings for specialty/franchise retail, including coupon codes, leverage our reach to consumers and the strength of our platform to broaden the selection and use of coupon codes by consumers, manage the transition from digital print coupons to digital paperless coupons as well as the transition from desktop to mobile platforms, and invest in emerging solutions around our data and analytic capabilities, referred to as Quotient Insights, for CPGs and retailers.\nInternational Growth and Acquisitions. Our ability to grow our revenues will also depend on our ability to grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and expand our business through selective acquisitions, similar to our acquisition of Shopmium, and their integration with the core business of the company.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues by delivering digital coupons, including coupons and coupon codes, and digital media through our platform. CPGs and retailers choose one or more of our offerings and are charged a fee for each selected offering. Our customers generally submit insertion orders that outline the terms and conditions of a campaign, including the channels through which the campaign will be run, the offerings for each selected channel, the type of content to be delivered, the timeframe of the campaign, the number of authorized activations and the pricing of the campaign. Substantially all of our revenues are generated from sales in the United States.\nCoupons. We generate revenues, as consumers select, activate, or redeem a coupon through our platform by either printing it for physical redemption at a retailer or saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption. For setup fees, we recognize revenues proportionally, on a per activation basis, using the number of authorized activations per insertion order, commencing on the date of the first coupon activation. For coupons, the pricing is generally determined on a per unit activation basis. Setup fees charged to customers represent charges for the creation of digital coupons and related activation, tracking and security features. Insertion orders generally include a limit on the number of activations, or times consumers may select a coupon.\nCoupon Codes. We generally generate revenues when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform and completion of the order is reported to us. In the same period that we recognize revenues for the delivery of coupon codes, we also estimate and record a reserve, based upon historical experience, to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns which may not be reported until a subsequent date.\nDigital Media. Our media services enable CPGs and retailers to distribute digital media to promote their brands and products on our websites, and mobile apps, and through a network of our publishers and non-publisher third parties that display our media offerings on their websites or mobile apps. We charge a fee for these media campaigns, the pricing of which is based on the advertisement size and position. Related fees are generally billed monthly, based on a per-campaign, per-impressions or per-click basis.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes the costs resulting from distribution fees. If we deliver a digital coupon or media on a retailer's website or mobile apps or through its loyalty program, or the website or mobile apps of a publisher, we generally pay a distribution fee to the retailer or publisher which is included in our cost of revenues. These costs are expensed as incurred. We generally do not pay a distribution fee for a coupon or code which is offered through the website of the CPG or retailer that is offering the coupon or coupon code. From time to time, we have entered into arrangements pursuant to which we have agreed to the payment of minimum distribution or other service fees that are included in our cost of revenues. Distribution fees as a percent of total revenues were 23%, 16% and 15% during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCost of revenues also includes personnel costs, depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, software and acquired intangible assets incurred on revenue producing technologies, data center costs and third-party service fees. Personnel costs related to costs of revenues include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. These costs are primarily attributable to individuals maintaining our data centers and members of our network operations group, which initiates, sets up and delivers digital promotion and media campaigns. Cost of revenues also includes third-party data center costs. We capitalize costs related to software that is developed or obtained for internal use, including Retailer iQ and Quotient Insights. Costs incurred in connection with internal software development for revenue producing technologies are capitalized and are amortized in cost of revenues over the internal use software's useful life. The amortization of these costs begins when the internally developed software is ready for its intended use.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses primarily into three categories: sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, professional fees and facilities expense. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses generally include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including commissions), brand marketing, and, to a lesser extent, costs associated with professional services, travel, trade shows and marketing materials. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and continue to expand our marketing related programs designed to increase our revenues.\nResearch and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related headcount costs and costs of professional services associated with the ongoing development of our technology. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and employee benefit costs. Our developers reside in our Mountain View, California headquarters, Paris, France, which was acquired as part of our acquisition of Shopmium and our research and development center in Bangalore, India which we opened in January 2015. We anticipate growing employee headcount in India during 2017.\nWe believe that continued investment in technology is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. We also believe that continued operational and cost optimization efforts, is important, as it provides us with the ability to invest in strategic areas, while managing growth in future periods.\nGeneral and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and other corporate expenses. We expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses in future periods as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting costs, investor relations costs, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChange in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net. The change in fair value of escrowed shares relates to the acquisition of certain exclusivity rights under a services and data agreement whereby a certain amount of shares were issued and placed in escrow. Those shares are subject to re-measurement until released from escrow. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is the result of our re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of the assets of Eckim, in August 2014, and from the acquisition of Shopmium, in October 2015. The contingent consideration related to Eckim was determined based on an estimate of shares issuable to Eckim for achieving certain revenue and profit milestones at the end of the earnout period as of December 31, 2015. The inputs include the Company's stock price and the number of shares issuable. On January 26, 2016, the Company and the sellers of Eckim agreed on performance against the milestones and the shares to be issued. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the contingent liability of $1.9 million related to Eckim to stockholder's equity in the first quarter of 2016. The shares were issued during the second quarter of 2016.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense is primarily related to our debt obligations related to an outstanding credit agreement. All debt was repaid in the third quarter of 2015 and the credit agreement was terminated.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, includes interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a net increase in deferred tax liabilities associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and a decrease in foreign income taxed at non-US tax rates. The benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arose from a loss the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and net foreign tax benefit, partially offset by state income taxes. The provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities that arose from the gain the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations and our

The increase was primarily due to higher distribution fees of $23.0 million attributable to an increase in fees of $15.6 million primarily due to higher number of transactions completed through our platform that are subject to fees on third-party sites, a one-time charge of $7.4 million associated with certain distribution fees under an arrangement with a retailer partner, as discussed in detail in Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), an increase in amortization expense of $2.5 million related to certain exclusive rights acquired under a services and data agreement executed during the third quarter of 2016, an increase in expenses related to Shopmium of $1.5 million and an increase in amortization expense of $1.0 million associated with our Retailer iQ platform, partially offset by a decrease in outsourced data center services fees used to support our business of $5.0 million and reduction in expensed computer supplies of $0.3 million.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 58% from 61%, as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a one-time charge associated with certain distribution fees under an arrangement with a retailer partner, increase in amortization expense related to certain exclusive rights acquired under a services and data agreement, partially offset by decreased outsourced data center services fees and the benefit from leveraging fixed costs.\nWe expect the costs associated with distribution and third-party service fees, to continue to increase in the future as we continue to expand and scale our distribution network and reach, and to pursue opportunities to expand our business through selective acquisitions. We expect the increase in distribution and third-party service fees, to be partially offset by the decrease in amortization expense for internally developed software.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nCost of revenues increased by $6.0 million, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher distributions and third-party service fees of $6.6 million, an increase in costs associated with the deployment of Retailer iQ of $1.7 million, as a result of the deployment of Retailer iQ in the first quarter of 2014 and our development of new features and functionality of the platform, partially offset by a decrease in third-party support services of $3.0 million, facilitated by the investment we are making in our business operational service infrastructure, including our operational center in Bangalore, India, and decrease in stock-based compensation of $1.4 million.\nGross margin for the year ended December 31, 2015 remained flat at 61%, as compared to 2014, resulting from the effect from the benefit of decreased headcount related expenses and expense leverage from fixed costs that was mainly offset by the impact from the increase in distribution and third-party service fees, and costs associated with the deployment of Retailer iQ.\nSales and Marketing\nTable 215: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,596\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 92,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percent of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nSales and marketing expenses increased modestly by $0.1 million and, remained relatively flat, during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015.

The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration during 2014 was primarily driven by the decrease in the likelihood of Eckim achieving certain post-acquisition revenue and profit milestones.\nInterest Expense and Other Income (Expense), Net\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (290\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (922\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of a right to use a web\ndomain name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,800\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (72\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,350\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (994\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,993\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (552\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> * not meaningful\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nThe decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, was due to repayment in full of $7.5 million in borrowings in the third quarter of 2015. The gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name during the year ended December 31, 2015 was the result of a $4.8 million gain realized from the sale of a right to use a web domain name through a competitive public auction process. The change in other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, is associated with interest income earned on short-term certificate of deposits and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily due to the net effect from lower interest expense associated with the early retirement of $15.0 million in borrowings in the third quarter of 2014 and the repayment of $7.5 million in borrowings in the third quarter of 2015. The gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name, during the year ended December 31, 2015, was the result of a $4.8 million gain realized from the sale of a right to use a web domain name through a competitive public auction process.\nProvision for (benefit from) Income Taxes\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (561\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,487\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (129\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared to 2015\nThe income tax provision of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a net increase in deferred tax liabilities associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and a decrease in foreign income taxed at non-US tax rates. The benefit from income taxes during 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arose from a loss the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and net foreign tax benefit, partially offset by state income taxes.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nThe benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million during 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arose from a loss the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the Eckim acquisition and net foreign tax benefit, partially offset by state income taxes. Our provision for income taxes of $1.9 million during 2014 is primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities that arose from the gain the Company recorded from a change in fair value of contingent consideration related to the Eckim acquisition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, our principal source of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and short-term investments totaling $175.3 million, which were held for working capital purposes.\nIn the near term, although we intend to continue to manage our operating expenses in line with our existing cash and available financial resources, we anticipate we will incur increased spending in future periods in order to execute our long-term business plan and to support our growth and the costs associated with being a public company. As a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, regulatory compliance and other costs that we did not incur in the periods prior to our IPO with higher increases in future periods as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting costs, investor relations costs, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, we may use cash to fund acquisitions or invest in other businesses, repurchase the Company's common stock under the publically announced share repurchase program and incur capital expenditures including leasehold improvements or technologies.\nPrior to our IPO, we financed our operations and capital expenditures through private sales of preferred stock, term debt financing, exercise of stock options and cash flows from operations. In March 2014, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 12,075,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share for which we received proceeds of $179.7 million, which is net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $13.5 million, but before deducting offering expenses of $5.4 million.\nIn 2015, we terminated our revolving line of credit facility with a commercial bank, and paid in full, all of $7.5 million outstanding under the facility. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, there are no amounts outstanding or available under the line of credit.\nIn February 2015, our board of directors authorized the Program to repurchase up to $50.0 million of the Company's common stock through February 2016, subject to certain limitations. Through February 2016, a total of $31.3 million in stock was repurchased under this Program. The Program expired in February 2016 with an unused balance of $18.7 million. In February 2016, our board of directors authorized the New Program to repurchase up to $50.0 million of the Company's common stock through February 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company repurchased shares of its common stock for an aggregate amount of $11.1 million. As of December 31, 2016, a total of $46.8 million remains available for future share repurchases under the New Program.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,559\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50,812\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23,032\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (24,577\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 173,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effects of exchange rates on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,773\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (66,128\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business and the increase in our revenues. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities has typically been due to our net losses and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly accounts receivable and accrued liabilities, adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net and gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name.\nDuring 2016, net cash provided by operating activities of $21.8 million, reflects our net loss of $19.5 million adjusted for net non-cash expenses of $53.4 million, partially offset by cash used as a result of changes in working capital of $12.1 million. Non-cash expenses included depreciation and amortization from capital expenditures and headcount growth, primarily related to continued investment in our business, stock-based compensation, one-time charge for certain distribution fees under an arrangement with a retailer partner, change in the fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, loss on disposal of property and equipment, deferred income taxes and recovery from allowance for doubtful accounts. The use of cash from the net change in working capital items included, most notably an increase in accounts receivable of $9.4 million, a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits of $1.9 million, a decrease in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $1.7 million, and a decrease in deferred revenues of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.4 million related to the timing of payments.\nDuring 2015, cash provided by operating activities was approximately $9.2 million, reflecting our net loss of $26.7 million, offset by net non-cash expenses of $45.7 million, which included depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt issuance costs, and change in the fair value of the contingent consideration, offset by a gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name which is a reclassification of cash flows to investing activities, deferred income taxes, recoveries of allowances for doubtful accounts and loss on disposal of property and equipment. The use of cash from the net change in working capital items included, most notably an increase in accounts receivable of $12.8 million due to an increase in billing for media campaigns as well as timing of payments and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.2 million related to the timing of payments, offset by an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of $3.0 million and increase in deferred revenues of $1.2 million and accrued compensation and benefits of $0.1 million.\nDuring 2014, cash provided by operating activities amounted to $11.5 million, reflecting our net loss of $23.4 million, offset by net non-cash expenses of $46.8 million, which included depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, allowance for doubtful accounts, accretion of debt discount, amortization of debt issuance costs and loss on disposal of property and equipment, partially offset by the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration from the Eckim acquisition. The use of cash from the net change in working capital items included, most notably an increase in accounts receivable of $8.9 million due to an increase in billings for media campaigns as well as timing of payments, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.1 million primarily as a result of our prepayment of distribution fees, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities and accrued compensation and benefits of $2.3 million related to the timing of payments.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2016, net cash used in investing activities of $50.6 million, primarily reflects purchases of certificates of deposits of $88.2 million, purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of $6.4 million that includes technology hardware and software, and leasehold improvements to support our growth as well as capitalized development and enhancement costs related to Retailer iQ and Quotient Insights, partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of a certificate of deposit of $44.0 million. Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period-to-period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations, the addition of headcount and the development activities related to our future offerings including Quotient Insights. We expect to continue to invest in property and equipment and in the further development and enhancement of our software platform for the foreseeable future. In addition, from time to time, we may consider potential acquisitions that would complement our existing service offerings, enhance our technical capabilities or expand our marketing and sales presence. Any future transaction of this nature could require potentially significant amounts of capital or could require us to issue our stock and dilute existing stockholders.\nDuring 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $50.8 million, reflecting a $25.0 million purchase of a certificate of deposit investment, $16.8 million acquisition of Shopmium, $13.2 million in purchases of property and equipment, offset by proceeds of $4.8 million from the sale of a right to use a web domain name.\nDuring 2014, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment, including technology hardware and software to support our growth as well as capitalized internal-use software development costs and the net impact from our acquisitions, which included our Eckim acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nHistorically our financing activities have consisted primarily of net proceeds from the issuance of net borrowings under term debt and a line of credit, the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and repurchases of common stock. In March 2014, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 12,075,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $16.00 per share for which we received proceeds of $179.7 million which is net of underwriting discounts and commissions paid of $13.5 million, but before deducting estimated offering expenses of $5.4 million.\nDuring 2016, net cash used in financing activities was insignificant primarily due to repurchases of our common stock of $11.9 million, being offset by proceeds received from exercises of stock options of $12.0 million.\nDuring 2015, $24.6 million of net cash used in financing activities reflects $22.7 million in repurchases of our common stock and $7.5 million used to terminate and pay off the total debt outstanding on our line of credit, partially offset by $5.7 million of proceeds received from exercises of stock options.\nDuring 2014, cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of $176.5 million in proceeds from our IPO net of payments of offering costs of $3.2 million, proceeds from issuance of common stock of $10.6 million and exercise of a warrant of $1.6 million, partially offset by our repayment of debt obligations from a related party of $15.0 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our future minimum payments under contractual commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,581\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> We lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Mountain View, California and various sales offices, under operating lease agreements that expire through December 2024.

Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with internal-use software development costs, goodwill and intangible assets, net, impairment of long lived assets, revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in research and development expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the enhancements, generally three years.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIntangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that may indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nSuch assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured first by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, an impairment loss would be recognized for an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a one-time charge associated with certain distribution fees under an arrangement with a retailer partner that were deemed unrecoverable. When the Company delivers a digital coupon on a retailer's website or mobile app or through its loyalty program, or the website or mobile app of a publisher, or through its Retailer iQ platform, and the consumer takes certain actions, the Company pays a distribution fee to the retailer or other publisher, which, in some cases may be prepaid prior to being incurred. The Company considered various factors in its assessment including its historical experience with transaction volumes through the retailer and other comparative retailers, ongoing communications with the retailer to increase its marketing efforts to promote the digital platform, as well as the projected revenues, and associated revenue share payments. Accordingly, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a one-time charge of $7.4 million related to such distribution fees in cost of revenues on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a remaining non-refundable distribution fee prepayment balance of $0.2 million.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues primarily from the set-up and activation of coupons and coupons codes, and digital media services when all four of the following criteria are met:\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Delivery has occurred or a service has been provided;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Customer fees are fixed or determinable; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Collection is reasonably assured.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCoupons. We generate revenues, as consumers select, activate, or redeem a coupon through our platform by either printing it for physical redemption at a retailer or saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption. In the case of the setup fees, we recognize revenues proportionally, on a per activation basis, using the number of authorized activations per insertion order, commencing on the date of the first coupon activation. For coupons, the pricing is generally determined on a per unit activation basis. Setup fees charged to customers represent charges for the creation of digital coupons and related activation, tracking and security features. Insertion orders generally include a limit on the number of activations, or times consumers may select a coupon.\nCoupon Codes. We generally generate revenues when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform and completion of the order is reported to us. In the same period that we recognize revenues for the delivery of coupon codes, we also estimate and record a reserve, based upon historical experience, to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns which may not be reported until a subsequent date.\nDigital Media. Our media services enable CPGs and retailers to distribute digital media to promote their brands and products on our websites, and mobile apps, and through those of our affiliate publishers and non-publisher third parties. We charge a fee for these media campaigns, the pricing of which is based on the advertisement size and position. Related fees are generally billed monthly, based on per campaign, per impressions or a per click basis.\nWe do not offer rights of refund of previously paid or delivered amounts, rebates, rights of return or price protection. In all instances, we limit the amount of revenue recognized to the amounts for which we have the right to bill our customers.\nGross versus Net Revenue Reporting\nIn the normal course of business and through our distribution network, we deliver digital coupons and media on retailers' websites, through retailers' loyalty programs, and on the websites of digital publishers. In these situations, we generally pay a distribution fee to the retailers or digital publishers which is included in our cost of revenues. The determination of whether revenues should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on our assessment of whether we are the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether we are the principal or an agent, we follow the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. Because we are the primary obligor and are responsible for (i) fulfilling the digital coupon and media delivery, (ii) establishing the selling prices for delivery of the digital coupons and media, and (iii) performing all billing and collection activities including retaining credit risk, we have concluded that we are the principal in these arrangements, and therefore report revenues and cost of revenues on a gross basis.\nMultiple-element Arrangements\nFor arrangements with multiple-deliverables, we determine whether each of the individual deliverables qualify as a separate unit of accounting. In order to treat deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as a separate unit of accounting, the deliverable must have standalone value upon delivery.\nWe allocate the arrangement fee to all the deliverables (separate units of accounting) using the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d) if available, third-party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available and best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. VSOE and TPE do not currently exist for any of our deliverables. Accordingly, for arrangements with multiple deliverables that can be separated into different units of accounting, we allocate the arrangement fee to the separate units of accounting based on BESP. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors, including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, market conditions, competitive landscape and pricing practices. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation using the fair value method, which requires us to measure the stock-based compensation based on the grant-date fair value of the awards and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period. We recognize compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures. Equity awards issued to nonemployees are recorded at fair value on their measurement date and are subject to adjustment each period as the awards vest.\nThe fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs equals the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Our option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in past fiscal years, and our forecast of future taxable income in the jurisdictions.\nWe have placed a valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets and certain non-U.S. deferred tax assets, because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold.\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement.\nForeign Currency\nForeign currency denominated assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, and income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the period. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders' equity.\nPrior to the first quarter of 2016, the functional currency of each of the Company's international subsidiaries was the local currency, as its international subsidiaries negotiated and managed business locally with minimal involvement from the U.S. parent entity.\nBeginning the first quarter of 2016, the functional currency of certain international subsidiaries changed from its local currency to U.S. Dollar ( USD\u201d). The change in functional currency was the result of changes in the Company's international strategy primarily resulting from the acquisition of Shopmium S.A. (a private company based in France). The Company acquired Shopmium S.A. as part of its strategy to broaden international operations and subsequently, the Company reviewed its international strategy, including management of its relationships with international CPG brands, evaluation of worldwide competition and international pricing strategy, its plan to manage future billings and collections for international customers and plan to further develop the acquired technology for its subsequent use by various entities. Consequently, as part of the Company's new international strategy and changes to the way the Company runs its business internationally, it modified its existing international structure and entered into various inter-company licensing agreements between its U.S. entity and certain international entities. As these changes were significant, the Company considered the economic factors outlined in ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters, for the determination of the functional currency. The Company concluded that most of the factors pointed to the use of the parent's currency (USD) as the functional currency, which resulted in a change in functional currency to USD for such international subsidiaries.\nThe change in functional currency is applied on a prospective basis beginning with our first quarter of 2016 and translation adjustments for prior periods will continue to remain as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency transaction gains (losses) were immaterial for all the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09-Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14- Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 amended the existing accounting standards to achieve consistent application of revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Additionally, the standard requires reporting companies to also disclose the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In July 2015, the FASB agreed to delay the effective date of this amendment by one year, accordingly, the Company is required to adopt the amendments in the first quarter of 2018. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of the amendment, which is the first quarter of 2017. The Company is in the initial stages of its evaluation of the impact of the new standard on its accounting policies, processes, and system requirements. In addition to internal resources, the Company has engaged third party service providers to assist in the impact evaluation. Furthermore, the Company has made and will continue to make investments in systems to enable timely and accurate reporting under the new standard. The Company currently anticipates adopting the standard using the modified retrospective method and is evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02-Leases (Topic 842). The guidance requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today's accounting. Lessees initially recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease\nprepayments, lease incentives received and the lessee's initial direct costs. The standard is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within that reporting period, which is the first quarter of 2019 for the Company. Early adoption is permitted. ASU 2016-02 is required to be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09-Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The guidance requires all of the tax effects related to share based payments to be recorded through the income statement. The guidance also removes the present requirement to delay recognition of a windfall tax benefit until it reduces current taxes payable; instead it is recognized at the time of settlement, subject to normal valuation allowance consideration. While the simplification will eliminate some administrative complexities, it will increase the volatility of income tax expense. The standard is effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopting this update during the first quarter of 2017.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for public business entities for annual reporting years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period, which is the first quarter of 2018 for the Company. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report is the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for Quotient Technology Inc.

of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nQuotient Technology Inc., is a provider of an industry leading digital platform that enables consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands and retailers to engage shoppers through personalized and targeted promotions and media. Through our platform, CPGs and retailers are able to use online and in-store point-of-sale (POS) shopper data and analytics to drive sales with improved efficiency, as compared to traditional offline promotional and advertising vehicles.\nWe operate our platform across a broad distribution network, reaching over 40 million shoppers at the critical moments in their paths to purchase. Our network includes our website and mobile properties of our flagship consumer brand, Coupons.com, as well as our other owned and operated properties, and thousands of our publisher partners. In addition, we operate our platform, Retailer iQ, on a co-branded or white label basis with our retailer partners, providing them a digital platform to directly engage their shoppers across their websites, mobile, ecommerce, and social channels. Retailer iQ integrates with retailers' POS technology and leverages a broad set of shopper insights, including online behaviors, purchase, and purchase intent data to drive personalized and targeted promotions and media. Retailers using Retailer iQ are primarily in the grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise channels where the majority of CPG products are sold.\nOur network is made up of three constituencies: over 2,000 brands from approximately 700 CPGs; retailers across multiple classes of trade such as grocery, drug, dollar, club, and mass merchandise channels; and consumers visiting our web, mobile properties, social channels, as well as those of our CPGs and retailers.\nOur CPG customers include many of the leading food, beverage, drug, personal and household product manufacturers. We primarily generate revenue from CPGs by offering promotions and media content to consumers across our network. Our retailers include leading grocery, drug, dollar channel, club and mass merchandise retailers. We also service a broad range of specialty retailers, including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others, through which we generate revenue primarily from offering coupon codes through our platform.\nWe generate promotion revenues from digital transactions on our network. Each time a consumer activates a digital coupon on our platform we are generally paid a fee. Activation of a digital coupon can include: printing it for physical redemption at a retailer, saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption, or using a mobile device to scan a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase for automatic digital redemption and cash back. As our business evolves, we will continue to experiment with different pricing models and fee arrangements with CPGs and retailers which may impact how we monetize transactions. Promotion revenues includes revenues from coupon code offerings in which we are generally paid a fee when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform. We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers or publishers when a consumer activates a digital promotion on their website or mobile app. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics\u201d for more information.\nWe also generate media revenue through the placement of online advertisements from CPGs and retailers that are displayed on our websites and mobile apps, as well as those of our publishers, retailers and other third parties.\nOur operating expenses may increase in the future as we continue (1) to invest in (i) research and development to enhance our platform and investments in newer product offerings including Quotient Insights; (ii) sales and marketing to acquire new CPG and retailer customers and increase revenues from our existing customers; and, (iii) corporate infrastructure; (2) to incur additional general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting expenses, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (3) to amortize expenses related to intangibles assets associated with a services and data agreement and other strategic acquisitions.\nFor 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenues were $275.2 million, $237.3 million, and $221.8 million, respectively. Our net loss for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $19.5 million, $26.7 million, and $23.4 million, respectively.\nNon- GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics\nAdjusted Earnings Before Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, to develop short and long-term operational plans, and to determine bonus payouts. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial metric used by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, because such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and can vary significantly between periods. Additionally, it excludes the effects of interest, income taxes, gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name, other income (expense), net, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, and charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs.\nWe define a transaction\u201d as any action that generates revenue, directly or indirectly, including per item transaction fees, set up fees, volume-based fixed fees and revenue sharing. Transactions continue to exclude retailer offers that generate no direct revenue. Transactions indirectly generate revenue when the action is not paid for on a per item basis, but is part of an agreement which generates revenue for offer services; for example, transactions after a fixed fee cap has been reached would be included in our definition. This definition of transaction does not impact the number of transactions reported in prior filings. While the number of transactions on our platform has been an important indicator of our ability to grow our revenues, as our business continues to evolve and we experiment with different pricing models to monetize transactions, we believe transaction volume on our platform may become a less predictive indicator of future operating performance.\nNet loss, Adjusted EBITDA and number of transactions for each of the periods presented were as follows:\n\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA also does not include the effects of charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, interest, other income (expense), net, income taxes and gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name, and; \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods presented is as follows:\n\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with GAAP based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nObtaining high quality coupons and increasing the number of CPG-authorized activations. Our ability to grow revenue will depend upon our ability to continue to obtain high quality coupons and increase the number of CPG-authorized activations available through our platform. If we are unable to obtain high quality coupons and increase the number of CPG-authorized activations, we will not be able to increase the number of transactions and the growth in our revenue will be adversely affected.\nIncreasing revenue from CPGs on our platform. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future depends upon our ability to continue to increase revenues from existing CPGs on our platform. This includes increasing our share of CPG spending on overall coupons, media and trade promotions; increasing the number of brands that are using our platform within each CPG; increasing media spending on our platform; and increase our share of retailer spending on coupon codes. As transactions grow, volume discounts that we offer to our existing CPGs, may slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues on a per transaction basis.\nVariability in promotional spend by CPGs. Our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in promotional spending budgets of CPGs and retailers and the timing of their promotional spending. Decisions by major CPGs or retailers to delay or reduce their promotional and media spending, move campaigns, or divert spending away from digital promotions or media could slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues.\nAbility to scale Retailer iQ and further integrate with Retailers. Our ability to grow our revenues will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully implement and scale Retailer iQ among retailers. If we are unable to continue to successfully implement Retailer iQ, if the implementation or marketing of Retailer iQ is delayed or it is not adopted and supported with sufficient resources by retailers, the growth in our revenues will be adversely affected. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future is also dependent upon our ability to further integrate digital promotions and media into retailers' loyalty or point of sale systems and other channels so that CPGs and retailers can more effectively engage consumers and drive their own sales.\nGrowth of our consumer selection and digital offerings. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future will depend on our ability to innovate and invest in promotion and media solutions, including Retailer iQ, mobile solutions for consumers, including digital print, mobile solutions and digital promotion offerings for specialty/franchise retail, including coupon codes, leverage our reach to consumers and the strength of our platform to broaden the selection and use of coupon codes by consumers, manage the transition from digital print coupons to digital paperless coupons as well as the transition from desktop to mobile platforms, and invest in emerging solutions around our data and analytic capabilities, referred to as Quotient Insights, for CPGs and retailers.\nInternational Growth and Acquisitions. Our ability to grow our revenues will also depend on our ability to grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and expand our business through selective acquisitions, similar to our acquisition of Shopmium, and their integration with the core business of the company.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues by delivering digital coupons, including coupons and coupon codes, and digital media through our platform. CPGs and retailers choose one or more of our offerings and are charged a fee for each selected offering. Our customers generally submit insertion orders that outline the terms and conditions of a campaign, including the channels through which the campaign will be run, the offerings for each selected channel, the type of content to be delivered, the timeframe of the campaign, the number of authorized activations and the pricing of the campaign. Substantially all of our revenues are generated from sales in the United States.\nCoupons. We generate revenues, as consumers select, activate, or redeem a coupon through our platform by either printing it for physical redemption at a retailer or saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption. For setup fees, we recognize revenues proportionally, on a per activation basis, using the number of authorized activations per insertion order, commencing on the date of the first coupon activation. For coupons, the pricing is generally determined on a per unit activation basis. Setup fees charged to customers represent charges for the creation of digital coupons and related activation, tracking and security features. Insertion orders generally include a limit on the number of activations, or times consumers may select a coupon.\nCoupon Codes. We generally generate revenues when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform and completion of the order is reported to us. In the same period that we recognize revenues for the delivery of coupon codes, we also estimate and record a reserve, based upon historical experience, to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns which may not be reported until a subsequent date.\nDigital Media. Our media services enable CPGs and retailers to distribute digital media to promote their brands and products on our websites, and mobile apps, and through a network of our publishers and non-publisher third parties that display our media offerings on their websites or mobile apps. We charge a fee for these media campaigns, the pricing of which is based on the advertisement size and position. Related fees are generally billed monthly, based on a per-campaign, per-impressions or per-click basis.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes the costs resulting from distribution fees. If we deliver a digital coupon or media on a retailer's website or mobile apps or through its loyalty program, or the website or mobile apps of a publisher, we generally pay a distribution fee to the retailer or publisher which is included in our cost of revenues. These costs are expensed as incurred. We generally do not pay a distribution fee for a coupon or code which is offered through the website of the CPG or retailer that is offering the coupon or coupon code. From time to time, we have entered into arrangements pursuant to which we have agreed to the payment of minimum distribution or other service fees that are included in our cost of revenues. Distribution fees as a percent of total revenues were 23%, 16% and 15% during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCost of revenues also includes personnel costs, depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, software and acquired intangible assets incurred on revenue producing technologies, data center costs and third-party service fees. Personnel costs related to costs of revenues include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. These costs are primarily attributable to individuals maintaining our data centers and members of our network operations group, which initiates, sets up and delivers digital promotion and media campaigns. Cost of revenues also includes third-party data center costs. We capitalize costs related to software that is developed or obtained for internal use, including Retailer iQ and Quotient Insights. Costs incurred in connection with internal software development for revenue producing technologies are capitalized and are amortized in cost of revenues over the internal use software's useful life. The amortization of these costs begins when the internally developed software is ready for its intended use.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses primarily into three categories: sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, professional fees and facilities expense. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses generally include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including commissions), brand marketing, and, to a lesser extent, costs associated with professional services, travel, trade shows and marketing materials. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and continue to expand our marketing related programs designed to increase our revenues.\nResearch and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related headcount costs and costs of professional services associated with the ongoing development of our technology. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and employee benefit costs. Our developers reside in our Mountain View, California headquarters, Paris, France, which was acquired as part of our acquisition of Shopmium and our research and development center in Bangalore, India which we opened in January 2015. We anticipate growing employee headcount in India during 2017.\nWe believe that continued investment in technology is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. We also believe that continued operational and cost optimization efforts, is important, as it provides us with the ability to invest in strategic areas, while managing growth in future periods.\nGeneral and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and other corporate expenses. We expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses in future periods as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting costs, investor relations costs, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChange in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net. The change in fair value of escrowed shares relates to the acquisition of certain exclusivity rights under a services and data agreement whereby a certain amount of shares were issued and placed in escrow. Those shares are subject to re-measurement until released from escrow. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is the result of our re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of the assets of Eckim, in August 2014, and from the acquisition of Shopmium, in October 2015. The contingent consideration related to Eckim was determined based on an estimate of shares issuable to Eckim for achieving certain revenue and profit milestones at the end of the earnout period as of December 31, 2015. The inputs include the Company's stock price and the number of shares issuable. On January 26, 2016, the Company and the sellers of Eckim agreed on performance against the milestones and the shares to be issued. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the contingent liability of $1.9 million related to Eckim to stockholder's equity in the first quarter of 2016. The shares were issued during the second quarter of 2016.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense is primarily related to our debt obligations related to an outstanding credit agreement. All debt was repaid in the third quarter of 2015 and the credit agreement was terminated.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, includes interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a net increase in deferred tax liabilities associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and a decrease in foreign income taxed at non-US tax rates. The benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arose from a loss the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and net foreign tax benefit, partially offset by state income taxes. The provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities that arose from the gain the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations and our consolidated results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented.\n\nRevenues\n\n2016 Compared to 2015\nRevenues increased by $37.9 million, or 16%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of transactions on our platform during 2016 to 2.4 billion from 1.7 billion during 2015. Revenues generated from digital promotion transactions represented 94% of the 16% year over year increase, with the balance of the increase driven by our revenues from digital media campaigns. During 2016, revenues from digital promotion transactions and digital media were 77% and 23% of total revenues, respectively, as compared to 74% and 26% of total revenues, respectively, for 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues increased by $15.5 million, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of transactions on our platform during 2015 to 1.7 billion from 1.6 billion during 2014. Revenues generated from our digital media campaigns represented 54% of the 7% year over year increase, with the balance of the increase driven by our revenues from digital promotion transactions. During 2015, revenues from digital promotion transactions and digital media were 74% and 26% of total revenues, respectively, as compared to 76% and 24% of total revenues, respectively, for 2014.\nWe expect to see variability in our results quarter over quarter in the future as we continue to integrate our digital promotions and media solutions into retailers' in-store and point of sale systems and consumer channels, as well as digital print trends. We expect revenue growth in 2017 from deployments and continued adoption of Retailer iQ as well as ramping of volumes on", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this prospectus, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nQuotient Technology Inc., is a provider of an industry leading digital platform that enables consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands and retailers to engage shoppers through personalized and targeted promotions and media. Through our platform, CPGs and retailers are able to use online and in-store point-of-sale (POS) shopper data and analytics to drive sales with improved efficiency, as compared to traditional offline promotional and advertising vehicles.\nWe operate our platform across a broad distribution network, reaching over 40 million shoppers at the critical moments in their paths to purchase. Our network includes our website and mobile properties of our flagship consumer brand, Coupons.com, as well as our other owned and operated properties, and thousands of our publisher partners. In addition, we operate our platform, Retailer iQ, on a co-branded or white label basis with our retailer partners, providing them a digital platform to directly engage their shoppers across their websites, mobile, ecommerce, and social channels. Retailer iQ integrates with retailers' POS technology and leverages a broad set of shopper insights, including online behaviors, purchase, and purchase intent data to drive personalized and targeted promotions and media. Retailers using Retailer iQ are primarily in the grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise channels where the majority of CPG products are sold.\nOur network is made up of three constituencies: over 2,000 brands from approximately 700 CPGs; retailers across multiple classes of trade such as grocery, drug, dollar, club, and mass merchandise channels; and consumers visiting our web, mobile properties, social channels, as well as those of our CPGs and retailers.\nOur CPG customers include many of the leading food, beverage, drug, personal and household product manufacturers. We primarily generate revenue from CPGs by offering promotions and media content to consumers across our network. Our retailers include leading grocery, drug, dollar channel, club and mass merchandise retailers. We also service a broad range of specialty retailers, including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others, through which we generate revenue primarily from offering coupon codes through our platform.\nWe generate promotion revenues from digital transactions on our network. Each time a consumer activates a digital coupon on our platform we are generally paid a fee. Activation of a digital coupon can include: printing it for physical redemption at a retailer, saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption, or using a mobile device to scan a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase for automatic digital redemption and cash back. As our business evolves, we will continue to experiment with different pricing models and fee arrangements with CPGs and retailers which may impact how we monetize transactions. Promotion revenues includes revenues from coupon code offerings in which we are generally paid a fee when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform. We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers or publishers when a consumer activates a digital promotion on their website or mobile app. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics\u201d for more information.\nWe also generate media revenue through the placement of online advertisements from CPGs and retailers that are displayed on our websites and mobile apps, as well as those of our publishers, retailers and other third parties.\nOur operating expenses may increase in the future as we continue (1) to invest in (i) research and development to enhance our platform and investments in newer product offerings including Quotient Insights; (ii) sales and marketing to acquire new CPG and retailer customers and increase revenues from our existing customers; and, (iii) corporate infrastructure; (2) to incur additional general and administrative expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting expenses, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (3) to amortize expenses related to intangibles assets associated with a services and data agreement and other strategic acquisitions.\nFor 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenues were $275.2 million, $237.3 million, and $221.8 million, respectively. Our net loss for 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $19.5 million, $26.7 million, and $23.4 million, respectively.\nNon- GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics\nAdjusted Earnings Before Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), a non-GAAP financial measure, is a key metric used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, to develop short and long-term operational plans, and to determine bonus payouts. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is a key financial metric used by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash charges, such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, because such non-cash expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and can vary significantly between periods. Additionally, it excludes the effects of interest, income taxes, gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name, other income (expense), net, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, and charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs.\nWe define a transaction\u201d as any action that generates revenue, directly or indirectly, including per item transaction fees, set up fees, volume-based fixed fees and revenue sharing. Transactions continue to exclude retailer offers that generate no direct revenue. Transactions indirectly generate revenue when the action is not paid for on a per item basis, but is part of an agreement which generates revenue for offer services; for example, transactions after a fixed fee cap has been reached would be included in our definition. This definition of transaction does not impact the number of transactions reported in prior filings. While the number of transactions on our platform has been an important indicator of our ability to grow our revenues, as our business continues to evolve and we experiment with different pricing models to monetize transactions, we believe transaction volume on our platform may become a less predictive indicator of future operating performance.\nNet loss, Adjusted EBITDA and number of transactions for each of the periods presented were as follows:\nTable 204: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,479\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26,730\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,444\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,445,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,657,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,608,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA also does not include the effects of charges related to Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs, one-time charge for certain distribution fees, change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net, interest, other income (expense), net, income taxes and gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name, and; \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, for each of the periods presented is as follows:\nTable 211: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,479\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26,730\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (23,444\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, amortization and other (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,737\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-time charge for certain distribution fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,450\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (495\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (561\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale of a right to use a web domain name\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,800\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total adjustments\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Other includes Enterprise Resource Planning software implementation costs of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as substitute for, or as superior to, the corresponding financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because of these and other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with GAAP based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nObtaining high quality coupons and increasing the number of CPG-authorized activations. Our ability to grow revenue will depend upon our ability to continue to obtain high quality coupons and increase the number of CPG-authorized activations available through our platform. If we are unable to obtain high quality coupons and increase the number of CPG-authorized activations, we will not be able to increase the number of transactions and the growth in our revenue will be adversely affected.\nIncreasing revenue from CPGs on our platform. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future depends upon our ability to continue to increase revenues from existing CPGs on our platform. This includes increasing our share of CPG spending on overall coupons, media and trade promotions; increasing the number of brands that are using our platform within each CPG; increasing media spending on our platform; and increase our share of retailer spending on coupon codes. As transactions grow, volume discounts that we offer to our existing CPGs, may slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues on a per transaction basis.\nVariability in promotional spend by CPGs. Our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in promotional spending budgets of CPGs and retailers and the timing of their promotional spending. Decisions by major CPGs or retailers to delay or reduce their promotional and media spending, move campaigns, or divert spending away from digital promotions or media could slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues.\nAbility to scale Retailer iQ and further integrate with Retailers. Our ability to grow our revenues will depend upon our ability to continue to successfully implement and scale Retailer iQ among retailers. If we are unable to continue to successfully implement Retailer iQ, if the implementation or marketing of Retailer iQ is delayed or it is not adopted and supported with sufficient resources by retailers, the growth in our revenues will be adversely affected. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future is also dependent upon our ability to further integrate digital promotions and media into retailers' loyalty or point of sale systems and other channels so that CPGs and retailers can more effectively engage consumers and drive their own sales.\nGrowth of our consumer selection and digital offerings. Our ability to grow our revenue in the future will depend on our ability to innovate and invest in promotion and media solutions, including Retailer iQ, mobile solutions for consumers, including digital print, mobile solutions and digital promotion offerings for specialty/franchise retail, including coupon codes, leverage our reach to consumers and the strength of our platform to broaden the selection and use of coupon codes by consumers, manage the transition from digital print coupons to digital paperless coupons as well as the transition from desktop to mobile platforms, and invest in emerging solutions around our data and analytic capabilities, referred to as Quotient Insights, for CPGs and retailers.\nInternational Growth and Acquisitions. Our ability to grow our revenues will also depend on our ability to grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and expand our business through selective acquisitions, similar to our acquisition of Shopmium, and their integration with the core business of the company.\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues by delivering digital coupons, including coupons and coupon codes, and digital media through our platform. CPGs and retailers choose one or more of our offerings and are charged a fee for each selected offering. Our customers generally submit insertion orders that outline the terms and conditions of a campaign, including the channels through which the campaign will be run, the offerings for each selected channel, the type of content to be delivered, the timeframe of the campaign, the number of authorized activations and the pricing of the campaign. Substantially all of our revenues are generated from sales in the United States.\nCoupons. We generate revenues, as consumers select, activate, or redeem a coupon through our platform by either printing it for physical redemption at a retailer or saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption. For setup fees, we recognize revenues proportionally, on a per activation basis, using the number of authorized activations per insertion order, commencing on the date of the first coupon activation. For coupons, the pricing is generally determined on a per unit activation basis. Setup fees charged to customers represent charges for the creation of digital coupons and related activation, tracking and security features. Insertion orders generally include a limit on the number of activations, or times consumers may select a coupon.\nCoupon Codes. We generally generate revenues when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform and completion of the order is reported to us. In the same period that we recognize revenues for the delivery of coupon codes, we also estimate and record a reserve, based upon historical experience, to provide for end-user cancelations or product returns which may not be reported until a subsequent date.\nDigital Media. Our media services enable CPGs and retailers to distribute digital media to promote their brands and products on our websites, and mobile apps, and through a network of our publishers and non-publisher third parties that display our media offerings on their websites or mobile apps. We charge a fee for these media campaigns, the pricing of which is based on the advertisement size and position. Related fees are generally billed monthly, based on a per-campaign, per-impressions or per-click basis.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues includes the costs resulting from distribution fees. If we deliver a digital coupon or media on a retailer's website or mobile apps or through its loyalty program, or the website or mobile apps of a publisher, we generally pay a distribution fee to the retailer or publisher which is included in our cost of revenues. These costs are expensed as incurred. We generally do not pay a distribution fee for a coupon or code which is offered through the website of the CPG or retailer that is offering the coupon or coupon code. From time to time, we have entered into arrangements pursuant to which we have agreed to the payment of minimum distribution or other service fees that are included in our cost of revenues. Distribution fees as a percent of total revenues were 23%, 16% and 15% during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nCost of revenues also includes personnel costs, depreciation and amortization expense of equipment, software and acquired intangible assets incurred on revenue producing technologies, data center costs and third-party service fees. Personnel costs related to costs of revenues include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits. These costs are primarily attributable to individuals maintaining our data centers and members of our network operations group, which initiates, sets up and delivers digital promotion and media campaigns. Cost of revenues also includes third-party data center costs. We capitalize costs related to software that is developed or obtained for internal use, including Retailer iQ and Quotient Insights. Costs incurred in connection with internal software development for revenue producing technologies are capitalized and are amortized in cost of revenues over the internal use software's useful life. The amortization of these costs begins when the internally developed software is ready for its intended use.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses primarily into three categories: sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative. Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and, to a lesser extent, professional fees and facilities expense. Personnel costs for each category of operating expenses generally include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation and employee benefits.\nSales and marketing. Our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs (including commissions), brand marketing, and, to a lesser extent, costs associated with professional services, travel, trade shows and marketing materials. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and continue to expand our marketing related programs designed to increase our revenues.\nResearch and development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related headcount costs and costs of professional services associated with the ongoing development of our technology. Personnel costs include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and employee benefit costs. Our developers reside in our Mountain View, California headquarters, Paris, France, which was acquired as part of our acquisition of Shopmium and our research and development center in Bangalore, India which we opened in January 2015. We anticipate growing employee headcount in India during 2017.\nWe believe that continued investment in technology is critical to attaining our strategic objectives. We also believe that continued operational and cost optimization efforts, is important, as it provides us with the ability to invest in strategic areas, while managing growth in future periods.\nGeneral and administrative. Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs associated with our executive, finance, legal, human resources, compliance and other administrative personnel, as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and other corporate expenses. We expect to continue to incur additional general and administrative expenses in future periods as we continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company, including increased legal and accounting costs, investor relations costs, higher insurance premiums and compliance costs associated with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChange in fair value of escrowed shares and contingent consideration, net. The change in fair value of escrowed shares relates to the acquisition of certain exclusivity rights under a services and data agreement whereby a certain amount of shares were issued and placed in escrow. Those shares are subject to re-measurement until released from escrow. The change in fair value of contingent consideration is the result of our re-measurement of the contingent consideration liability from the acquisition of the assets of Eckim, in August 2014, and from the acquisition of Shopmium, in October 2015. The contingent consideration related to Eckim was determined based on an estimate of shares issuable to Eckim for achieving certain revenue and profit milestones at the end of the earnout period as of December 31, 2015. The inputs include the Company's stock price and the number of shares issuable. On January 26, 2016, the Company and the sellers of Eckim agreed on performance against the milestones and the shares to be issued. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the contingent liability of $1.9 million related to Eckim to stockholder's equity in the first quarter of 2016. The shares were issued during the second quarter of 2016.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense is primarily related to our debt obligations related to an outstanding credit agreement. All debt was repaid in the third quarter of 2015 and the credit agreement was terminated.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, includes interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The provision for income taxes of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to a net increase in deferred tax liabilities associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and a decrease in foreign income taxed at non-US tax rates. The benefit from income taxes of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities that arose from a loss the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions and net foreign tax benefit, partially offset by state income taxes. The provision for income taxes of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities that arose from the gain the Company recorded from a change in the fair value of contingent consideration from prior year acquisitions.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our consolidated results of operations and our

2015\nRevenues increased by $37.9 million, or 16%, during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of transactions on our platform during 2016 to 2.4 billion from 1.7 billion during 2015. Revenues generated from digital promotion transactions represented 94% of the 16% year over year increase, with the balance of the increase driven by our revenues from digital media campaigns. During 2016, revenues from digital promotion transactions and digital media were 77% and 23% of total revenues, respectively, as compared to 74% and 26% of total revenues, respectively, for 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nRevenues increased by $15.5 million, or 7%, during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the same period in 2014.
