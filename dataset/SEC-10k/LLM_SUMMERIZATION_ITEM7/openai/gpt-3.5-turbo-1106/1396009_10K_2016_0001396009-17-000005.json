SALES AND MARKETING EXCELLENCE\nGoal: Remain the market supplier of choice in order to increase our market share while earning full and fair value for our products and services.\nExecution: We are winning more than our fair share of large project bids by leveraging our scale and extensive strong customer relationships.\n2. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nGoal: Run the industry's safest and most efficient operations by successfully leveraging and driving cost efficiencies to achieve 60% flow through of incremental aggregates freight-adjusted revenues.\nExecution: We are driving our cost of revenues down by leveraging our purchasing power and multi-modal logistics network and by better managing inventory levels. In 2016 and 2015, we exceeded our long-term flow through goal of 60% by achieving 65% and 67%, respectively, flow through of incremental aggregates freight-adjusted revenues.\n3. SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL (SAG) PRODUCTIVITY\nGoal: Continue to leverage SAG in order to achieve 6% of total revenues.\nExecution: We are leveraging our recently implemented common ERP platform and reorganized central shared services to reduce administrative expenses and enable rapid integration of acquired operations. As a result, SAG as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 9.1% in 2014 to 8.8% in 2016.\n4. CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY\nGoal: Drive improvement in capital turnover while maintaining the longer term health of our asset base.\nExecution: We are improving capital turnover by maximizing the lifecycle value of land holdings and optimizing working capital and inventory levels.\n5. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\nGoal: Continue to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions and selectively enter new markets that meet our growth profile while divesting non-core businesses.\nExecution: In 2016, we expanded our aggregates distribution capabilities in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas. In 2015, we completed a swap of twelve ready-mixed concrete plants in California for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. We also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete plants in Arizona and New Mexico.\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOUR COMMITMENTS\nWe crush rocks for a living, but at its core, this is a relationship business. We are deeply committed to our customers and our people, and deeply embedded in our communities.\nOur commitment to customers - We have the capabilities to fulfill our customers' needs on large, complex jobs with unmatched performance and service and we aim to be the supplier of choice for smaller contractors. With all of our customers, we strive to maintain and improve our relationships, to provide outstanding value and service for a fair price by being a solution provider rather than simply an aggregates provider.\nOur commitment to our employees - We work hard to ensure our employees' safety and health, in a positive environment where each person can thrive. We are completely focused on the things that we can control, and it is here that our people continue to make all the difference: increasing unit profitability, delivering incremental earnings and improving our world-class aggregates franchise every day.\nOur commitment to our communities - Our people contribute to the cities, towns and neighborhoods where they live and work, in big ways and in small; from disaster relief to the support of education and a wide variety of other social causes and programs. At Vulcan, this means a great deal more than just financial support. Our people throughout the United States, and in Mexico, are generously volunteering their time, talent and energy to improve the world around them.\nOur commitment to the environment - We take a long-term approach that bears in mind the demands of the present and the needs of the future. As we continue to build on our legacy, we do so with a clear view of our responsibility to future generations.\nOur commitment to our shareholders - We work hard every day to generate returns that exceed market averages. We are good stewards, with responsible operating and capital project expenditures, to achieve a healthy return on our shareholders' investment in us. We will continue to strive to be the market leader, winning on margin performance, consistent strength of execution and pricing performance; earning a superior return on the very significant capital invested in our business.\nWe believe our ability to succeed stems directly from these commitments. Over the years, nearly six decades, we have built a strong, resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way. We expect this to continue for the decades to come.\n2016 ACQUISITIONS\nDuring 2016, we acquired the assets of the following businesses for total consideration of $33.3 million:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nan asphalt plant in New Mexico\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nan aggregates facility in Texas\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\na distribution business in Georgia to complement our aggregates logistics and distribution activities\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK\nThe strong fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business and the outstanding improvement in our core profitability have led to strong earnings growth during the last three years of recovery. In 2017, we expect continued growth across the vast majority of our markets and across each of the end use segments we serve. Our expectation for full year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 to $1.225 billion is driven by a continuing recovery in shipments, with higher levels of publicly funded construction activity just beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand, as well as a favorable pricing environment.\nThe following assumptions support our outlook for strong year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA in 2017:\nTable 162: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAggregates shipments growth of 5% to 8% from 2016, with growth weighted more toward the second half of the year\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFreight-adjusted aggregates price increase of 5% to 7%, with unit margins continuing to grow faster than pricing\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAsphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium segment gross profit growth of approximately 15%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSAG expenses of approximately $320 million, 2% higher than the prior year and excluding business development-related expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expectations include:\nTable 166: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCore capital spending of approximately $300 million to support the increased level of shipments and further improve production costs and operating efficiencies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 167: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nInterest expense of approximately $140 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDepreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense of approximately $300 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEffective tax rate of 28%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe remain focused on continuous, compounding improvement in profitability and cash flows. Our 2017 outlook reflects earnings growth and unit margin performance consistent with recent trends as well as our longer range goals. The flow-through of freight-adjusted revenues to gross profit in our Aggregates segment should remain in line with the long-term goal of greater than 60%. Since the beginning of this recovery, our efforts have resulted in Aggregates segment gross profit increasing $515 million on a 41 million ton increase in shipments. During this same period, unit gross profit in our core Aggregates segment has improved 89% on a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n*Excludes more recent acquisitions.\nTTM 2Q'13 represents the cyclical low in aggregates volumes.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. Likewise, we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent pass-through activities.

When discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods, we may exclude the operating results of recently acquired/divested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed. These recently acquired/divested businesses are disclosed in Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis. We believe that measuring performance on a same-store basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity. Our same-store information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities.\n\ufeff\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAggregates segment gross profit margin as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues is not a GAAP measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes freight, delivery and transportation revenues, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in freight-adjusted revenues.

Cash paid for this debt purchase is presented as a component of financing activities. Additionally, upon our 2016 early adoption of ASU 2016-09 (see Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d under the caption Share-based Compensation), gross excess tax benefits for 2016 of $28.0 million are classified as operating cash flows.

Cash received associated with gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities.

We invested $350.1 million in our existing operations in 2016, a $60.9 million increase compared to 2015. Of this $350.1 million, $99.2 million was invested in shipping capacity replacement, new site developments and other growth opportunities. During 2016, we expanded our aggregates distribution capabilities in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas for $32.5 million of cash consideration. Conversely, acquisitions during 2015 totaled $27.2 million in cash consideration (see Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d).\n2015 versus 2014 - Net cash used for investing activities was $309.7 million during 2015, a $548.0 million decrease in cash compared to the $238.3 million of net cash provided during 2014. This decrease was the result of lower proceeds from the sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, less cash used in acquisitions and higher capital investments in our existing operations. During 2014, we sold: a previously mined and subsequently reclaimed tract of land for $10.7 million, land previously containing a sales yard for $5.8 million, and our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area for $721.4 million. We had no comparable significant sales in 2015. During 2014, we completed several acquisitions for cash consideration of $284.2 million. Conversely, acquisitions during 2015 totaled $27.2 million in cash consideration (see Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d).

Additionally, there were no proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in 2016 (compared to $73.0 million in 2015) as only stock-only stock appreciation rights (SOSARs) remained outstanding at the beginning of the year. Finally, the aforementioned early adoption of ASU 2016-09 resulted in 2016 gross excess tax benefits of $28.0 million classified as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows.\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n2015 VERSUS 2014 - Net cash used for financing activities in 2015 was $67.0 million, a decrease of $484.8 million from 2014. This large decrease is primarily attributable to 2014's $506.4 million principal amount debt purchase, which required $579.7 million of cash. The 2014 debt purchase was funded by the aforementioned sale of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area. In 2015, we refinanced $635.1 million principal amount of debt and entered into a new $750.0 million line of credit. The total cash requirement for these actions was $702.3 million ($635.1 million principal, $59.3 million of premiums above par and transaction fees of $7.9 million). We funded the refinancing by issuing $400.0 million of new 10-year notes, borrowing $235.0 million under our new and expanded line of credit and using $67.3 million of cash. Furthermore, in 2014 we generated $30.6 million of cash by issuing new shares to our 401(k) plan (such issuances were discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2014). Finally, in 2015 we returned capital to our investors by repurchasing 228 thousand shares of common stock for cash consideration of $21.5 million.\nDEBT\nCertain debt measures as of December 31 are outlined below:\n\ufeff\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\ndollars in millions\n</td> <td>2016 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>2015 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n$ 0.1\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 0.1\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nShort-term debt (line of credit)\n</td> <td>0.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>0.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-term debt 1\n</td> <td>1,982.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1,980.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal debt\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,982.9\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,980.4\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCapital\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal debt\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,982.9\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,980.4\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEquity\n</td> <td>4,572.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>4,454.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal capital\n</td> <td>\n$ 6,555.4\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n$ 6,434.6\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Debt as a Percentage of Total Capital\n</td> <td>30.2% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>30.8% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWeighted-average Effective Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLine of credit 2\n</td> <td>1.25% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>1.75% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTerm debt\n</td> <td>7.52% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>7.52% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFixed versus Floating Interest Rate Debt\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFixed-rate debt\n</td> <td>88.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>88.3% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFloating-rate debt\n</td> <td>11.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>11.7% \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n\ufeff\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes borrowing under our line of credit for which we have the intent and ability to extend repayment beyond twelve months, as follows: December 31, 2016 - $235.0 million and December 31, 2015 - $235.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReflects the margin above LIBOR for LIBOR-based borrowings; we also paid upfront fees that are amortized to interest expense and pay fees for unused borrowing capacity and standby letters of credit.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLINE OF CREDIT\nIn December 2016, among other favorable changes, we extended the maturity date of our unsecured $750.0 million line of credit from June 2020 to December 2021 (incurring $1.9 million of transaction fees together with the new term loan described below).\nThe credit agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for an unsecured investment-grade facility (none of which materially impact our ability to execute our strategic, operating and financial plans). The financial covenants are: (1) a maximum ratio of debt to EBITDA of 3.5:1 (upon certain acquisitions, the maximum ratio can be 3.75:1 for three quarters), and (2) a minimum ratio of EBITDA to net cash interest expense of 3.0:1. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the line of credit covenants.\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nBorrowings and other cost ranges and details are described in Note 6 Debt\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d As of December 31, 2016, the credit margin for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) borrowings was 1.25%, the credit margin for base rate borrowings was 0.25%, and the commitment fee for the unused portion was 0.15%.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our available borrowing capacity under the line of credit was $475.5 million. Utilization of the borrowing capacity was as follows:\nTable 266: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$235.0 million was borrowed\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$39.5 million was used to provide support for outstanding standby letters of credit\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTERM DEBT\nAll of our term debt is unsecured. $1,769.0 million of such debt is governed by two essentially identical indentures that contain customary investment-grade type covenants. The primary covenant in both indentures limits the amount of secured debt we may incur without ratably securing such debt. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the term debt covenants.\nIn December 2016, we entered into an unsecured $250.0 million delayed draw term loan (incurring, together with the line of credit extension mentioned previously, $1.9 million of transaction costs). The term loan is provided by the same group of banks that provides our line of credit, and is governed by the same credit agreement as the line of credit. As such, it is subject to the same affirmative, negative, and financial covenants.\nThe term loan may be funded in up to three draws through June 21, 2017, after which any undrawn amount expires. Borrowings bear interest in the same manner as the line of credit. Until June 21, 2017, we also pay a commitment fee on the undrawn amount in the same manner as the line of credit. The term loan principal will be repaid quarterly beginning March 2018 (quarter 5 after closing) as follows: quarters 5 - 8 @ 0.625%; quarters 9 - 12 @ 1.25%; quarters 13 - 19 @ 1.875% and quarter 20 @ 79.375%. The term loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty.\nIn March, April and August of 2015, we completed the refinancing of $485.1 million principal amount of debt as described in Note 6 Debt\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d And, in December 2015 we refinanced at maturity the $150.0 million of 10.125% notes via borrowing on our line of credit. These refinancing actions resulted in total debt of approximately $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2015 (consistent with year-end 2014) and have the following benefits, among others: (1) eliminated $621.1 million of debt maturities in 2015 - 2018, (2) extended the weighted-average life of our debt portfolio, and (3) lowered our weighted-average interest rate.\nThe 2015 refinancing actions resulted in charges totaling $67.1 million. Such charges are detailed in Note 6 Debt\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and are presented in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a component of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDEBT PAYMENTS AND MATURITIES\nThere were no significant scheduled debt payments during 2016. Scheduled debt payments during 2015 included $150.0 million in December to retire the 10.125% notes (which were refinanced via long-term borrowings on our line of credit). Additionally, we refinanced $485.1 million of debt in 2015 as described in Note 6 Debt\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2016, current maturities

A summary of these policies is included in Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nWe prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following six critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 282: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGoodwill impairment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n2.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nImpairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n3.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPension and other postretirement benefits\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n4.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEnvironmental compliance costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n5.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nClaims and litigation including self-insurance\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n6.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncome taxes\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n1. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2016, goodwill represents 37% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment.\nHOW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, one level below our operating segments. We have identified 18 reporting units, of which 9 carry goodwill. We have the option of either assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units exceeds their respective fair value or proceeding directly to a two-step quantitative test. We elected to perform the quantitative impairment test for all years presented.\nSTEP 1\nWe compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill:\nTable 288: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nif the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nif the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSTEP 2\nWe compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill:\nTable 290: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nif the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nHOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE\nFirst, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting units using both an income approach (which involves discounting estimated future cash flows) and a market approach (which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies). We consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. Finally, to assess the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we compare the total of the reporting unit fair values to our market capitalization.\nOUR FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS\nWe base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and actual results may differ. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.\nThe significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.\nRESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS\nThe results of our annual impairment tests for:\nTable 292: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNovember 1, 2016 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (in excess of 100%) their carrying values\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNovember 1, 2015 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (in excess of 100%) their carrying values\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nNovember 1, 2014 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded (in excess of 20%) their carrying values\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information about goodwill, see Note 18 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n2. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL\nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2016, net property, plant & equipment represents 39% of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents 9% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgment. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nFair value is estimated primarily by using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable judgment and assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.\nTable 295: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe test long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g., asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates) impacts the profitability of the downstream business.\nDuring 2016, we recorded a $10.5 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets resulting from the termination of a nonstrategic aggregates lease and the write off of nonrecoverable project costs related to two Aggregates segment capital projects that we no longer intend to complete. During 2015, we recorded a $5.2 million impairment loss resulting from exiting a lease. During 2014, we recorded a $3.1 million impairment loss related primarily to assets retained in the divestiture of our cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area, see Note 19 \"Acquisitions and Divestitures\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nWe maintain certain long-lived assets that are not currently being used in our operations. These assets totaled $374.4 million at December 31, 2016, representing a less than 1.0% increase from December 31, 2015. Of the total $374.4 million, approximately 40% relates to real estate held for future development and expansion of our operations. In addition, approximately 25% is comprised of real estate (principally former mining sites) pending development as commercial or residential real estate, reservoirs or landfills. The remaining 35% is composed of aggregates, asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete operating assets idled temporarily as a result of a decline in demand for our products. We anticipate moving idled assets back into operation as demand recovers. We evaluate the useful lives and the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nFor additional information about long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 \"Property, Plant & Equipment\" and Note 18 \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n3. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nAccounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions about the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each year we review the following primary assumptions:\nTable 296: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDISCOUNT RATES - The discount rate used in calculating the present value of projected benefit payments and the discount rates used to measure service cost and interest cost\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 297: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS - The expected future return on plan assets reduces the recorded net benefit costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 298: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE - Annual pay increases after 2015 will not increase our pension plan obligations as a result of a 2013 plan amendment\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 299: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS - Future increases in the per capita cost after 2015 will not increase our postretirement medical benefits obligation as a result of a 2012 plan amendment to cap medical coverage cost at the 2015 level\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHOW WE SET OUR ASSUMPTIONS\nIn selecting the discount rate, we use the yield on high-quality bonds with a duration equal to the duration of plan liabilities. At December 31, 2016, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 3.43% to 4.41% (December 31, 2015 ranged from 3.53% to 4.68%).\nIn estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2016, the expected return on plan assets was reduced to 7.00% (December 31, 2015 was 7.50%).\nTable 300: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nChanges to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations and the annual net benefit cost.

No contributions were made to the qualified pension plans in 2016.\nDuring 2017, we expect to recognize net pension expense of approximately $0.4 million and net postretirement credit of approximately $(3.7) million compared to credits of $(3.6) million and $(3.7) million, respectively, in 2016. The increases are primarily due to a reduction in discount rates coupled with the aforementioned reduction in the expected long-term return on pension assets.\nIn 2016, we changed our method to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Previously, we estimated the service and interest cost components using a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. As of 2016, we elected to use a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost, applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. We made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding yield curve spot rates.\nWe accounted for this change as a change in estimate and, accordingly, accounted for it prospectively as of 2016. The weighted-average discount rates used to measure service and interest costs for 2016 were 4.68% and 3.79%, respectively, for our pension plans and 3.77% and 2.81%, respectively, for our other postretirement plans.\nWe do not anticipate contributions to the funded pension plans will be required during 2017; however, we do anticipate making a discretionary contribution of $9.5 million. We currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.\nFor additional information about pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 \"Benefit Plans\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n4. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS\nOur environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs. Our accounting policy for environmental compliance costs is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.\nHOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS\nTo account for environmental costs, we:\nTable 303: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nexpense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\naccrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur, but generally liabilities are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. If no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2016, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $3.3 million - this amount does not represent our maximum exposure to loss for all environmental remediation obligations as it excludes those sites for which a range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Our environmental remediation obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis.\nAccrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates and key assumptions in response to new information, such as the kinds and quantities of hazardous substances, available technologies and changes to the parties participating in the remediation efforts. However, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.\nFor additional information about environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 \"Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n5. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE\nWe are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers' compensation up to $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $3.0 million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.\nUnder our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.\nOur accounting policy for claims and litigation including self-insurance is a critical accounting policy because it involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and requires considerable management judgment.\nHOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS\nWe use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.\nFor additional information about claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n6. INCOME TAXES\nVALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nWe file federal, state and foreign income tax returns and account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities (which reflect our best assessment of the future taxes we will pay) based on the differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns while deferred tax liabilities represent items that will result in additional tax in future tax returns.\nSignificant judgments and estimates are required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates are updated throughout the year to consider income tax return filings, our geographic mix of earnings, legislative changes and other relevant items.\nEach quarter we analyze the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in either the carryback or carryforward period. A valuation allowance is recorded if, based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. A summary of our deferred tax assets is included in Note 9 Income Taxes\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nAt December 31, 2016, we have state net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets of $54.5 million, against which we have a valuation allowance of $44.2 million. Of the deferred tax assets, $53.2 million relates to Alabama.\nFrom 2008 through the second quarter of 2015, we carried a full valuation allowance against the Alabama deferred tax asset for the following reasons:\nTable 307: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nwe had a substantial cumulative loss in Alabama\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00a7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\ndue to our legal entity structure, we had no expectation of creating sufficient taxable income in Alabama\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we restructured our legal entities. Among other benefits, we anticipated that the restructuring would generate significant taxable income in Alabama, and therefore, allow for the utilization of some or all of the Alabama deferred tax asset.\nOur Alabama cumulative loss is calculated as pretax earnings from continuing operations, discontinued operations and other comprehensive income plus permanent differences over the last three years. While evaluating all available positive and negative evidence, realizing the significance of the restructuring in our Alabama income tax filing, we determined that it was appropriate to adjust our Alabama cumulative loss calculation to consider the restructuring, remove pretax earnings from discontinued operations and other comprehensive income and remove any other significant nonrecurring items. We refer to this calculation as our Alabama adjusted earnings.\nAt the end of the second quarter of 2015, our Alabama adjusted earnings were negative. However, the Alabama adjusted earnings loss was dramatically smaller than our Alabama cumulative loss (of the three adjustments made, the restructuring had the greatest impact). In addition, we considered all other forms of positive and negative evidence, including the four sources of taxable income. The first three sources of taxable income (carryback potential, reversing temporary differences and tax planning strategies) provided very little positive evidence. Because our Alabama adjusted earnings were a loss, we did not project future Alabama taxable income (the fourth source). As a result, during the second quarter of 2015 we continued to carry a full valuation allowance against our Alabama deferred tax asset.\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2015, our Alabama adjusted earnings turned positive. This development provided sufficient positive evidence such that we determined it was appropriate to use projections of future Alabama taxable income in our assessment for the first time. However, because we had not yet returned to sustained profitability (i.e., an Alabama cumulative gain) we used our Alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings as the basis for an objectively verifiable projection of future Alabama taxable income. This projection, in addition to considering all other positive and negative evidence, led us to conclude in the third quarter that it was more likely than not that $4.7 million of the deferred tax asset was realizable. Therefore, we recognized a deferred tax benefit of $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2015 by reducing the valuation allowance. Our analysis in each of the four subsequent quarters further confirmed our third quarter of 2015 conclusion but resulted in no further reductions of the valuation allowance.\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPart II\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, we achieved three consecutive years of positive Alabama adjusted earnings. This development together with the projection of future Alabama taxable income (using our most recent trailing twelve months adjusted earnings) warranted an additional partial release of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As of year-end 2016, we have recognized $9.5 million of the Alabama deferred tax asset.\nWe believe that once we have an Alabama cumulative gain, we will have sufficient positive evidence to conclude that we have returned to sustained profitability and we will no longer limit our estimate of future taxable income to our Alabama trailing twelve months adjusted earnings. At that time, we may realize a significant portion, if not all, of the Alabama deferred tax asset. We project the earliest this could happen would be the fourth quarter of 2017.\nLIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS\nWe recognize a tax benefit associated with a tax position when we judge it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based upon the technical merits of the position. For a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, we measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. A liability is established for the unrecognized portion of any tax position. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation.\nThe years open to tax examinations vary by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is appropriate.\nWe consider a tax position to be resolved at the earlier of the issue being effectively settled,\u201d settlement of an examination, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. Upon resolution of a tax position, any liability for unrecognized tax benefits will be released.\nOur liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties associated with our liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted and pending adoption and the effect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see Note 1 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" under the caption New Accounting Standards.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby.

SALES AND MARKETING EXCELLENCE\nGoal: Remain the market supplier of choice in order to increase our market share while earning full and fair value for our products and services.\nExecution: We are winning more than our fair share of large project bids by leveraging our scale and extensive strong customer relationships.\n2. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nGoal: Run the industry's safest and most efficient operations by successfully leveraging and driving cost efficiencies to achieve 60% flow through of incremental aggregates freight-adjusted revenues.\nExecution: We are driving our cost of revenues down by leveraging our purchasing power and multi-modal logistics network and by better managing inventory levels. In 2016 and 2015, we exceeded our long-term flow through goal of 60% by achieving 65% and 67%, respectively, flow through of incremental aggregates freight-adjusted revenues.\n3. SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL (SAG) PRODUCTIVITY\nGoal: Continue to leverage SAG in order to achieve 6% of total revenues.\nExecution: We are leveraging our recently implemented common ERP platform and reorganized central shared services to reduce administrative expenses and enable rapid integration of acquired operations. As a result, SAG as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 9.1% in 2014 to 8.8% in 2016.\n4. CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY\nGoal: Drive improvement in capital turnover while maintaining the longer term health of our asset base.\nExecution: We are improving capital turnover by maximizing the lifecycle value of land holdings and optimizing working capital and inventory levels.\n5. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\nGoal: Continue to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions and selectively enter new markets that meet our growth profile while divesting non-core businesses.\nExecution: In 2016, we expanded our aggregates distribution capabilities in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas. In 2015, we completed a swap of twelve ready-mixed concrete plants in California for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. We also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete plants in Arizona and New Mexico.\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOUR COMMITMENTS\nWe crush rocks for a living, but at its core, this is a relationship business. We are deeply committed to our customers and our people, and deeply embedded in our communities.\nOur commitment to customers - We have the capabilities to fulfill our customers' needs on large, complex jobs with unmatched performance and service and we aim to be the supplier of choice for smaller contractors. With all of our customers, we strive to maintain and improve our relationships, to provide outstanding value and service for a fair price by being a solution provider rather than simply an aggregates provider.\nOur commitment to our employees - We work hard to ensure our employees' safety and health, in a positive environment where each person can thrive. We are completely focused on the things that we can control, and it is here that our people continue to make all the difference: increasing unit profitability, delivering incremental earnings and improving our world-class aggregates franchise every day.\nOur commitment to our communities - Our people contribute to the cities, towns and neighborhoods where they live and work, in big ways and in small; from disaster relief to the support of education and a wide variety of other social causes and programs. At Vulcan, this means a great deal more than just financial support. Our people throughout the United States, and in Mexico, are generously volunteering their time, talent and energy to improve the world around them.\nOur commitment to the environment - We take a long-term approach that bears in mind the demands of the present and the needs of the future. As we continue to build on our legacy, we do so with a clear view of our responsibility to future generations.\nOur commitment to our shareholders - We work hard every day to generate returns that exceed market averages. We are good stewards, with responsible operating and capital project expenditures, to achieve a healthy return on our shareholders' investment in us. We will continue to strive to be the market leader, winning on margin performance, consistent strength of execution and pricing performance; earning a superior return on the very significant capital invested in our business.\nWe believe our ability to succeed stems directly from these commitments. Over the years, nearly six decades, we have built a strong, resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way. We expect this to continue for the decades to come.\n2016 ACQUISITIONS\nDuring 2016, we acquired the assets of the following businesses for total consideration of $33.3 million:\n \u00a7 an asphalt plant in New Mexico \n \u00a7 an aggregates facility in Texas \n \u00a7 a distribution business in Georgia to complement our aggregates logistics and distribution activities \nFor a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK\nThe strong fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business and the outstanding improvement in our core profitability have led to strong earnings growth during the last three years of recovery. In 2017, we expect continued growth across the vast majority of our markets and across each of the end use segments we serve. Our expectation for full year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 to $1.225 billion is driven by a continuing recovery in shipments, with higher levels of publicly funded construction activity just beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand, as well as a favorable pricing environment.\nThe following assumptions support our outlook for strong year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA in 2017:\n \u00a7 Aggregates shipments growth of 5% to 8% from 2016, with growth weighted more toward the second half of the year \n \u00a7 Freight-adjusted aggregates price increase of 5% to 7%, with unit margins continuing to grow faster than pricing \n \u00a7 Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium segment gross profit growth of approximately 15% \n \u00a7 SAG expenses of approximately $320 million, 2% higher than the prior year and excluding business development-related expenses \nOther expectations include:\n \u00a7 Core capital spending of approximately $300 million to support the increased level of shipments and further improve production costs and operating efficiencies \n \u00a7 Interest expense of approximately $140 million \n \u00a7 Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense of approximately $300 million \n \u00a7 Effective tax rate of 28% \nWe remain focused on continuous, compounding improvement in profitability and cash flows. Our 2017 outlook reflects earnings growth and unit margin performance consistent with recent trends as well as our longer range goals. The flow-through of freight-adjusted revenues to gross profit in our Aggregates segment should remain in line with the long-term goal of greater than 60%. Since the beginning of this recovery, our efforts have resulted in Aggregates segment gross profit increasing $515 million on a 41 million ton increase in shipments. During this same period, unit gross profit in our core Aggregates segment has improved 89% on a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n*Excludes more recent acquisitions.\nTTM 2Q'13 represents the cyclical low in aggregates volumes.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. Likewise, we believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and consistent with the basis by which investors analyze our operating results considering that freight and delivery services represent pass-through activities. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:\nGROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP\n\n\ufeff\nGROSS PROFIT MARGIN EXCLUDING FREIGHT AND DELIVERY REVENUES\n\n\ufeff\n \ufeff Includes freight to remote distribution sites. \n\ufeff\nSAME-STORE\nWe have provided certain information on a same-store basis. When discussing our financial results in comparison to prior periods, we may exclude the operating results of recently acquired/divested businesses that do not have comparable results in the periods being discussed. These recently acquired/divested businesses are disclosed in Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d This approach allows us to evaluate the performance of our operations on a comparable basis. We believe that measuring performance on a same-store basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how our operations are performing period over period without the effects of acquisition and divestiture activity. Our same-store information may not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities.\n\ufeff\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAggregates segment gross profit margin as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues is not a GAAP measure. We present this metric as it is consistent with the basis by which we review our operating results. We believe that this presentation is consistent with our competitors and meaningful to our investors as it excludes freight, delivery and transportation revenues, which are pass-through activities. It also excludes immaterial other revenues related to services, such as landfill tipping fees, that are derived from our aggregates business. Incremental gross profit as a percentage of freight-adjusted revenues represents the year-over-year change in gross profit divided by the year-over-year change in freight-adjusted revenues. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:\nAGGREGATES SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP\n\n\ufeff\nAGGREGATES SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF\nFREIGHT-ADJUSTED REVENUES\n\n \ufeff At the segment level, freight, delivery and transportation revenues include intersegment freight & delivery revenues, which are eliminated at the consolidated level. \n\ufeff\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGAAP does not define \"cash gross profit\" and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We present this metric for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance. We and the investment community use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliation of this metric to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:\n\ufeff\nCASH GROSS PROFIT\nCash gross profit adds back noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization to gross profit. Cash gross profit per ton is computed by dividing cash gross profit by tons shipped.\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nGAAP does not define \"Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization\u201d (EBITDA) and it should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We present this metric for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance. We use this metric to assess the operating performance of our business and for a basis of strategic planning and forecasting. We do not use this metric as a measure to allocate resources. We adjust EBITDA for certain items to provide a more consistent comparison of earnings performance from period to period.\nEBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\n \ufeff The 2016 amount includes a $4.3 million gain (reflected within Other operating income, net) for plant relocation reimbursement. \n\ufeff\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2015 and 2014 has been revised to conform with the 2016 presentation which no longer includes an adjustment for amortization of deferred revenue and charges associated with business development. Adjusting for amortization of deferred revenue is no longer meaningful as all periods presented include amortization of deferred revenue at amounts that are substantially equivalent. Additionally, we no longer exclude charges associated with business development as they are deemed to represent normal recurring operating expenses.\n2017 PROJECTED EBITDA\nThe following reconciliation to the mid-point of the range of 2017 Projected EBITDA excludes adjustments for the future outcome of legal proceedings, charges associated with divested operations, asset impairment and other unusual gains and losses due to the uncertainty in predicting these items.\n\n\ufeff\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTotal revenues include sales of product to customers, net of any discounts and taxes, and freight and delivery revenues billed to customers. Related freight and delivery costs are included in cost of revenues. This presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review our consolidated results of operations.

SALES AND MARKETING EXCELLENCE\nGoal: Remain the market supplier of choice in order to increase our market share while earning full and fair value for our products and services.\nExecution: We are winning more than our fair share of large project bids by leveraging our scale and extensive strong customer relationships.\n2. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE\nGoal: Run the industry's safest and most efficient operations by successfully leveraging and driving cost efficiencies to achieve 60% flow through of incremental aggregates freight-adjusted revenues.\nExecution: We are driving our cost of revenues down by leveraging our purchasing power and multi-modal logistics network and by better managing inventory levels. In 2016 and 2015, we exceeded our long-term flow through goal of 60% by achieving 65% and 67%, respectively, flow through of incremental aggregates freight-adjusted revenues.\n3. SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL (SAG) PRODUCTIVITY\nGoal: Continue to leverage SAG in order to achieve 6% of total revenues.\nExecution: We are leveraging our recently implemented common ERP platform and reorganized central shared services to reduce administrative expenses and enable rapid integration of acquired operations. As a result, SAG as a percentage of total revenues has decreased from 9.1% in 2014 to 8.8% in 2016.\n4. CAPITAL PRODUCTIVITY\nGoal: Drive improvement in capital turnover while maintaining the longer term health of our asset base.\nExecution: We are improving capital turnover by maximizing the lifecycle value of land holdings and optimizing working capital and inventory levels.\n5. PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\nGoal: Continue to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions and selectively enter new markets that meet our growth profile while divesting non-core businesses.\nExecution: In 2016, we expanded our aggregates distribution capabilities in Georgia and completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions in New Mexico and Texas. In 2015, we completed a swap of twelve ready-mixed concrete plants in California for thirteen asphalt plants primarily in Arizona. We also acquired three aggregates facilities and seven ready-mixed concrete plants in Arizona and New Mexico.\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOUR COMMITMENTS\nWe crush rocks for a living, but at its core, this is a relationship business. We are deeply committed to our customers and our people, and deeply embedded in our communities.\nOur commitment to customers - We have the capabilities to fulfill our customers' needs on large, complex jobs with unmatched performance and service and we aim to be the supplier of choice for smaller contractors. With all of our customers, we strive to maintain and improve our relationships, to provide outstanding value and service for a fair price by being a solution provider rather than simply an aggregates provider.\nOur commitment to our employees - We work hard to ensure our employees' safety and health, in a positive environment where each person can thrive. We are completely focused on the things that we can control, and it is here that our people continue to make all the difference: increasing unit profitability, delivering incremental earnings and improving our world-class aggregates franchise every day.\nOur commitment to our communities - Our people contribute to the cities, towns and neighborhoods where they live and work, in big ways and in small; from disaster relief to the support of education and a wide variety of other social causes and programs. At Vulcan, this means a great deal more than just financial support. Our people throughout the United States, and in Mexico, are generously volunteering their time, talent and energy to improve the world around them.\nOur commitment to the environment - We take a long-term approach that bears in mind the demands of the present and the needs of the future. As we continue to build on our legacy, we do so with a clear view of our responsibility to future generations.\nOur commitment to our shareholders - We work hard every day to generate returns that exceed market averages. We are good stewards, with responsible operating and capital project expenditures, to achieve a healthy return on our shareholders' investment in us. We will continue to strive to be the market leader, winning on margin performance, consistent strength of execution and pricing performance; earning a superior return on the very significant capital invested in our business.\nWe believe our ability to succeed stems directly from these commitments. Over the years, nearly six decades, we have built a strong, resilient and vital business on this foundation of doing things the right way. We expect this to continue for the decades to come.\n2016 ACQUISITIONS\nDuring 2016, we acquired the assets of the following businesses for total consideration of $33.3 million:\n \u00a7 an asphalt plant in New Mexico \n \u00a7 an aggregates facility in Texas \n \u00a7 a distribution business in Georgia to complement our aggregates logistics and distribution activities \nFor a detailed discussion of our acquisitions and divestitures, see Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures\u201d in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK\nThe strong fundamentals of our aggregates-focused business and the outstanding improvement in our core profitability have led to strong earnings growth during the last three years of recovery. In 2017, we expect continued growth across the vast majority of our markets and across each of the end use segments we serve. Our expectation for full year Adjusted EBITDA of $1.125 to $1.225 billion is driven by a continuing recovery in shipments, with higher levels of publicly funded construction activity just beginning to join the ongoing recovery in private demand, as well as a favorable pricing environment.\nThe following assumptions support our outlook for strong year-over-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA in 2017:\n \u00a7 Aggregates shipments growth of 5% to 8% from 2016, with growth weighted more toward the second half of the year \n \u00a7 Freight-adjusted aggregates price increase of 5% to 7%, with unit margins continuing to grow faster than pricing \n \u00a7 Asphalt Mix, Concrete and Calcium segment gross profit growth of approximately 15% \n \u00a7 SAG expenses of approximately $320 million, 2% higher than the prior year and excluding business development-related expenses \nOther expectations include:\n \u00a7 Core capital spending of approximately $300 million to support the increased level of shipments and further improve production costs and operating efficiencies \n \u00a7 Interest expense of approximately $140 million \n \u00a7 Depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense of approximately $300 million \n \u00a7 Effective tax rate of 28% \nWe remain focused on continuous, compounding improvement in profitability and cash flows. Our 2017 outlook reflects earnings growth and unit margin performance consistent with recent trends as well as our longer range goals. The flow-through of freight-adjusted revenues to gross profit in our Aggregates segment should remain in line with the long-term goal of greater than 60%. Since the beginning of this recovery, our efforts have resulted in Aggregates segment gross profit increasing $515 million on a 41 million ton increase in shipments. During this same period, unit gross profit in our core Aggregates segment has improved 89% on a trailing twelve month (TTM) basis.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n*Excludes more recent acquisitions.\nTTM 2Q'13 represents the cyclical low in aggregates volumes.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\n Part II \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGross profit margin excluding freight and delivery revenues is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (GAAP) measure.
