T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient's own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using our proprietary platforms, TriTAC, ProTriTAC and our new platform, TriTAC-XR, we are developing a pipeline of novel T cell engagers, initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In addition, to our product candidates utilizing our TriTAC technology, we have also nominated our first clinical candidate using our proprietary ProTriTAC platform, a prodrug version of our TriTAC platform, designed to expand the target space for T cell engagers and bring the TriTAC benefits to a broader number of patients.\nTriTAC\nWe currently have three TriTAC product candidates in clinical development. HPN328 is in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3, or DLL3, for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, and other DLL3-expressing tumors. HPN217 is in in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, for the treatment of multiple myeloma. HPN536 is in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other mesothelin-, or MSLN-, expressing solid tumors. As of March 10, 2022, we have discontinued further development of HPN424 as a treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC.\nTriTAC Pipeline Update\nHPN328\nIn January 2021, we announced the first patient was dosed with HPN328 in a Phase 1/2 trial as an investigational treatment of SCLC and other tumors associated with DLL3 expression. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update on our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. As of the December 2, 2021 data-cutoff date, fifteen patients had been enrolled in dose cohorts ranging from 15 \u00b5g to 7200 \u00b5g per week in both fixed and step dose cohorts administered once weekly by intravenous infusion. 15 patients with a median of 2 lines (range 1 to 5) of prior therapy have been enrolled and eligible patients include small cell lung cancer patients who have relapsed after platinum chemotherapy and patients with other malignancies with high grade neuroendocrine tumors associated with DLL3 expression. HPN328 has been well tolerated with Grade 1-2 CRS reported in 33% of patients, no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs were observed and maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, had not been reached. Among four patients with small cell lung cancer receiving the two highest doses tested to date, 1215 \u00b5g fixed dose and 3600-7200 \u00b5g step dose, three had target lesion reduction, including 1 confirmed RECIST partial response, or cPR. The patient with a cPR experienced a target lesion reduction of 53% at week 10. In March 2022, we received orphan drug designation for the treatment of SCLC. We plan to present initial interim clinical data in 2022. We intend to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose by the end of 2022.\nHPN217\nIn December 2021, we announced the interim results of ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217. As of the November 10, 2021 data cut-off date, 37 patients have been treated in 10 cohorts with fixed doses ranging from 5 to 2860 \u00b5g/week or a step dosing regimen of 1620 \u00b5g priming dose followed by a 3240 \u00b5g/week target dose. Premedication to minimize CRS includes dexamethasone and other standard therapies. Enrolled patients had a median of 7 prior therapies. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, occurring in greater than 20% were anemia, 17 patients (46%), fatigue, 12 patients (32%), and transient CRS, 9 patients (24%), No grade 3 or higher CRS was reported and one DLT was reported, grade 4 AST, which resolved. MTD has not been reached.\nClinical benefit was observed in the patients receiving higher doses. In eight disease evaluable patients enrolled at 2150 \u00b5g/week an ORR of 63% was reported (five out of eight patients) consisting of one stringent CR, one very good partial response, or VGPR, and three PRs including one patient with prior BCMA-targeting therapy exposure. The disease control rate, or DCR, was 88% based on seven out of eight patients. For the 2860 \u00b5g/week cohort consisting of five evaluable patients, the ORR was two out of five (40%) including a VGPR (previously reported as an unconfirmed CR), with a DCR of 60%. As of the data cutoff, all responders remained on study treatment.\nHPN217 demonstrated a dose proportional increase in Cmax and area under the curve, or AUC, with a median serum half-life of 74 hours (range of 38 - 197 hours), confirming half-life extension. Half-life, clearance rate, and volume of distribution were dose-independent, suggesting linear PK kinetics. Pharmacodynamic analysis shows a dose-dependent, transient increase in serum cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF\u03b1).\nIn January 2021, HPN217 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In March 2022, HPN217 received fast track designation for the treatment of relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma. We intend to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose for an expansion phase in the first half of 2022.\nHPN217 is covered by a global development and option agreement with AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie, and treatment of the first patient in the clinical trial triggered a $50 million milestone payment, which we received in June 2020. HPN217 targets B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, a well-validated target expressed on multiple myeloma cells. Harpoon is responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and we are actively enrolling patients in the dose escalation portion of the multi-country trial. Under the agreement with AbbVie, we are eligible to receive future payments totaling up to $430 million upon AbbVie's exercise of an exclusive license option and achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, in addition to royalties on commercial sales.\nHPN536\nHPN536 is a MSLN-targeting T cell engager, and we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for ovarian, pancreatic and other MSLN-expressing solid tumors. The study is collecting data to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of HPN536. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update on our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial, at the time of the December 2, 2021 data cutoff, dosing had occurred across 9 fixed-dose cohorts of 6 to 280ng/kg and 3 step dose cohort up to 1200ng/kg. Tumor types treated included late-stage ovarian and pancreatic cancers and mesothelioma.\nAs of December 2, 2021, HPN536 appears to be well tolerated. One CRS grade 3 occurred in the absence of dexamethasone premedication treatment. The CRS resolved, and the patient continued on study with dexamethasone premedication. As of the December 2, 2021 data cutoff date, no new DLTs had been observed other than the two previously noted from May 31, 2021 data cutoff. An MTD has not been identified and escalation to higher doses is underway. We recently opened and are actively recruiting a 7200 ng/kg cohort.\nHPN424\nIn March 2022, we announced the discontinuation of further clinical development for HPN424, our PSMA-targeting TriTAC. We intend to wind down the clinical study for the remainder of calendar year 2022, while ensuring that patients on study have access to HPN424 for their course of therapy.\nProTriTAC\nIn May 2020, as a part of our pipeline update, we also presented advancements in our second platform, ProTriTAC, which was designed to expand the universe of addressable targets and indications for T cell engagers. We have nominated the first ProTriTAC clinical candidate, HPN601, with Investigational New Drug application, or IND, enabling studies underway, and we expect to provide additional development updates later this year. Our ProTriTAC platform applies a prodrug concept to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor. ProTriTACs therefore have the potential for additional tumor specificity and enhanced safety profiles because they are designed to have limited interaction with their molecular targets in healthy tissue, allowing us to target tumor-associated antigens that may be more broadly expressed. When a ProTriTAC penetrates a tumor, tumor-associated proteases cleave off the blocking domain of the ProTriTAC, thereby enabling the engagement of T cells to subsequently kill tumor cells. This activation process also diminishes the half-life of the resulting T cell engager. If active molecules leave the tumor tissue, they are rapidly eliminated from the body, therefore further limiting the potential side effects in normal tissues.\nHPN601\nOur first ProTriTAC candidate is currently in preclinical development. HPN601 targets EPCAM, which is expressed on variety of solid tumors. Our initial focus is expected to be in gastrointestinal cancers. We plan to submit an IND for HPN601 as well as identify a second IND candidate from the ProTriTAC platform by the end of 2022.\nTriTAC-XR\nIn November 2021, we presented preclinical data on TriTAC-XR at the 35th Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, annual meeting. The poster presentation demonstrated the efficacy of the platform in vitro and in rodent models, and showed in non-human-primates that TriTAC-XR can produce PD effects similar to a TriTAC with significantly lower cytokine release than a comparable TriTAC. We plan to nominate an IND candidate from the TriTAC-XR platform by the end of 2022.\nBusiness Operations\nSince commencing operations in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development and manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, raising capital to support and expand such activities and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily from proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants, the sale of common stock, and payments received under our discovery collaboration agreement with AbbVie.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. Our net losses were $116.7 million, $49.9 million and $55.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.8 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund net losses, operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over time as we:\n\u2022continue the research and development of HPN328, HPN217, HPN536, and HPN601 as well as our other product candidates;\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022continue to invest in our technology platforms, including TriTAC, ProTriTAC and TriTAC-XR;\n\u2022maintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022implement operational, financial and management systems; and\n\u2022attract, hire and retain additional administrative, clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel.\nFurthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nIn January 2021, we closed a follow on public offering of 6,764,704 shares of our common stock, including 882,352 shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to us were approximately $107.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs payable by us.\nFrom January 2021 through December 31, 2021, pursuant to our Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, we received an aggregate of approximately $2.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or mitigate its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Our assessment to date continues to support that we have not experienced any material delays or significant financial impacts directly related to the pandemic other than some minor disruptions to clinical operations, including some disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain that affected and may continue to affect our drug supply, patient enrollment in some of our clinical trials and delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at our clinical trial sites. We will continue to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity, assets and operations, including our personnel, programs, expected timelines, expenses, third-party contract manufacturing, contract research organizations and clinical trials.\nWhile we are currently continuing our clinical trials we have underway in sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials, as a result of potential delays or difficulties in enrolling or assessing patients in our clinical trials, clinical site initiation, diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, interruption of key clinical trial activities, disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain, among other factors. While our third-party contract manufacturers have been operating at or near normal levels and while have not experienced any major interruptions to our contract manufacturers' processes, it is possible that the pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party contract manufacturers' ability to produce quantities of our product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the pandemic. Certain of our clinical trial sites have experienced, and others may experience in the future, delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at such sites, limitation or suspension of on-site visits by patients, or patients' reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. We and our contract research organizations may also need to make certain adjustments to the operation of our clinical trials in an effort to ensure the monitoring and safety of patients and minimize risk to trial integrity during the pandemic and generally. We could also see an impact on our ability to interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, personnel resources or otherwise.\nIn addition, in response to the ongoing spread of COVID-19, we have established testing protocols for personnel access to our headquarter offices and laboratory. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, assets, operations and clinical trials, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. See Risk factors-Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in many parts of the world and may result in significant disruptions which could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and at our clinical trial sites.\u201d for more information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations. We continue to actively monitor this situation and the possible effects on our business and operations.\nCollaborations with AbbVie\nDevelopment and Option Agreement\nOn November 20, 2019, we entered into a Development and Option Agreement, which we refer to, as amended, as the Development and Option Agreement, with AbbVie in connection with our HPN217 program, which targets B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA. Pursuant to such agreement, we granted to AbbVie an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to our patents and know-how applicable to the HPN217 program to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products arising from the HPN217 program and targeting BCMA, or HPN217 Products. Under the Development and Option Agreement, we filed an IND for HPN217 and are responsible for conducting clinical development activities pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development plan, including conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217, in order for AbbVie to determine whether it wishes to exercise its option to a worldwide, exclusive license to such HPN217 program. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in April 2020.\nUnder the Development and Option Agreement, AbbVie may exercise its license option at any time during a period commencing on the effective date of the agreement and expiring after a specified period following delivery by us of a specified data package arising from the first Phase 1/2 trial for the HPN217 Products. Following AbbVie's exercise of its option, and except for completion of certain development activities by us under the development plan, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of HPN217 and any other HPN217 Products. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for one HPN217 Product, for at least one indication, for use in each Major Market (as defined in the Development and Option Agreement).\nAbbVie paid an upfront payment of $30.0 million and, in June 2020, a development milestone payment of $50.0 million, as we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217 in April 2020. If AbbVie exercises its option, AbbVie will pay us an option exercise fee of $200.0 million. Following option exercise, AbbVie will be required to make further payments to us of up to $230.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for HPN217 Products. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of HPN217 Products at percentages ranging from the high single digits to the very low double digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Development and Option Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of HPN217 and other HPN217 Products, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years following first commercial sale of such HPN217 Product in such country.\nWe will recognize revenue under the Development and Option Agreement as the initial development activities are performed using an input method, according to the costs incurred as related to the estimated costs for the development and regulatory activities to be performed through the completion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217. Accordingly, of the $30.0 million upfront payment received in 2019 and $50.0 million development milestone received in 2020, $18.4 million and $13.8 million of revenue was recognized for the year ended 2021 and 2020, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $46.1 million of deferred revenue under the Development and Option Agreement.\nAmended and Restated Discovery Collaboration Agreement\nOn August 16, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or the First Amendment, with AbbVie, which amends the Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or, as amended by the First Amendment, the Restated Collaboration Agreement, entered on November 20, 2019, between us and AbbVie, which agreement amends and restates the Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement entered into between us and AbbVie, dated October 20, 2017 and amended April 3, 2019, or the Original Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, we and AbbVie agreed to include the ProTriTAC technology within the Restated Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Original Collaboration Agreement, we granted to AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary TriTAC technology together with soluble TCRs provided by AbbVie that bind to targets accepted by the parties. Under the terms of the Original Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie was granted the right to designate up to two targets for development of TriTAC constructs, which it selected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is permitted to designate two further targets, with an option to select up to four additional targets, selected during a specified period following the effective date, to be the subject of activities under the collaboration, and is granted a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that incorporate either our proprietary TriTAC platform technology, or (as a result of and pursuant to the First Amendment) our ProTriTAC platform technology, together with soluble T cell receptors, or TCRs. Such products may incorporate antibodies provided by AbbVie or by us. During a period of up to four years following the date of AbbVie's designation of each target for the products, and subject to confirmation of target availability, we and AbbVie will conduct certain research and discovery activities under a mutually agreed discovery and research plan in connection with the creation and evaluation of constructs comprising our proprietary TriTAC or ProTriTAC technologies, in conjunction with the soluble TCR or antibody sequences directed at the agreed upon targets of interest. We may not, including through any third party, develop or commercialize any competing product that binds to any of the included targets. As was the case under the Original Collaboration Agreement, following the discovery phase, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products that arise from the activities under the discovery plan. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one such product directed to each target for which the discovery activities were completed in each Major Market (as defined in the Restated Collaboration Agreement).\nIn addition to the upfront payment of $17.0 million already paid under the Original Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20.0 million under the Restated Collaboration Agreement for AbbVie's right to select two further targets and an option to select up to four further targets. AbbVie will be required to make payments to us, upon target selection, of $10.0 million for each target, for up to four additional targets selected by AbbVie. For each of the up to eight targets selected, we are eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for licensed products indicated for human therapeutic or prophylactic use. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of licensed products at percentages in the mid-single digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Restated Collaboration Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of each product, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country or ten years following first commercial sale of such product in such country. If licensed products are developed and commercialized for diagnostic or veterinary use, or certain screening or monitoring uses, the parties have agreed to negotiate an appropriate reduction in the economic terms applicable to such non-therapeutic and prophylactic applications.\nWe recognized revenue under the Original Collaboration Agreement over a period in which related research and development activities occur. Accordingly, of the $17.0 million upfront payment received in 2017, $4.3 million and $3.7 million of revenue was recognized during the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we recognized the full $17.0 million upfront payment related to the initial two targets.\nWe will recognize revenue under the Restated Collaboration Agreement over a period in which related research and development activities occur. Accordingly, of the $20.0 million upfront payment received in 2019, $0.9 million and zero of revenue was recognized for the year ended 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had $19.1 million of deferred revenue under the Restated Collaboration Agreement.\nThe Restated Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the date of the expiration of all AbbVie's royalty payment obligations in all countries. The Restated Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately for the insolvency of the other party or on 90 days' written notice for an uncured material breach of such agreement by the other party. AbbVie may also terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a target-by-target or country-by-country basis for any reason on 30 days' written notice to the Company. In addition, AbbVie may terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement immediately in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis if AbbVie considers in good faith that there has been a failure of the discovery or development efforts with respect to such target, or that further development or commercialization of products directed to such target is not advisable as a result of a serious safety issue.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our collaboration and license revenue to date is related to work performed by us under the Restated Collaboration Agreement and Development and Option Agreement, and is recognized when designated research and development services are performed. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments under the Original Collaboration Agreement or the Restated Collaboration Agreement. We expect that any collaboration and license revenue we generate from the Restated Collaboration Agreement and the Development and Option Agreement and any future collaboration partners will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments. Additionally, for research and development services that we recognize over time, we measure our progress using an input method. The input methods we use are based on the effort we expend or costs we incur toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. We estimate the amount of effort we expend, including the time we estimate it will take us to complete the activities, or costs we incur in a given period, relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results in a percentage that we multiply by the transaction price to determine the amount of revenue we recognize each period. This approach requires us to make numerous estimates and use significant judgement. If our estimates or judgements change over the course of the collaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in the current and future periods.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, and include salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, laboratory supplies, outsourced research and development expenses, professional services and allocated facilities-related costs. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We do not allocate our costs by product candidates, as our research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, and external costs, neither of which are tracked by product candidate. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple product candidate research and development programs. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and expand our pipeline of product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The actual probability of success for our product candidates may be affected by a variety of factors, including the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, early clinical data, investment in our clinical programs, the ability of collaborators to successfully develop our licensed product candidates, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. As a result of the uncertainties discussed above, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of our product candidates.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, allocated facilities costs and other expenses for outside professional services, including legal, human resource, audit and accounting services. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation. We expect to incur additional expenses as a result of operating as a public company, including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, Nasdaq and any other securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance expenses, investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services. We also expect to increase the size of our administrative staff and functions to support the growth of our business and the requirements of a public company.\nLitigation Settlement\nLitigation settlement is related to the damages settlement resulting from the Maverick Litigation described in Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income, net is primarily comprised of interest income and gains or losses realized on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net is primarily comprised of foreign currency transaction gains or losses related to certain transactions with European third-party vendors.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change ($)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change (%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Collaboration and license revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,444\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Litigation settlement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(116,751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,331\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,209\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-83\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(210\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>708\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(116,721\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(49,908\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nCollaboration and license revenue increased by $6.2 million, or 36%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase was primarily due to a $11.0 million increase in product and clinical development expense, research and technology services and pharmacology services due to continued development of our four product candidates, which included conducting preclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing drug supply to support ongoing clinical development, a $7.9 million increase in personnel-related expenses due to an increase in headcount, a $1.0 million increase in facility and other allocated expenses, which was offset by a $0.3 million decrease in consulting expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $2.1 million, or 13%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $3.0 million increase in personnel-related expenses from additional headcount, $0.3 million increase in other professional services to support the growth of our operations, offset by a $1.2 million decrease in legal related expenses associated with the Maverick Therapeutics, Inc., or Maverick, litigation incurred in 2020.\nLitigation Settlement\nLitigation settlement for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $50.0 million. On April 23, 2021, following a damages phase, the Delaware Chancery Court issued a memorandum opinion awarding Millennium Therapeutics, Inc. $38.2 million in damages, plus pre-judgment interest. On May 5, 2021, we paid the full amount of damages awarded by the Court, equal to $50.0 million, consisting of $38.2 million in damages plus $11.8 million in pre-judgment interest through May 5, 2021. See Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nInterest Income, net\nInterest income decreased by $1.2 million, or 83%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower interest yields on our cash, money-market and marketable securities balances and higher amortization of premiums associated marketable securities purchases.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense increased by $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to deferred offering costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nSince our inception and through December 31, 2021, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants, the sale of common stock, and upfront payments received by us from our collaboration and license agreements. As of December 31, 2021, we had $136.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, an accumulated deficit of $284.8 million and working capital of $78.6 million.\nIn January 2021, we sold an aggregate 6,764,704 shares of our common stock for $107.6 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nFrom January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, pursuant to our Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald, we received an aggregate of approximately $2.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock.\nWith respect to the Maverick Litigation described in Note 6 Commitments and Contingencies to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report, on May 5, 2021, we paid the full amount of damages awarded by the Court, equal to $50.0 million, consisting of $38.2 million in damages plus $11.8 million in pre-judgment interest through May 5, 2021.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial costs in order to conduct research and development activities necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Additional capital will be needed to undertake these activities and commercialization efforts, and, therefore, we intend to raise such capital through the issuance of additional equity, borrowings, and potentially strategic alliances with other companies. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels or on acceptable terms, we could be required to significantly reduce operating expenses and delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate some of the development programs or commercialization efforts, out-license intellectual property rights to our product candidates and sell unsecured assets, or a combination of the above, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or out ability to fund our scheduled obligations on a timely basis or at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and is likely to continue to result, in significant national and global economic disruption and may adversely affect our business. Uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, we are uncertain as to what effect the pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. We are actively monitoring this situation and the possible effects on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and personnel. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to curb its spread, currently we are not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic to our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. If the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our results of operations.\nCapital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are to fund net losses and operating expenses, which consist primarily of funding our clinical and preclinical trials, research and development expenditures and related personnel costs. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. The timing and amount of our future funding requirements depends on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our preclinical studies, clinical trials and other related activities;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies, of our product candidates and any products that we may develop;\n\u2022the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022the cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022the terms and timing of any other collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022the timing, receipt and amount of sales, profit sharing or royalties, if any, from our potential products;\n\u2022the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies, although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions;\n\u2022the compliance and administrative costs associated with being a public company; and\n\u2022the cost of attracting, hiring and retaining additional administrative, clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel.\nIn March 2020, we entered into a Controlled Equity OfferingSMSales Agreement, or Sales Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor Fitzgerald, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion through Cantor Fitzgerald, as our sales agent, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million. Cantor Fitzgerald may sell the common stock by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering\u201d as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through The Nasdaq Global Select Market or on any other existing trading market for our common stock. Any shares of our common stock sold will be issued pursuant to our shelf registration statement\non Form S-3 (File No. 333-237175). We will pay Cantor Fitzgerald a commission up to 3.0% of the gross sales proceeds of any shares of our common stock sold through Cantor Fitzgerald under the Sales Agreement. Through December 31, 2021, we had sold a total of 330,222 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of $5.8 million. We have approximately $69.0 million of the maximum aggregate offering price of $75.0 million remaining.\nBased on our current business plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these audited financial statements. However, we will require additional capital in order to complete development of our product candidates and commercialize our products, if approved. We may seek to raise any necessary additional capital through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund our operations or on terms favorable to us. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or suspend one or more of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, research and development programs or commercialization efforts. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we may enter into additional collaborations with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated preclinical studies and clinical trials. To the extent that we raise additional capital through additional collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we do raise additional capital through public or private equity or convertible debt offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders' rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing, we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, operating and capital leases, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nPlease see the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements and the challenges we may face in raising capital.\nCash Flows\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(122,154\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,616\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(63,626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(67,566\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nIn 2021, cash used in operating activities was $122.2 million, which consisted of a net loss of $116.7 million and a net change of $19.9 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $14.5 million in non-cash charges. The non-cash charges consisted of stock-based compensation of $9.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $2.2 million, amortization operating right-of-use lease asset of $0.5 million and net amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $2.4 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of $23.7 million resulting from the recognition of revenue related to the AbbVie Restated Collaboration Agreement and the Development Option Agreement, a decrease of $1.6 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, a net decrease of $1.3 million in operating lease obligations which was offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of $2.9 million primarily related to timing for ongoing research and development activities, and an increase of $0.5 million in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payments made for operating costs.\nIn 2020, cash used in operating activities was $8.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $49.9 million and a net change of $33.4 million in our net operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $7.9 million in non-cash charges. The non-cash charges consisted of stock-based compensation of $4.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $2.1 million, amortization operating right-of-use lease asset of $0.4 million and net amortization of premiums and discounts on marketable securities of $0.5 million. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $31.5 million resulting from the upfront payments of $50 million cash milestone received from AbbVie related to the Development Option Agreement in June 2020 and an increase in accrued liabilities of $6.1 million primarily related to timing for ongoing research and development activities, which was\noffset by a decrease of $1.5 million in prepaid expenses and other assets, a decrease of $1.2 million in accounts payable resulting from the timing of payments made for operating costs and a decrease of $1.4 million in operating lease obligations.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by investing activities of $34.4 million primarily related to net maturities and purchases of marketable securities.\nIn 2020, cash used in investing activities of $63.6 million primarily related to purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment consisting primarily of laboratory equipment offset by the maturity and sale of marketable securities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nIn 2021, cash provided by financing activities of $111.5 million was primarily from $107.6 million in net proceeds from the follow-on offering completed in January 2021, $2.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald through December 31, 2021, $0.6 million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and $0.6 million from purchases of our common stock under our 2019 employee stock purchase plan.\nIn 2020, cash provided by financing activities of $4.7 million was primarily related to proceeds received from the sale of our common stock pursuant to our Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald in October 2020 and November 2020, or net proceeds of approximately $3.0 million. In addition, we received $1.7 million cash from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan.\nContractual Obligations and Other Commitments\nContractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 represent operating lease obligations related to our currently occupied premises at 131 Oyster Point Blvd in South San Francisco, California that commenced in July 2019 and expires in June 2027. The initial annual base rent is approximately $2.2 million, and such amount will increase by 3.5% annually on each anniversary of the commencement date, equaling approximately $20.0 million over the eight-year lease term. In connection with the lease, we will maintain a letter of credit for the benefit of the landlord in the amount of $0.5 million. Under the lease agreement, we have an option to extend the lease for an additional period of eight years. As of December 31, 2021, we have not determined whether we will exercise our option to extend the lease term.\nIn December 2016, we entered into a royalty transfer agreement with MPM Oncology Charitable Foundation, Inc. and UBS Optimus Foundation pursuant to which we will pay 0.5% of our annual global net sales to each of the counterparties for products that incorporate or utilize intellectual property that was discovered or developed by us prior to our initial public offering.\nIn October 2015, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with AGC Biologics, Inc. (formerly known as CMC ICOS Biologics, Inc.), or AGC, for certain manufacturing-related technology, and in July 2016, we entered into a development and manufacturing agreement with AGC. Pursuant to these agreements, so long as AGC is our exclusive manufacturer, we will not owe AGC any milestone or royalty payments for the use of their manufacturing technology. However, if AGC is no longer our exclusive manufacturer, and we still use such technology, we will owe AGC specified milestones of up to $350,000 per specified product and a royalty on net sales of these products of less than 1%. We have an option to buy out these royalty obligations by making a one-time payment to AGC in a dollar amount in the mid-single digit millions. See Business-Collaboration and License Agreements-Agreements with AGC Biologics, Inc.\u201d\nIn addition, we enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations for clinical trials and with vendors for preclinical studies and other services and products for operating purposes, which are generally cancelable upon written notice. These payments are not included in this table of contractual obligations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated, and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue Recognition\nTo date, all of our revenue has been derived from our collaboration and license agreements entered into with AbbVie and Werewolf Therapeutics. The terms of these arrangements include payments to us for the following: non-refundable, upfront license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, and royalties on net sales of licensed products.\nRevenue is recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606. This standard applies to all contracts with customers, except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards, such as leases, insurance, collaboration arrangements and financial instruments. In accordance with ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nTo determine revenue recognition for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or Topic 606, we perform the following five steps in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as we fulfill our obligations under each of these agreements: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including any constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy each performance obligation.\nWe only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods and services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract that falls under the scope of Topic 606, determine those that are performance obligations and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price may be, but is not presumed to be, the contract price. In determining the allocation, we maximize the use of observable inputs. When the stand-alone selling price of a good or service is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation using assumptions that require judgment. Acceptable estimation methods include, but are not limited to: (i) the adjusted market assessment approach, (ii) the expected cost plus margin approach, and (iii) the residual approach (when the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable and is either highly variable or uncertain). In order for the residual approach to be used, we must demonstrate that (a) there are observable stand-alone selling prices for one or more of the performance obligations and (b) one of the two criteria in ASC 606-10- 32-34(c)(1) and (2) is met. The residual approach cannot be used if it would result in a stand-alone selling price of zero for a performance obligation, as a performance obligation, by definition, has value on a stand-alone basis.\nAn option in a contract to acquire additional goods or services gives rise to a performance obligation only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it would not receive without entering into that contract. Factors that we consider in evaluating whether an option represents a material right include, but are not limited to: (i) the overall objective of the arrangement, (ii) the benefit the collaborator might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option, (iii) the cost to exercise the option (e.g. priced at a significant and incremental discount) and (iv) the likelihood that the option will be exercised. With respect to options determined to be performance obligations, we recognize revenue when those future goods or services are transferred or when the options expire.\nWe enter into corporate collaborations under which we may obtain upfront license fees, research and development funding, and development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments. Our performance obligations under these arrangements may include licenses of intellectual property, distribution rights, research and development services, delivery of manufactured product and/or participation on joint steering committees.\nUpfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due, and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future period until we perform our obligations under these arrangements. Amounts payable to us are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional.\nSee Note 7 Collaboration & License Agreements to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional details regarding our collaboration arrangements with AbbVie.\nResearch and Development Expenses and Accrued Research and Development Costs\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expenses consist of personnel costs for our research and product development employees. Also included are non-personnel costs such as professional fees payable to third parties for preclinical and preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services, production of materials for clinical trials, laboratory supplies and equipment maintenance and depreciation, intellectual property licenses and other consulting costs. We estimate preclinical and clinical study and research expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to contracts with research institutions that conduct and manage preclinical studies, clinical trials and research services on our behalf. We estimate these expenses based on discussions with management and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services and the contracted fees to be paid for such services. We record the estimated costs of research and development activities based upon the estimated amount services provided but not yet invoiced, and include these costs in development expenses. We accrue for these costs based on factors such as estimates of the work completed and in accordance with agreements established with our third-party service provides under the service agreements. We make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrued liabilities balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accrued liabilities. We have not experienced any material differences between accrued costs and actual costs incurred. However, the status and timing of actual services performed may vary from our estimates, resulting in adjustments to expense in future periods. Changes in these estimates that result in material changes to our accruals could materially affect our results of operations. Payments associated with licensing agreements to acquire exclusive license to develop, use, manufacture and commercialize products that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have alternate future use are expensed as incurred.\nPayments made to third parties under these arrangements in advance of the performance of the related services by the third parties are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered. Such payments are evaluated for current or long-term classification based on when such services are expected to be received.\nStock-Based-Compensation\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees, directors and non-employees, based on estimated fair values of the awards on the grant date and recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.\nThe fair value of options is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The calculation of stock-based compensation expense requires that we make certain assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculations, including the expected term (weighted-average period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding), the expected volatility of our common stock, the related risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend. We have elected to recognize forfeitures of share-based payment awards as they occur.\nChanges in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value and ultimately how much stock-based compensation expense is recognized. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. We maintain a stock-based compensation plan as a long-term incentive for employees, consultants and members of our board of directors. The plan allows for the issuance of non-statutory options, or NSOs, and incentive stock options to employees and NSOs to nonemployees.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options granted to our employees on the grant date, and rights to acquire stock granted under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nFair Value of Common Stock\nPrior to our IPO in February 2019, the fair values of the shares of common stock underlying our share-based awards were estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock prior to our February 2019 IPO, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including our stage of development; our actual operating results and financial performance; progress of our research and development efforts; conditions in the industry and economy in general; the rights, preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the holders of our common stock, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions; equity market conditions affecting comparable public companies; the lack of marketability of our common stock and the results of independent third-party valuations. Valuations of our common stock were prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2013 Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.\nFor our valuations performed prior to December 31, 2018, we used the Option Pricing Model (OPM) Backsolve method to estimate the fair value of our common stock. In an option pricing method, or OPM, framework, the backsolve method for inferring the equity value implied by a recent financing transaction involves making assumptions for the expected time to liquidity, volatility and risk-free rate and then solving for the value of equity such that value for the most recent financing equals the amount paid. Furthermore, as of each of the valuation dates prior to December 31, 2018, we were at an early stage of development and future liquidity events were difficult to forecast. We applied a discount for lack of marketability to account for a lack of access to an active public market.\nSubsequent to the completion of our IPO in February 2019, our board of directors determines the fair value of our common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant on the primary stock exchange on which our common stock is traded.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date that we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, these financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with the new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We early adopted ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606), ASU 2016-09, Stock Compensation-Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, ASU No. 2016-02, (Topic 842), Leases, as the JOBS Act does not preclude an emerging growth company from early adopting a new or revised accounting standard earlier than the time that such standard applies to private companies. We expect to use the extended transition period for any other new or revised accounting standards during the period in which we remain an emerging growth company.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of our first fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenues of at least $1.07 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.", "summary": "This report provides an overview of a clinical-stage immunotherapy company's financial condition and operations, as well as updates on its product candidates, collaborations, and business operations.

T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient's own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using our proprietary platforms, TriTAC, ProTriTAC and our new platform, TriTAC-XR, we are developing a pipeline of novel T cell engagers, initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In addition, to our product candidates utilizing our TriTAC technology, we have also nominated our first clinical candidate using our proprietary ProTriTAC platform, a prodrug version of our TriTAC platform, designed to expand the target space for T cell engagers and bring the TriTAC benefits to a broader number of patients.\nTriTAC\nWe currently have three TriTAC product candidates in clinical development. HPN328 is in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3, or DLL3, for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, and other DLL3-expressing tumors. HPN217 is in in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, for the treatment of multiple myeloma. HPN536 is in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other mesothelin-, or MSLN-, expressing solid tumors. As of March 10, 2022, we have discontinued further development of HPN424 as a treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC.\nTriTAC Pipeline Update\nHPN328\nIn January 2021, we announced the first patient was dosed with HPN328 in a Phase 1/2 trial as an investigational treatment of SCLC and other tumors associated with DLL3 expression. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update on our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. As of the December 2, 2021 data-cutoff date, fifteen patients had been enrolled in dose cohorts ranging from 15 \u00b5g to 7200 \u00b5g per week in both fixed and step dose cohorts administered once weekly by intravenous infusion. 15 patients with a median of 2 lines (range 1 to 5) of prior therapy have been enrolled and eligible patients include small cell lung cancer patients who have relapsed after platinum chemotherapy and patients with other malignancies with high grade neuroendocrine tumors associated with DLL3 expression. HPN328 has been well tolerated with Grade 1-2 CRS reported in 33% of patients, no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs were observed and maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, had not been reached. Among four patients with small cell lung cancer receiving the two highest doses tested to date, 1215 \u00b5g fixed dose and 3600-7200 \u00b5g step dose, three had target lesion reduction, including 1 confirmed RECIST partial response, or cPR. The patient with a cPR experienced a target lesion reduction of 53% at week 10. In March 2022, we received orphan drug designation for the treatment of SCLC. We plan to present initial interim clinical data in 2022. We intend to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose by the end of 2022.\nHPN217\nIn December 2021, we announced the interim results of ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217. As of the November 10, 2021 data cut-off date, 37 patients have been treated in 10 cohorts with fixed doses ranging from 5 to 2860 \u00b5g/week or a step dosing regimen of 1620 \u00b5g priming dose followed by a 3240 \u00b5g/week target dose. Premedication to minimize CRS includes dexamethasone and other standard therapies. Enrolled patients had a median of 7 prior therapies. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, occurring in greater than 20% were anemia, 17 patients (46%), fatigue, 12 patients (32%), and transient CRS, 9 patients (24%), No grade 3 or higher CRS was reported and one DLT was reported, grade 4 AST, which resolved. MTD has not been reached.\nClinical benefit was observed in the patients receiving higher doses. In eight disease evaluable patients enrolled at 2150 \u00b5g/week an ORR of 63% was reported (five out of eight patients) consisting of one stringent CR, one very good partial response, or VGPR, and three PRs including one patient with prior BCMA-targeting therapy exposure. The disease control rate, or DCR, was 88% based on seven out of eight patients. For the 2860 \u00b5g/week cohort consisting of five evaluable patients, the ORR was two out of five (40%) including a VGPR (previously reported as an unconfirmed CR), with a DCR of 60%. As of the data cutoff, all responders remained on study treatment.\nHPN217 demonstrated a dose proportional increase in Cmax and area under the curve, or AUC, with a median serum half-life of 74 hours (range of 38 - 197 hours), confirming half-life extension. Half-life, clearance rate, and volume of distribution were dose-independent, suggesting linear PK kinetics. Pharmacodynamic analysis shows a dose-dependent, transient increase in serum cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF\u03b1).\nIn January 2021, HPN217 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In March 2022, HPN217 received fast track designation for the treatment of relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma. We intend to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose for an expansion phase in the first half of 2022.\nHPN217 is covered by a global development and option agreement with AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie, and treatment of the first patient in the clinical trial triggered a $50 million milestone payment, which we received in June 2020. HPN217 targets B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, a well-validated target expressed on multiple myeloma cells. Harpoon is responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and we are actively enrolling patients in the dose escalation portion of the multi-country trial. Under the agreement with AbbVie, we are eligible to receive future payments totaling up to $430 million upon AbbVie's exercise of an exclusive license option and achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, in addition to royalties on commercial sales.\nHPN536\nHPN536 is a MSLN-targeting T cell engager, and we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for ovarian, pancreatic and other MSLN-expressing solid tumors. The study is collecting data to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of HPN536. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update on our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial, at the time of the December 2, 2021 data cutoff, dosing had occurred across 9 fixed-dose cohorts of 6 to 280ng/kg and 3 step dose cohort up to 1200ng/kg. Tumor types treated included late-stage ovarian and pancreatic cancers and mesothelioma.\nAs of December 2, 2021, HPN536 appears to be well tolerated. One CRS grade 3 occurred in the absence of dexamethasone premedication treatment. The CRS resolved, and the patient continued on study with dexamethasone premedication. As of the December 2, 2021 data cutoff date, no new DLTs had been observed other than the two previously noted from May 31, 2021 data cutoff. An MTD has not been identified and escalation to higher doses is underway. We recently opened and are actively recruiting a 7200 ng/kg cohort.\nHPN424\nIn March 2022, we announced the discontinuation of further clinical development for HPN424, our PSMA-targeting TriTAC. We intend to wind down the clinical study for the remainder of calendar year 2022, while ensuring that patients on study have access to HPN424 for their course of therapy.\nProTriTAC\nIn May 2020, as a part of our pipeline update, we also presented advancements in our second platform, ProTriTAC, which was designed to expand the universe of addressable targets and indications for T cell engagers. We have nominated the first ProTriTAC clinical candidate, HPN601, with Investigational New Drug application, or IND, enabling studies underway, and we expect to provide additional development updates later this year. Our ProTriTAC platform applies a prodrug concept to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor. ProTriTACs therefore have the potential for additional tumor specificity and enhanced safety profiles because they are designed to have limited interaction with their molecular targets in healthy tissue, allowing us to target tumor-associated antigens that may be more broadly expressed. When a ProTriTAC penetrates a tumor, tumor-associated proteases cleave off the blocking domain of the ProTriTAC, thereby enabling the engagement of T cells to subsequently kill tumor cells. This activation process also diminishes the half-life of the resulting T cell engager. If active molecules leave the tumor tissue, they are rapidly eliminated from the body, therefore further limiting the potential side effects in normal tissues.\nHPN601\nOur first ProTriTAC candidate is currently in preclinical development. HPN601 targets EPCAM, which is expressed on variety of solid tumors. Our initial focus is expected to be in gastrointestinal cancers. We plan to submit an IND for HPN601 as well as identify a second IND candidate from the ProTriTAC platform by the end of 2022.\nTriTAC-XR\nIn November 2021, we presented preclinical data on TriTAC-XR at the 35th Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, annual meeting. The poster presentation demonstrated the efficacy of the platform in vitro and in rodent models, and showed in non-human-primates that TriTAC-XR can produce PD effects similar to a TriTAC with significantly lower cytokine release than a comparable TriTAC. We plan to nominate an IND candidate from the TriTAC-XR platform by the end of 2022.\nBusiness Operations\nSince commencing operations in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development and manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, raising capital to support and expand such activities and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily from proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants, the sale of common stock, and payments received under our discovery collaboration agreement with AbbVie.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. Our net losses were $116.7 million, $49.9 million and $55.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.8 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund net losses, operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over time as we:\n\u2022continue the research and development of HPN328, HPN217, HPN536, and HPN601 as well as our other product candidates;\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022continue to invest in our technology platforms, including TriTAC, ProTriTAC and TriTAC-XR;\n\u2022maintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022implement operational, financial and management systems; and\n\u2022attract, hire and retain additional administrative, clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel.\nFurthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nIn January 2021, we closed a follow on public offering of 6,764,704 shares of our common stock, including 882,352 shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to us were approximately $107.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs payable by us.\nFrom January 2021 through December 31, 2021, pursuant to our Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, we received an aggregate of approximately $2.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or mitigate its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Our assessment to date continues to support that we have not experienced any material delays or significant financial impacts directly related to the pandemic other than some minor disruptions to clinical operations, including some disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain that affected and may continue to affect our drug supply, patient enrollment in some of our clinical trials and delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at our clinical trial sites. We will continue to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity, assets and operations, including our personnel, programs, expected timelines, expenses, third-party contract manufacturing, contract research organizations and clinical trials.\nWhile we are currently continuing our clinical trials we have underway in sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials, as a result of potential delays or difficulties in enrolling or assessing patients in our clinical trials, clinical site initiation, diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, interruption of key clinical trial activities, disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain, among other factors. While our third-party contract manufacturers have been operating at or near normal levels and while have not experienced any major interruptions to our contract manufacturers' processes, it is possible that the pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party contract manufacturers' ability to produce quantities of our product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the pandemic. Certain of our clinical trial sites have experienced, and others may experience in the future, delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at such sites, limitation or suspension of on-site visits by patients, or patients' reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. We and our contract research organizations may also need to make certain adjustments to the operation of our clinical trials in an effort to ensure the monitoring and safety of patients and minimize risk to trial integrity during the pandemic and generally. We could also see an impact on our ability to interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, personnel resources or otherwise.\nIn addition, in response to the ongoing spread of COVID-19, we have established testing protocols for personnel access to our headquarter offices and laboratory. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, assets, operations and clinical trials, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. See Risk factors-Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in many parts of the world and may result in significant disruptions which could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and at our clinical trial sites.\u201d for more information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations. We continue to actively monitor this situation and the possible effects on our business and operations.\nCollaborations with AbbVie\nDevelopment and Option Agreement\nOn November 20, 2019, we entered into a Development and Option Agreement, which we refer to, as amended, as the Development and Option Agreement, with AbbVie in connection with our HPN217 program, which targets B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA. Pursuant to such agreement, we granted to AbbVie an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to our patents and know-how applicable to the HPN217 program to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products arising from the HPN217 program and targeting BCMA, or HPN217 Products. Under the Development and Option Agreement, we filed an IND for HPN217 and are responsible for conducting clinical development activities pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development plan, including conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217, in order for AbbVie to determine whether it wishes to exercise its option to a worldwide, exclusive license to such HPN217 program. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in April 2020.\nUnder the Development and Option Agreement, AbbVie may exercise its license option at any time during a period commencing on the effective date of the agreement and expiring after a specified period following delivery by us of a specified data package arising from the first Phase 1/2 trial for the HPN217 Products. Following AbbVie's exercise of its option, and except for completion of certain development activities by us under the development plan, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of HPN217 and any other HPN217 Products. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for one HPN217 Product, for at least one indication, for use in each Major Market (as defined in the Development and Option Agreement).\nAbbVie paid an upfront payment of $30.0 million and, in June 2020, a development milestone payment of $50.0 million, as we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217 in April 2020. If AbbVie exercises its option, AbbVie will pay us an option exercise fee of $200.0 million. Following option exercise, AbbVie will be required to make further payments to us of up to $230.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for HPN217 Products. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of HPN217 Products at percentages ranging from the high single digits to the very low double digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Development and Option Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of HPN217 and other HPN217 Products, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years following first commercial sale of such HPN217 Product in such country.\nWe will recognize revenue under the Development and Option Agreement as the initial development activities are performed using an input method, according to the costs incurred as related to the estimated costs for the development and regulatory activities to be performed through the completion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217. Accordingly, of the $30.0 million upfront payment received in 2019 and $50.0 million development milestone received in 2020, $18.4 million and $13.8 million of revenue was recognized for the year ended 2021 and 2020, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $46.1 million of deferred revenue under the Development and Option Agreement.\nAmended and Restated Discovery Collaboration Agreement\nOn August 16, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or the First Amendment, with AbbVie, which amends the Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or, as amended by the First Amendment, the Restated Collaboration Agreement, entered on November 20, 2019, between us and AbbVie, which agreement amends and restates the Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement entered into between us and AbbVie, dated October 20, 2017 and amended April 3, 2019, or the Original Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, we and AbbVie agreed to include the ProTriTAC technology within the Restated Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Original Collaboration Agreement, we granted to AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary TriTAC technology together with soluble TCRs provided by AbbVie that bind to targets accepted by the parties. Under the terms of the Original Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie was granted the right to designate up to two targets for development of TriTAC constructs, which it selected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is permitted to designate two further targets, with an option to select up to four additional targets, selected during a specified period following the effective date, to be the subject of activities under the collaboration, and is granted a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that incorporate either our proprietary TriTAC platform technology, or (as a result of and pursuant to the First Amendment) our ProTriTAC platform technology, together with soluble T cell receptors, or TCRs. Such products may incorporate antibodies provided by AbbVie or by us. During a period of up to four years following the date of AbbVie's designation of each target for the products, and subject to confirmation of target availability, we and AbbVie will conduct certain research and discovery activities under a mutually agreed discovery and research plan in connection with the creation and evaluation of constructs comprising our proprietary TriTAC or ProTriTAC technologies, in conjunction with the soluble TCR or antibody sequences directed at the agreed upon targets of interest. We may not, including through any third party, develop or commercialize any competing product that binds to any of the included targets. As was the case under the Original Collaboration Agreement, following the discovery phase, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products that arise from the activities under the discovery plan. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one such product directed to each target for which the discovery activities were completed in each Major Market (as defined in the Restated Collaboration Agreement).\nIn addition to the upfront payment of $17.0 million already paid under the Original Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20.0 million under the Restated Collaboration Agreement for AbbVie's right to select two further targets and an option to select up to four further targets. AbbVie will be required to make payments to us, upon target selection, of $10.0 million for each target, for up to four additional targets selected by AbbVie. For each of the up to eight targets selected, we are eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for licensed products indicated for human therapeutic or prophylactic use. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of licensed products at percentages in the mid-single digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Restated Collaboration Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of each product, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country or ten years following first commercial sale of such product in such country. If licensed products are developed and commercialized for diagnostic or veterinary use, or certain screening or monitoring uses, the parties have agreed to negotiate an appropriate reduction in the economic terms applicable to such non-therapeutic and prophylactic applications.\nWe recognized revenue under the Original Collaboration Agreement over a period in which related research and development activities occur. Accordingly, of the $17.0 million upfront payment received in 2017, $4.3 million and $3.7 million of revenue was recognized during the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we recognized the full $17.0 million upfront payment related to the initial two targets.\nWe will recognize revenue under the Restated Collaboration Agreement over a period in which related research and development activities occur. Accordingly, of the $20.0 million upfront payment received in 2019, $0.9 million and zero of revenue was recognized for the year ended 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had $19.1 million of deferred revenue under the Restated Collaboration Agreement.\nThe Restated Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the date of the expiration of all AbbVie's royalty payment obligations in all countries. The Restated Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately for the insolvency of the other party or on 90 days' written notice for an uncured material breach of such agreement by the other party. AbbVie may also terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a target-by-target or country-by-country basis for any reason on 30 days' written notice to the Company. In addition, AbbVie may terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement immediately in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis if AbbVie considers in good faith that there has been a failure of the discovery or development efforts with respect to such target, or that further development or commercialization of products directed to such target is not advisable as a result of a serious safety issue.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our collaboration and license revenue to date is related to work performed by us under the Restated Collaboration Agreement and Development and Option Agreement, and is recognized when designated research and development services are performed. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments under the Original Collaboration Agreement or the Restated Collaboration Agreement. We expect that any collaboration and license revenue we generate from the Restated Collaboration Agreement and the Development and Option Agreement and any future collaboration partners will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments. Additionally, for research and development services that we recognize over time, we measure our progress using an input method. The input methods we use are based on the effort we expend or costs we incur toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. We estimate the amount of effort we expend, including the time we estimate it will take us to complete the activities, or costs we incur in a given period, relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results in a percentage that we multiply by the transaction price to determine the amount of revenue we recognize each period. This approach requires us to make numerous estimates and use significant judgement. If our estimates or judgements change over the course of the collaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in the current and future periods.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, and include salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, laboratory supplies, outsourced research and development expenses, professional services and allocated facilities-related costs. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We do not allocate our costs by product candidates, as our research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, and external costs, neither of which are tracked by product candidate. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple product candidate research and development programs. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and expand our pipeline of product candidates. The process of conducting the necessary preclinical and clinical research to obtain regulatory", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

T cell engagers are engineered proteins that direct a patient's own T cells to kill target cells that express specific proteins, or antigens, carried by the target cells. Using our proprietary platforms, TriTAC, ProTriTAC and our new platform, TriTAC-XR, we are developing a pipeline of novel T cell engagers, initially focused on the treatment of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In addition, to our product candidates utilizing our TriTAC technology, we have also nominated our first clinical candidate using our proprietary ProTriTAC platform, a prodrug version of our TriTAC platform, designed to expand the target space for T cell engagers and bring the TriTAC benefits to a broader number of patients.\nTriTAC\nWe currently have three TriTAC product candidates in clinical development. HPN328 is in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting Delta-like canonical Notch ligand 3, or DLL3, for the treatment of small cell lung cancer, or SCLC, and other DLL3-expressing tumors. HPN217 is in in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial targeting B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, for the treatment of multiple myeloma. HPN536 is in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for the treatment of ovarian cancer and other mesothelin-, or MSLN-, expressing solid tumors. As of March 10, 2022, we have discontinued further development of HPN424 as a treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or mCRPC.\nTriTAC Pipeline Update\nHPN328\nIn January 2021, we announced the first patient was dosed with HPN328 in a Phase 1/2 trial as an investigational treatment of SCLC and other tumors associated with DLL3 expression. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update on our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial. As of the December 2, 2021 data-cutoff date, fifteen patients had been enrolled in dose cohorts ranging from 15 \u00b5g to 7200 \u00b5g per week in both fixed and step dose cohorts administered once weekly by intravenous infusion. 15 patients with a median of 2 lines (range 1 to 5) of prior therapy have been enrolled and eligible patients include small cell lung cancer patients who have relapsed after platinum chemotherapy and patients with other malignancies with high grade neuroendocrine tumors associated with DLL3 expression. HPN328 has been well tolerated with Grade 1-2 CRS reported in 33% of patients, no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs were observed and maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, had not been reached. Among four patients with small cell lung cancer receiving the two highest doses tested to date, 1215 \u00b5g fixed dose and 3600-7200 \u00b5g step dose, three had target lesion reduction, including 1 confirmed RECIST partial response, or cPR. The patient with a cPR experienced a target lesion reduction of 53% at week 10. In March 2022, we received orphan drug designation for the treatment of SCLC. We plan to present initial interim clinical data in 2022. We intend to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose by the end of 2022.\nHPN217\nIn December 2021, we announced the interim results of ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217. As of the November 10, 2021 data cut-off date, 37 patients have been treated in 10 cohorts with fixed doses ranging from 5 to 2860 \u00b5g/week or a step dosing regimen of 1620 \u00b5g priming dose followed by a 3240 \u00b5g/week target dose. Premedication to minimize CRS includes dexamethasone and other standard therapies. Enrolled patients had a median of 7 prior therapies. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, occurring in greater than 20% were anemia, 17 patients (46%), fatigue, 12 patients (32%), and transient CRS, 9 patients (24%), No grade 3 or higher CRS was reported and one DLT was reported, grade 4 AST, which resolved. MTD has not been reached.\nClinical benefit was observed in the patients receiving higher doses. In eight disease evaluable patients enrolled at 2150 \u00b5g/week an ORR of 63% was reported (five out of eight patients) consisting of one stringent CR, one very good partial response, or VGPR, and three PRs including one patient with prior BCMA-targeting therapy exposure. The disease control rate, or DCR, was 88% based on seven out of eight patients. For the 2860 \u00b5g/week cohort consisting of five evaluable patients, the ORR was two out of five (40%) including a VGPR (previously reported as an unconfirmed CR), with a DCR of 60%. As of the data cutoff, all responders remained on study treatment.\nHPN217 demonstrated a dose proportional increase in Cmax and area under the curve, or AUC, with a median serum half-life of 74 hours (range of 38 - 197 hours), confirming half-life extension. Half-life, clearance rate, and volume of distribution were dose-independent, suggesting linear PK kinetics. Pharmacodynamic analysis shows a dose-dependent, transient increase in serum cytokines and chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF\u03b1).\nIn January 2021, HPN217 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of multiple myeloma. In March 2022, HPN217 received fast track designation for the treatment of relapsed, refractory multiple myeloma. We intend to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose for an expansion phase in the first half of 2022.\nHPN217 is covered by a global development and option agreement with AbbVie Inc., or AbbVie, and treatment of the first patient in the clinical trial triggered a $50 million milestone payment, which we received in June 2020. HPN217 targets B-cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, a well-validated target expressed on multiple myeloma cells. Harpoon is responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, and we are actively enrolling patients in the dose escalation portion of the multi-country trial. Under the agreement with AbbVie, we are eligible to receive future payments totaling up to $430 million upon AbbVie's exercise of an exclusive license option and achievement of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, in addition to royalties on commercial sales.\nHPN536\nHPN536 is a MSLN-targeting T cell engager, and we are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for ovarian, pancreatic and other MSLN-expressing solid tumors. The study is collecting data to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and activity of HPN536. In December 2021, we provided a clinical update on our ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial, at the time of the December 2, 2021 data cutoff, dosing had occurred across 9 fixed-dose cohorts of 6 to 280ng/kg and 3 step dose cohort up to 1200ng/kg. Tumor types treated included late-stage ovarian and pancreatic cancers and mesothelioma.\nAs of December 2, 2021, HPN536 appears to be well tolerated. One CRS grade 3 occurred in the absence of dexamethasone premedication treatment. The CRS resolved, and the patient continued on study with dexamethasone premedication. As of the December 2, 2021 data cutoff date, no new DLTs had been observed other than the two previously noted from May 31, 2021 data cutoff. An MTD has not been identified and escalation to higher doses is underway. We recently opened and are actively recruiting a 7200 ng/kg cohort.\nHPN424\nIn March 2022, we announced the discontinuation of further clinical development for HPN424, our PSMA-targeting TriTAC. We intend to wind down the clinical study for the remainder of calendar year 2022, while ensuring that patients on study have access to HPN424 for their course of therapy.\nProTriTAC\nIn May 2020, as a part of our pipeline update, we also presented advancements in our second platform, ProTriTAC, which was designed to expand the universe of addressable targets and indications for T cell engagers. We have nominated the first ProTriTAC clinical candidate, HPN601, with Investigational New Drug application, or IND, enabling studies underway, and we expect to provide additional development updates later this year. Our ProTriTAC platform applies a prodrug concept to create a therapeutic T cell engager that remains inactive until it reaches the tumor. ProTriTACs therefore have the potential for additional tumor specificity and enhanced safety profiles because they are designed to have limited interaction with their molecular targets in healthy tissue, allowing us to target tumor-associated antigens that may be more broadly expressed. When a ProTriTAC penetrates a tumor, tumor-associated proteases cleave off the blocking domain of the ProTriTAC, thereby enabling the engagement of T cells to subsequently kill tumor cells. This activation process also diminishes the half-life of the resulting T cell engager. If active molecules leave the tumor tissue, they are rapidly eliminated from the body, therefore further limiting the potential side effects in normal tissues.\nHPN601\nOur first ProTriTAC candidate is currently in preclinical development. HPN601 targets EPCAM, which is expressed on variety of solid tumors. Our initial focus is expected to be in gastrointestinal cancers. We plan to submit an IND for HPN601 as well as identify a second IND candidate from the ProTriTAC platform by the end of 2022.\nTriTAC-XR\nIn November 2021, we presented preclinical data on TriTAC-XR at the 35th Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, annual meeting. The poster presentation demonstrated the efficacy of the platform in vitro and in rodent models, and showed in non-human-primates that TriTAC-XR can produce PD effects similar to a TriTAC with significantly lower cytokine release than a comparable TriTAC. We plan to nominate an IND candidate from the TriTAC-XR platform by the end of 2022.\nBusiness Operations\nSince commencing operations in 2015, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to performing research and development and manufacturing activities in support of our product development efforts, hiring personnel, raising capital to support and expand such activities and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations to date primarily from proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes, the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants, the sale of common stock, and payments received under our discovery collaboration agreement with AbbVie.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant net operating losses. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our current or future product candidates and programs. Our net losses were $116.7 million, $49.9 million and $55.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.8 million. Our primary use of cash is to fund net losses, operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development expenditures, and to a lesser extent, general and administrative expenditures. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect our research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures will continue to increase.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials and expenditures on other research and development activities. We expect our expenses will increase substantially over time as we:\n\u2022continue the research and development of HPN328, HPN217, HPN536, and HPN601 as well as our other product candidates;\n\u2022initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u2022seek marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n\u2022continue to invest in our technology platforms, including TriTAC, ProTriTAC and TriTAC-XR;\n\u2022maintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022implement operational, financial and management systems; and\n\u2022attract, hire and retain additional administrative, clinical, regulatory and scientific personnel.\nFurthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company.\nIn January 2021, we closed a follow on public offering of 6,764,704 shares of our common stock, including 882,352 shares sold pursuant to the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares at $17.00 per share. The net proceeds to us were approximately $107.6 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs payable by us.\nFrom January 2021 through December 31, 2021, pursuant to our Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald, we received an aggregate of approximately $2.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or mitigate its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. Our assessment to date continues to support that we have not experienced any material delays or significant financial impacts directly related to the pandemic other than some minor disruptions to clinical operations, including some disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain that affected and may continue to affect our drug supply, patient enrollment in some of our clinical trials and delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at our clinical trial sites. We will continue to monitor the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, liquidity, assets and operations, including our personnel, programs, expected timelines, expenses, third-party contract manufacturing, contract research organizations and clinical trials.\nWhile we are currently continuing our clinical trials we have underway in sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials, as a result of potential delays or difficulties in enrolling or assessing patients in our clinical trials, clinical site initiation, diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, interruption of key clinical trial activities, disruptions in our manufacturing supply chain, among other factors. While our third-party contract manufacturers have been operating at or near normal levels and while have not experienced any major interruptions to our contract manufacturers' processes, it is possible that the pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party contract manufacturers' ability to produce quantities of our product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the pandemic. Certain of our clinical trial sites have experienced, and others may experience in the future, delays in collecting, receiving and analyzing data from patients enrolled in our clinical trials for due to limited staff at such sites, limitation or suspension of on-site visits by patients, or patients' reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. We and our contract research organizations may also need to make certain adjustments to the operation of our clinical trials in an effort to ensure the monitoring and safety of patients and minimize risk to trial integrity during the pandemic and generally. We could also see an impact on our ability to interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority, personnel resources or otherwise.\nIn addition, in response to the ongoing spread of COVID-19, we have established testing protocols for personnel access to our headquarter offices and laboratory. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business, assets, operations and clinical trials, particularly if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and persists for an extended period of time. See Risk factors-Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing in many parts of the world and may result in significant disruptions which could materially affect our operations, including at our headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area and at our clinical trial sites.\u201d for more information regarding the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations. We continue to actively monitor this situation and the possible effects on our business and operations.\nCollaborations with AbbVie\nDevelopment and Option Agreement\nOn November 20, 2019, we entered into a Development and Option Agreement, which we refer to, as amended, as the Development and Option Agreement, with AbbVie in connection with our HPN217 program, which targets B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA. Pursuant to such agreement, we granted to AbbVie an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to our patents and know-how applicable to the HPN217 program to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products arising from the HPN217 program and targeting BCMA, or HPN217 Products. Under the Development and Option Agreement, we filed an IND for HPN217 and are responsible for conducting clinical development activities pursuant to a mutually agreed upon development plan, including conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217, in order for AbbVie to determine whether it wishes to exercise its option to a worldwide, exclusive license to such HPN217 program. We initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in April 2020.\nUnder the Development and Option Agreement, AbbVie may exercise its license option at any time during a period commencing on the effective date of the agreement and expiring after a specified period following delivery by us of a specified data package arising from the first Phase 1/2 trial for the HPN217 Products. Following AbbVie's exercise of its option, and except for completion of certain development activities by us under the development plan, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of HPN217 and any other HPN217 Products. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval for one HPN217 Product, for at least one indication, for use in each Major Market (as defined in the Development and Option Agreement).\nAbbVie paid an upfront payment of $30.0 million and, in June 2020, a development milestone payment of $50.0 million, as we dosed our first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217 in April 2020. If AbbVie exercises its option, AbbVie will pay us an option exercise fee of $200.0 million. Following option exercise, AbbVie will be required to make further payments to us of up to $230.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for HPN217 Products. We will also receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of HPN217 Products at percentages ranging from the high single digits to the very low double digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Development and Option Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of HPN217 and other HPN217 Products, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or ten years following first commercial sale of such HPN217 Product in such country.\nWe will recognize revenue under the Development and Option Agreement as the initial development activities are performed using an input method, according to the costs incurred as related to the estimated costs for the development and regulatory activities to be performed through the completion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of HPN217. Accordingly, of the $30.0 million upfront payment received in 2019 and $50.0 million development milestone received in 2020, $18.4 million and $13.8 million of revenue was recognized for the year ended 2021 and 2020, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $46.1 million of deferred revenue under the Development and Option Agreement.\nAmended and Restated Discovery Collaboration Agreement\nOn August 16, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or the First Amendment, with AbbVie, which amends the Amended and Restated Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement, or, as amended by the First Amendment, the Restated Collaboration Agreement, entered on November 20, 2019, between us and AbbVie, which agreement amends and restates the Discovery Collaboration and License Agreement entered into between us and AbbVie, dated October 20, 2017 and amended April 3, 2019, or the Original Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, we and AbbVie agreed to include the ProTriTAC technology within the Restated Collaboration Agreement. Pursuant to the Original Collaboration Agreement, we granted to AbbVie worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products that incorporate our proprietary TriTAC technology together with soluble TCRs provided by AbbVie that bind to targets accepted by the parties. Under the terms of the Original Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie was granted the right to designate up to two targets for development of TriTAC constructs, which it selected in 2017 and 2019, respectively. Pursuant to the Restated Collaboration Agreement, AbbVie is permitted to designate two further targets, with an option to select up to four additional targets, selected during a specified period following the effective date, to be the subject of activities under the collaboration, and is granted a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize products that incorporate either our proprietary TriTAC platform technology, or (as a result of and pursuant to the First Amendment) our ProTriTAC platform technology, together with soluble T cell receptors, or TCRs. Such products may incorporate antibodies provided by AbbVie or by us. During a period of up to four years following the date of AbbVie's designation of each target for the products, and subject to confirmation of target availability, we and AbbVie will conduct certain research and discovery activities under a mutually agreed discovery and research plan in connection with the creation and evaluation of constructs comprising our proprietary TriTAC or ProTriTAC technologies, in conjunction with the soluble TCR or antibody sequences directed at the agreed upon targets of interest. We may not, including through any third party, develop or commercialize any competing product that binds to any of the included targets. As was the case under the Original Collaboration Agreement, following the discovery phase, AbbVie will be solely responsible, at its cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of the products that arise from the activities under the discovery plan. AbbVie is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one such product directed to each target for which the discovery activities were completed in each Major Market (as defined in the Restated Collaboration Agreement).\nIn addition to the upfront payment of $17.0 million already paid under the Original Collaboration Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $20.0 million under the Restated Collaboration Agreement for AbbVie's right to select two further targets and an option to select up to four further targets. AbbVie will be required to make payments to us, upon target selection, of $10.0 million for each target, for up to four additional targets selected by AbbVie. For each of the up to eight targets selected, we are eligible to receive up to $300.0 million in the aggregate for the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial sales milestones for licensed products indicated for human therapeutic or prophylactic use. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales by AbbVie, its affiliates and sublicensees of licensed products at percentages in the mid-single digits, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable under the Restated Collaboration Agreement on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis commencing on the date of first commercial sale of each product, and ending on the later of expiration of all valid claims of specified licensed patents in such country, expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country or ten years following first commercial sale of such product in such country. If licensed products are developed and commercialized for diagnostic or veterinary use, or certain screening or monitoring uses, the parties have agreed to negotiate an appropriate reduction in the economic terms applicable to such non-therapeutic and prophylactic applications.\nWe recognized revenue under the Original Collaboration Agreement over a period in which related research and development activities occur. Accordingly, of the $17.0 million upfront payment received in 2017, $4.3 million and $3.7 million of revenue was recognized during the years ended 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we recognized the full $17.0 million upfront payment related to the initial two targets.\nWe will recognize revenue under the Restated Collaboration Agreement over a period in which related research and development activities occur. Accordingly, of the $20.0 million upfront payment received in 2019, $0.9 million and zero of revenue was recognized for the year ended 2021 and 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had $19.1 million of deferred revenue under the Restated Collaboration Agreement.\nThe Restated Collaboration Agreement will terminate upon the date of the expiration of all AbbVie's royalty payment obligations in all countries. The Restated Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by either party immediately for the insolvency of the other party or on 90 days' written notice for an uncured material breach of such agreement by the other party. AbbVie may also terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement in its entirety or on a target-by-target or country-by-country basis for any reason on 30 days' written notice to the Company. In addition, AbbVie may terminate the Restated Collaboration Agreement immediately in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis if AbbVie considers in good faith that there has been a failure of the discovery or development efforts with respect to such target, or that further development or commercialization of products directed to such target is not advisable as a result of a serious safety issue.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nWe have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our collaboration and license revenue to date is related to work performed by us under the Restated Collaboration Agreement and Development and Option Agreement, and is recognized when designated research and development services are performed. To date, we have not received any milestone or royalty payments under the Original Collaboration Agreement or the Restated Collaboration Agreement. We expect that any collaboration and license revenue we generate from the Restated Collaboration Agreement and the Development and Option Agreement and any future collaboration partners will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing and amount of milestones and other payments. Additionally, for research and development services that we recognize over time, we measure our progress using an input method. The input methods we use are based on the effort we expend or costs we incur toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. We estimate the amount of effort we expend, including the time we estimate it will take us to complete the activities, or costs we incur in a given period, relative to the estimated total effort or costs to satisfy the performance obligation. This results in a percentage that we multiply by the transaction price to determine the amount of revenue we recognize each period. This approach requires us to make numerous estimates and use significant judgement. If our estimates or judgements change over the course of the collaboration, they may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize in the current and future periods.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses represent costs incurred in performing research, development and manufacturing activities in support of our own product development efforts and those of our collaborators, and include salaries, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, laboratory supplies, outsourced research and development expenses, professional services and allocated facilities-related costs. We expense both internal and external research and development expenses as they are incurred. We do not allocate our costs by product candidates, as our research and development expenses include internal costs, such as payroll and other personnel expenses, and external costs, neither of which are tracked by product candidate. In particular, with respect to internal costs, several of our departments support multiple product candidate research and development programs. Non-refundable advance payments for services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses and recognized as expenses as the related services are performed.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates into and through preclinical studies and clinical trials, pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates and expand our pipeline of product candidates.
