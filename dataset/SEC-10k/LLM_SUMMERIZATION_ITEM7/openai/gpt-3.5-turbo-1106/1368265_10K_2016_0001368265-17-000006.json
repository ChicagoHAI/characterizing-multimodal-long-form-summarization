We refer to these joint ventures as the RNG Ventures.\u201d Renewables and Aria each have a 50% ownership interest in the RNG Ventures and, subject to certain conditions, are each responsible for 50% of the costs of developing the RNG production facilities that are owned by the RNG Ventures. We also have the exclusive right to purchase 100% of the RNG that will be produced by these facilities for the vehicle fuels market. As of December 31, 2016, we have an investment balance of $0.8 million in the RNG Ventures. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.\nOn February 27, 2017, Renewables entered into an asset purchase agreement (the APA\u201d) with BP Products North America, Inc. ( BP\u201d), pursuant to which Renewables agreed to sell to BP certain assets relating to its RNG production business, including our two existing RNG production facilities and our interest in the RNG Ventures (collectively, the RNG Assets\u201d), in exchange for $155.0 million in cash and the right to receive up to an additional $25.0 million in cash over a five-year period if certain performance criteria relating to the RNG Assets are met (the Asset Sale\u201d). In addition, we will collect royalties on gas purchased from BP and sold as Redeem at our stations. This royalty payment is in addition to any payment obligation of BP under the APA. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of required government and third-party consents and approvals, the Asset Sale is expected to close on or before March 31, 2017. At the closing of the Asset Sale, BP will pay $30.0 million of the closing purchase price in cash and deliver to us a promissory note for $125.0 million to be paid on April 3, 2017. Following completion of the Asset Sale we will continue to obtain RNG from third-party producers, including RNG produced from the production facilities to be sold in the Asset Sale and sold to us by BP under a long-term supply contract, and resell such RNG through our natural gas fueling infrastructure as Redeem\u2122, our RNG vehicle fuel.\nDebt Arrangements. On February 29, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with, and issued a related promissory note to, PlainsCapital Bank (\"Plains\"), pursuant to which Plains agreed to lend us up to $50.0 million on a revolving basis for a term of one year (the \"Credit Facility\"). Simultaneously, we drew down $50.0 million under the Credit Facility, which we repaid in full on August 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the Credit Facility's maturity date was extended from February 28, 2017 to September 30, 2018. On December 22, 2016 we drew down $23.5 million under the Credit Facility, which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nOn March 1, 2016 and pursuant to the consent of the holders of our outstanding 7.5% convertible promissory notes due in August 2016 (the \"SLG Notes\"), we prepaid in cash an aggregate of $60.0 million in principal amount and $1.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest owed under the SLG Notes. Additionally, on July 14, 2016, we entered into separate privately negotiated exchange agreements with each holder of an SLG Note to exchange the outstanding principal amount of each SLG Note, totaling $85.0 million for all SLG Notes, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, totaling $0.2 million for all SLG Notes, for an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of our common stock and $38.2 million in cash. We recognized a loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the settlement of the SLG Notes. The repurchased and exchanged SLG Notes have been surrendered and canceled in full and we have no further obligations under the SLG Notes.\nIn 2016, our board of directors authorized and approved our purchase of our outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"5.25% Notes\") in the open market, in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% Notes. Pursuant to this approval, in 2016, we paid an aggregate of $84.3 million in cash to repurchase and retire $114.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Additionally, pursuant to a privately negotiated exchange agreement with certain holders of the 5.25% Notes, on May 4, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 6,265,829 shares of our common stock in exchange for an aggregate principal amount of $25 million of 5.25% Notes held by such holders, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Our repurchase and exchange of 5.25% Notes in 2016 resulted in a total gain of $35.2 million recorded during the period. All repurchased and exchanged 5.25% Notes have been surrendered to the trustee for such notes and canceled in full and we have no further obligations under such notes.\nIn February 2017, we purchased from one of our directors and significant stockholders, T. Boone Pickens, the 7.5% Convertible Note due July 2018 having an outstanding principal amount of $25.0 million held by Mr. Pickens for a cash purchase price of $21.75 million.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about our debt.\nATM Program. On November 11, 2015, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citigroup\"), as sales agent and/or principal, to commence an \"at-the-market\" offering program (the \"ATM Program\"). Initially, we were permitted to issue and sell, from time to time, through or to Citigroup, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million in the ATM Program. On September 9, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated equity distribution agreement with Citigroup for the primary purpose of increasing, from $75.0 million to $110.0 million, the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program. On December 21, 2016, we entered into a second amended and restated equity distribution agreement with Citigroup for the primary purpose of increasing, from $110.0 million to $200.0 million, the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program.\nVETC Expiration. On December 31, 2016, the VETC alternative fuels tax credit expired and ceased to be available, and it may not be available in any subsequent period. Under VETC, we were eligible to receive credits of $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per liquid gallon of LNG that we sold as a vehicle fuel through December 31, 2015, and $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per diesel gallon equivalent of LNG that we sold as a vehicle fuel from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through operating cash flows, the sale or maturity of investments or other assets or the acquisition of additional funds through capital management or capital-raising transactions. Our liquidity is, and will continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors, including the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the principal and interest we are obligated to pay on our indebtedness, our capital expenditure requirements and any merger, divestiture or acquisition activity, as well as our ability to generate cash flows from our operations or from other sources. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for additional information.\nDebt Level and Debt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $314.3 million in principal amount, of which approximately $6.1 million is expected to become due in 2017. Certain of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, which are discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, have certain non-financial covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.\nBusiness Risks and Uncertainties\nOur business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.\nKey Trends\nRecent Trends\nMarket for Natural Gas. CNG and LNG are generally less expensive than gasoline and diesel on an energy equivalent basis and, according to studies conducted by the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") and Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, cleaner than gasoline and diesel fuel. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for natural gas fuels in the United States has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase. We believe the growth in demand in recent years is attributable primarily\nto the higher prices of gasoline and diesel relative to CNG and LNG during much of this period, increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets and increased supply of natural gas.\nIn the recent past, however, the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas have been significantly lower and volatile, and these trends of lower prices and volatility may continue. Additionally, in spite of growth in demand in recent years, there are significant uncertainties affecting the current market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, including growing favor among lawmakers, regulators, other policy makers and other powerful industry participants for other alternative fuels or vehicles, including electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, and uncertainties regarding the availability and effect on our business of environmental and other regulations, programs or incentives that promote cleaner vehicle fuels, particularly in light of the results of the recent U.S. presidential election. These conditions have resulted in lower revenue levels in certain periods due in large part to a decreased pricing advantage when comparing natural gas prices to diesel and gasoline prices, which we believe has decreased overall demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, and reduced the prices we have been charging our customers for CNG and LNG, which have reduced our profit margins. To the extent these volatile and lower-pricing conditions and other uncertainties persist, our financial results may continue to be adversely affected.\nOur Performance. Our gross revenue is mostly comprised of volume related revenue, compressor and other equipment sales, station construction sales, and VETC revenue. Our revenue can vary between periods due to a variety of factors, including natural gas prices and sale activity, fluctuations in commodity costs and the amount and timing of recognition of government credits, sales of RINs and LCFS credits, compressor and other equipment sales and station construction sales. Our volume-related revenue, which is further discussed below, increased from 2014 to 2016, due largely to the increase in gallons we delivered, and sales of tradable credits in 2015 and 2016.\nOur cost of sales can also vary between periods due to a variety of factors, including the factors described above.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for a further discussion of our performance.\nVolume-Related Revenue. The amount of CNG, LNG and RNG GGEs we delivered increased by 24.1% from 2014 to 2016.\nThe RNG we sell for vehicle fuel, which is delivered in the form of CNG or LNG is distributed under the name Redeem\u2122. The amount of Redeem vehicle fuel we delivered increased from 20.2 million GGEs in 2014 to 58.6 million GGEs in 2016, a 190.1% increase. We believe this demand for Redeem\u2122 is largely attributable to the lower greenhouse gas emissions that it produces relative to gasoline and diesel.\nOur sales of increasing volumes of CNG, LNG and RNG for use as a vehicle fuel has resulted in our generation of increasing amounts of RINs and LCFS Credits which, together with the increasing prices for RINs and LCFS Credits, has resulted in increased revenue associated with these credits.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue from RINs and LCFS Credits:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIN Credits\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LCFS Credits\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we expect to continue to generate revenue relating to the sale of RINs and LCFS Credits from our continued sales of our Redeem RNG vehicle fuel, the amount of revenue we would receive from the sale of such credits will decrease if the existing RNG Assets are sold in the Asset Sale as planned, which would adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our effective price per gallon in future periods as compared to 2016. Completion of the Asset Sale will, however, improve our liquidity. Further, the markets for RINs and LCFS Credits have historically been volatile, and the prices for these credits have been subject to significant fluctuations. Additionally, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits may be adversely affected by any changes to the federal and state programs under which such credits are generated and sold. For example, CARB recently raised the carbon intensity rating of the RNG we sell in California, which will reduce the amount of LCFS Credits we generate.\nOur Stations. The number of fueling stations we owned, operated, maintained and/or supplied increased from over 470 as of January 1, 2014 to over 570 as of December 31, 2016 (a 21.3% increase). Included in this number are all of the CNG and LNG fueling stations we own, operate, maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract.\nWe have made a significant commitment of capital and other resources to build a nationwide network of natural gas truck friendly fueling stations, which we refer to as \"America's Natural Gas Highway\" or \"ANGH.\" At December 31, 2016, we had 39 completed ANGH stations that were not open for fueling operations. We expect to open these stations when we have sufficient customers to fuel at the locations, but we do not know when this will occur. We believe that growth in the heavy-duty truck customers depends, in part, on the adoption of natural gas engines that are well-suited for heavy-duty trucks, which has been slower and more limited than anticipated. If heavy-duty trucking customers do not develop and if we do not open these stations, we will continue to have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenue.\nAnticipated Future Trends.\nAlthough natural gas continues to be less expensive than gasoline and diesel in most markets, the price of natural gas has been significantly closer to the prices of gasoline and diesel in recent years as a result of lower oil prices, thereby reducing the price advantage of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. We anticipate that, over the long term, the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and will increase overall, which would improve the cost savings of natural gas compared to gasoline and diesel. It is uncertain, however, whether the prices for gasoline and diesel will increase from their current levels, and we expect that adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and growth in our customer base and revenue will be negatively affected while oil and diesel prices remain low. Our belief that natural gas will continue, over the long term, to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in recent years of natural gas production in the United States, as well as increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets, which we believe drives the market for alternative fuels generally.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for natural gas fuels in the United States is expected to increase. We believe natural gas fuels are well-suited for use by vehicle fleets that consume high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are increasingly required to reduce emissions. As a result, we believe there will be growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets, and our goal is to capitalize on this trend, if and when it materializes, and to enhance our leadership position in these markets. Our business plan calls for expanding our sales of natural gas vehicle fuel in the markets in which we operate, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, government fleets and industrial and institutional energy users, and pursuing additional markets as opportunities arise. Additionally, we expect that the lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with our Redeem vehicle fuel will result in continued increased demand for this fuel, resulting in our delivery of increasing volumes of Redeem to our vehicle fleet customers. If these projections materialize and our business grows as we anticipate, then our operating costs and capital expenditures may increase, primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network, additional investments in ANGH stations to add CNG fueling, purchases of additional CNG trailers by NG Advantage, and increased RNG production, as well as the logistics of delivering more natural gas fuel to our customers. We also may seek to acquire assets and/or businesses that are in the natural gas fueling infrastructure, which may require us to spend additional capital.\nAlthough we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel to remain steady in the near-term, we expect competition in the alternative fuels market generally to increase. Any such increased competition would lead to amplified pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities.\nRisk Management Activities\nFrom time to time, we enter into natural gas fuel sales contracts that require us to sell CNG or LNG to our customers at a fixed price. These contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell the natural gas to our customers.\nIn an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to any futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to our fixed price sales contracts, we operate under a natural gas hedging policy pursuant to which we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid. Subject to the conditions set forth in the policy, we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to effectively hedge our exposure to cash flow variability related to fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy. Unless otherwise agreed in advance by our board of directors and the derivatives committee thereof, we will conduct our futures contract activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy.\nDue to the restrictions of our hedging policy, we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers. If we do offer a fixed price sales contract, we anticipate including a price component that would cover our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts. The amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contract.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenue on various products and services.\nOur volume related revenue primarily consists of CNG, LNG and RNG fuel sales, RINs and LCFS Credits sales and O&M services. This revenue is recognized in accordance with US GAAP, which requires that the following four criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nApplying the factors above, we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas fuel at the time the fuel is dispensed or, in the case of LNG sales agreements, delivered to our customers' storage facilities. We generate LCFS Credits when we sell RNG and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon and we generate RIN Credits when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel. We can sell these credits to third parties who need the RINs and LCFS Credits to comply with federal and state emission requirements. We recognize revenue from the generation of these credits when we have an agreement in place to sell the credits at a fixed or determinable price. We recognize revenue from O&M service agreements as we provide the related services.\nWe recognize compression revenue through our subsidiary Clean Energy Compression when it sells non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment. Clean Energy Compression uses the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize revenue because its projects are small and it has been able to demonstrate that it can reasonably estimate costs to complete. In these circumstances, revenue is recognized based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs to be incurred for a project.\nBeginning January 1, 2016, we began using the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue for station construction projects using the cost-to-cost method. Under this method, we estimate the percentage of completion of a project based on the costs incurred to date for the associated contract in comparison to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Historically, we recognized revenue on station construction projects using the completed-contract method because we did not have a reliable means to make estimates of the percentage of the contract completed. Under the completed contract method, the construction projects were considered substantially complete at the earlier of customer acceptance of the fueling station or the time when fuel dispensing activities at the station began. The sale of compressors and related equipment continues to be recognized under the percentage of completion method as in previous periods. Effective January 1, 2016, we implemented a cost tracking system that provides for a detailed tracking of costs incurred on its station construction projects on a project by project basis. We also changed related accounting activities and processes to timely identify and monitor costs. As a result of this implementation, we are able to make reliable estimates as to the percentage of a project that is complete at the end of each reporting period.\nStation construction contracts are generally short-term, except for certain larger and more complex stations, which can take up to 24 months to complete. Management evaluates the performance of contracts on an individual contract basis. Contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the reporting period when such estimates are revised.\nThe nature of accounting for contracts is such that refinements of estimates to account for changing conditions and new developments are continuous and characteristic of the process. Many factors that can affect contract profitability may change during the performance period of a contract, including differing site conditions, the availability of skilled contract labor, the\nperformance of major suppliers and subcontractors, and unexpected changes in material costs. Changes to these factors may result in revisions to costs and income, which are recognized in the period in which the revisions become known. Provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses become known. During the year ended December 31, 2016, there were no significant losses on open contracts.\nWe consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which the customer has approved the change of scope but an agreement has not been reached as to an associated price change. Change orders that are unapproved as to both price and scope are evaluated as claims. Claims have historically been insignificant. There were no significant unapproved change orders, claims, contract penalties, settlements or changes in contract estimates during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn certain transactions with our customers, we agree to provide multiple products or services, including construction of and sale of a station, providing O&M services to the station, and sale of fuel to the customer. We evaluate the separability of revenues based on Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") authoritative guidance, which provides a framework for establishing whether or not a particular arrangement with a customer has one or more revenue elements and allows us to use a combination of internal and external objective and reliable evidence to develop management's best estimate of the fair value of the contract elements. If the arrangement contains a lease, we use the existing evidence of fair value to separate the lease from the other elements in the arrangement. The arrangement's consideration that is fixed or determinable is then allocated to each separate unit of accounting based on the estimated relative selling price of each deliverable, which is determined based on the historical data derived from our stand-alone projects. The revenue allocated to the construction of the station is recognized using the completed-contract method. The revenue allocated to the O&M is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement and sale of fuel is recognized as the fuel is delivered.\nWe recognize revenue received from the VETC alternative fuels tax credit. Based on the service relationship with our customers, either we or our customers claim the credit. We record our VETC credits, if any, as revenue in our consolidated statements of operations, as the credits are fully payable and do not need to offset income tax liabilities to be received. As such, the credits are not deemed income tax credits under the accounting guidance applicable to income taxes.\nWe collect and remit taxes assessed by various governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions between us and our customers. These taxes may include, among others, fuel, sales and value-added taxes. We report the collection of these taxes on a net basis.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess of costs incurred over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess our goodwill using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. The qualitative assessment includes the potential impact on a reporting unit's fair value of certain events and circumstances, including our market capitalization value, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and other relevant entity-specific events. If it is determined, based upon the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, then a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. We perform the impairment test annually as of October 1, or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review.\nWe are required to use judgment when applying the goodwill impairment test, including, among other considerations, the identification of reporting units and the assessment of qualitative factors involved in the test. Applying this judgment, we have determined that we are a single reporting unit and, based upon our qualitative assessment of goodwill, we have concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount and no further quantitative analysis was warranted. During 2014, 2015 and 2016, there were no indicators of impairment to goodwill. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, our stock price has declined due to adverse macroeconomic conditions surrounding the energy industry, which are driven in part by depressed oil prices. As a result of the recent volatility of our market capitalization, it is possible that our goodwill could become impaired, which could result in a material charge and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe review long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Estimated future cash flows are determined by management based on a number of estimates, including future cash flow projections, discount rates and terminal values. In determining these estimates, management considers internally generated information and information obtained from market participants. The determination of fair value requires significant judgment by management. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we determined that a long-lived asset related to a contract acquired in our acquisition of the business of Clean Energy Compression was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of $4.8 million. There were no impairments of our long-lived assets during 2015 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes.\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the tax bases and financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities. The impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws, if any, are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the need for a valuation analysis, we use estimates involving a high degree of judgment including projected future US GAAP income and the amounts and estimated timing of the reversal of any deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe have a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense.\nWe operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. Although we believe that adequate consideration has been given to these issues, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these issues could be significantly different than originally estimated.\nFair Value Measurements.\nWe have established a framework that follows the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and non-recurring basis. Under the framework, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, as of the measurement date. The framework also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of our Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy consists of the following three levels: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nOur significant uses of fair value measurements include the allocation of the purchase price paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in those acquisitions, which requires significant judgment.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Changes and Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards.\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe table below presents our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue and the narrative that follows provides a detailed discussion of certain line items for the years presented.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue\n</td> <td>85.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product cost of sales\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost of sales\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from change in fair value of derivative warrants\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(24.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from equity method investments\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from extinguishment of debt, net\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from sale of subsidiary\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(34.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>(35.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp.\n</td> <td>(34.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Revenue increased by $18.4 million to $402.7 million for 2016, from $384.3 million for 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes, including higher RINs and LCFS Credits sales, and increased station construction sales, partially offset by lower VETC revenue and compressor sales.\nVolume related revenue increased by $23.3 million between periods primarily due to an increase of 20.5 million gallons delivered, which provided approximately $17.7 million of increased revenue. This increase in gallons delivered was due to a 30.0 million gallon increase in CNG gallons delivered, which was primarily attributable to 16 new refuse customers, six new transit customers and two new trucking customers, partially offset by a 5.8 million decrease in RNG gallons delivered for non-vehicle fuel and a 3.7 million decrease in LNG gallons delivered. Additionally, approximately $5.5 million of the increase in volume related revenue was the result of an increase in the effective price charged per gallon delivered. Our effective price per gallon charged was $0.86 for 2016, a $0.02 per gallon increase from $0.84 per gallon charged for 2015. The increase in our effective price charged was primarily due to increases of $18.7 million and $11.9 million in revenue from sales of RINs and LCFS Credits, respectively, which do not result in increased costs, partially offset by a decline in the effective price per gallon charged of approximately $0.08 per gallon caused primarily by lower retail prices driven by lower commodity costs. The effective price per gallon is defined as revenue generated from selling CNG, LNG, RNG and any related RINs and LCFS Credits and providing O&M services to our vehicle fleet customers at stations that we do not own and for which we receive a per-gallon or fixed fee, all divided by the total GGEs delivered less GGEs delivered by non-consolidated entities, such as entities that are accounted for under the equity method.\nStation construction sales increased by $27.1 million between periods, principally from the sale of more full station projects than station upgrades in the 2016 period, as full station projects generally have substantially higher price points than station upgrades.\nThese revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in Clean Energy Compression's revenue of $27.2 million between periods due to lower compressor sales, which we believe is a result of a lower global demand for compressors.\nVETC revenue decreased by $4.4 million between periods, primarily due to the VETC credit being changed for 2016 to be based on the diesel gallon equivalent of LNG sold rather than the liquid gallon of LNG sold. See -Overview-Recent Developments-VETC Expiration\u201d above for additional information.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales decreased by $2.9 million to $255.6 million for 2016, from $258.5 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a $24.1 million decrease in compressor costs between periods, as a result of decreased compressor sales and a $3.5 million decrease in gas commodity costs between periods as a result of a decrease in natural gas prices (discussed below). These decreases were partially offset by a $24.7 million increase in costs related to increased station construction sales between periods.\nOur effective cost per gallon decreased by $0.04 per gallon between periods, to $0.52 per gallon for 2016, from $0.56 for 2015. Our effective cost per gallon is defined as the total costs associated with delivering natural gas, including gas commodity costs, transportation fees, liquefaction charges, and other site operating costs, plus the total cost of providing O&M services at stations that we do not own and for which we receive a per-gallon or fixed fee, including direct technician labor, indirect supervisor and management labor, repair parts and other direct maintenance costs, all divided by the total GGEs delivered less GGEs delivered by non-consolidated entities, such as entities that are accounted for under the equity method. The decrease in our effective cost per gallon was primarily due to a decrease in natural gas prices between periods. The decrease in natural gas prices partially offset by the increase in gallons delivered resulted in a net decrease of $3.5 million in gas commodity costs between periods.\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $8.2 million to $105.5 million for 2016, from $113.7 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by a $4.9 million decrease in employee-related expenses between periods and a $3.8 million decrease in travel and promotional expenses between periods. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in research and development costs between periods.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $4.1 million to $59.3 million for 2016, from $55.2 million for 2015, due to purchases of property and equipment, primarily for our stations.\nGain from extinguishment of debt, net. Gain from extinguishment of debt, net was $34.3 million for 2016 as a result of repurchasing and retiring $284.6 million in principal amount of our 5.25% Notes and SLG Notes, together with $3.6 million accrued and unpaid interest thereon, for an aggregate purchase price of $185.9 million in cash and 20.3 million shares of our common stock. See Note 10 for further information.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased by $66.2 million to $29.6 million for 2016, from $95.8 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a non-cash charge of $54.9 million in 2015 related to the elimination of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our termination of our former credit agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (\"GE\"), as well as our reduction of outstanding indebtedness in 2016. See Overview-Recent Developments-Debt Arrangements\u201d and Note 10 for further information.\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, decreased by $(2.9) million to $(0.3) million for 2016, from $2.6 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in the loss from foreign currency transactions not in our subsidiaries' functional currency, a decrease of $0.5 million between periods as result of a litigation settlement in 2015 and a $1.6 million decrease due to a $0.9 million gain from asset disposals in 2015 compared to $0.7 million in losses from asset disposals in 2016.\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense decreased by $0.3 million to $1.3 million for 2016, from $1.6 million for 2015. The decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in our tax on foreign operations between periods.\nLoss from noncontrolling interest. In 2016, we recorded a $1.6 million loss for the noncontrolling interest in the net loss of NG Advantage LLC (\"NG Advantage\"), compared to a $1.2 million loss for 2015. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information. The noncontrolling interest in NG Advantage represents a 46.7% interest, which was held by third parties during the applicable periods.\nFiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe table below presents our results of operations as a percentage of total revenue and the narrative that follows provides a detailed discussion of certain line items for the years presented.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenues\n</td> <td>88.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenues\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product cost of sales\n</td> <td>67.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service cost of sales\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from change in fair value of derivative warrants\n</td> <td>(1.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of long-lived asset\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>112.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>110.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from equity method investments\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from sale of subsidiary\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>(21.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from noncontrolling interest\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to Clean Energy Fuels Corp.\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Revenue decreased by $44.6 million to $384.3 million for 2015 from $428.9 million for 2014 due to lower effective pricing and fewer station construction and compressor sales. Revenue for station construction sales decreased by $29.6 million principally from the sale of more station upgrades and fewer full station projects in 2015. Full station projects generally have substantially higher price points than station upgrades. Clean Energy Compression revenue decreased by $30.3 million due to the effects of a continued global decline in oil prices, the strength of the U.S. dollar and slower than expected sales in China. Approximately $24.3 million of the decrease in revenue was the result of lower effective prices of gallons delivered, which were caused by lower commodity costs in 2015 compared to 2014. Our effective price per gallon charged was $0.84 for 2015, a $0.10 per gallon decrease from $0.94 per gallon charged for 2014. The decrease in our effective price was due to lower fuel prices driven by lower commodity costs, partially offset by increased RINs and LCFS credits sales of $8.2 and $4.6 million, respectively. The effective price per gallon is defined as revenues generated from selling CNG, LNG, RNG, any related RINs and LCFS Credits sales and providing O&M services to our vehicle fleet customers at stations that we do not own and for which we receive a per-gallon fee, all divided by the total GGEs delivered less GGEs delivered by non-consolidated entities, such as equity method investments.\nThe decrease in revenue was partially offset by a 43.4 million increase in the number of gallons delivered, from 265.1 million gallons delivered in 2014 to 308.5 million gallons delivered in 2015, which provided approximately $36.6 million in increased revenue for 2015 compared to 2014. The increase in volume was due to a 46.6 million gallon increase in CNG volume delivered, which was primarily attributable to 22 new refuse customers, six new transit customers and seven new trucking customers partially offset by a decrease of 3.4 million gallons in RNG volume delivered, primarily due to the sale in December 2014 of our interest in DCE and, with it, our interest in a RNG extraction and processing project at the McCommas Bluff landfill in Dallas, Texas. LNG volume delivered was relatively flat between periods.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales decreased by $50.3 million to $258.5 million for 2015, from $308.8 million for 2014. The decrease was primarily due to fewer station and compressor sales, as we experienced a $24.0 million decrease in station installation costs and a $28.1 million decrease in compressor costs between periods due to decreased activity. Our effective cost per gallon decreased by $0.09 per gallon, from $0.65 per gallon for 2014 to $0.56 per gallon for 2015. Our effective cost per gallon is defined as the total costs associated with delivering natural gas, including gas commodity costs, transportation fees, liquefaction charges, and other site operating costs, plus the total cost of providing O&M services at stations that we do not own and for which we receive a per-gallon fee, including direct technician labor, indirect supervisor and management labor, repair parts and other direct maintenance costs, all divided by the total GGEs delivered less GGEs delivered by non-consolidated entities, such as equity method investments. The decrease in our effective cost per gallon was primarily due to lower natural gas prices. The increased gas volumes delivered partially offset by decreased natural gas prices resulted in a net decrease of $1.2 million in gas commodity costs. In addition, service costs increased as a percentage of service revenues during 2015 due to lower margin services performed by Clean Energy Cryogenics and Clean Energy Compression compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a $3.0 million increase between periods of other natural gas delivery costs.\nGain from change in fair value of derivative warrants. Derivative gains decreased by $4.3 million to $1.4 million for 2015, from $5.7 million for 2014. These amounts represent the non-cash impact with respect to valuing our outstanding warrants based on our mark-to-market accounting for the warrants during the periods (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report).\nSelling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $12.7 million to $113.7 million for 2015, from $126.4 million for 2014. The decrease is primarily attributable to a $6.7 million decrease in employee-related expenses between periods due to company-wide cost cutting measures. Reduced expenditures in travel and entertainment, stock-based compensation expense, and business insurance premiums led to a decrease of $3.0 million compared to the prior period. Further contributing to the decrease between periods was the absence in 2015 of certain events that caused increased expenses in 2014, such as $1.3 million in retirement benefits related to the retirement of our former Chief Marketing Officer in 2014 and $0.6 million in severance costs related to the departure of our former Chief Financial Officer in 2014.\nImpairment of long-lived intangible definite lived assets. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded an impairment to an intangible asset contract acquired in connection with the Clean Energy Compression acquisition in an amount of $4.8 million. There were no impairments in 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased by $6.1 million to $55.2 million for 2015, from $49.1 million for 2014. This increase was primarily due to additional depreciation expense in 2015 related to increased property and equipment balances between periods from our expanded station network and assets we acquired in our acquisition of NG Advantage during the fourth quarter of 2014.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by $51.1 million to $95.8 million for 2015, from $44.7 million for 2014. This increase was primarily due to a non-cash charge related to the elimination of unamortized debt issuance costs of $54.9 million associated with our termination of our Credit Agreement with GE. This increase was partially offset when compared to interest expense 2014 by the extinguishment of the Mavrix Note and resulting discontinuation of interest accrual thereunder in December 2014 (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of our outstanding debt).\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net, increased by $5.2 million to $2.6 million for 2015, from $(2.6) million for 2014. This increase was primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate changes between periods on our Clean Energy Compression customer deposits held in foreign currencies and a $1.4 million gain from a litigation settlement in 2015.\nLoss from equity method investment. Losses from our equity method investments increased by $0.3 million to $0.8 million for 2015, compared to a loss of $0.5 million for 2014 due to losses from our MCEP joint venture, which was formed in September 2014.\nGain from sale of subsidiary. In 2014, we recorded a gain of $12.0 million from the sale of DCE and in 2015 we recorded a related earn-out of $0.9 million (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of the sale of DCE).\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense increased by $0.5 million to $1.6 million for 2015 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our tax on foreign operations between periods.\nLoss (income) of noncontrolling interest. In 2015, we recorded $1.2 million for the noncontrolling interest in the net income of NG Advantage and in 2014 we recorded a total of $1.2 million for the noncontrolling interest in the net income of DCE and NG Advantage (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional discussion of the noncontrolling interests in DCE and NG Advantage). The noncontrolling interests represent the 46.7% noncontrolling interest in NG Advantage upon our acquisition of a 53.3% interest in NG Advantage in October 2014, and the 30% interest of our joint venture partner in DCE until September 2014 when we sold 19% of DCE to our joint venture partner, which increased its interest from 30% to 49%. In December 2014, we sold our remaining 51% ownership interest in DCE to the joint venture partner.\nSeasonality and Inflation\nTo some extent, we experience seasonality in our results of operations. Natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tend to be higher in summer months when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems. Natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods.\nSince our inception, inflation has not significantly affected our operating results; however, costs for construction, repairs, maintenance, electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately, build new stations, expand our existing facilities or pursue additional facilities, and could materially increase our operating costs.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nCash provided by operating activities was $46.1 million in 2016, an increase of $58.2 million, compared to $12.1 million used in 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of improved operating results of $36.4 million, exclusive of non-cash expenses and gains, due to an increase in our gross margin and lower interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase in cash provided by operations was also attributed to a reduction in net working capital of approximately $21.8 million, which resulted primarily from a decrease in other receivables at year end related to the timing of fuel tax credit revenue recognition and cash receipts thereof.\nCash used in operating activities was $12.1 million in 2015, a decrease of $63.9 million, compared to $76.0 million used in operating activities in 2014. The decrease in cash used between periods is primarily due to an improvement in our net loss of $26.4 million, net of non-cash adjustments, and increased cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately $37.5 million which includes the cash receipt of $28.4 million of VETC revenues attributable to natural gas vehicle fuel sales in 2014, plus $9.1 million of normal changes in working capital due to timing differences.\nCash provided by investing activities was $1.1 million in 2016, an increase of $35.0 million compared to $33.9 million used in investing activities in 2015. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to decreased capital expenditures of $27.8 million between periods, due to cost-cutting efforts and a decrease in construction of Company-owned stations. Additionally, cash provided by our short-term investments that matured, net of purchases, increased by $10.5 million between periods. Partially offsetting this increase in cash provided by investing activities was $0.8 million used in 2016 in connection with the RNG Ventures, which were formed in November 2016 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements) and $1.1 million received in 2015 from the sale of DCE which did not occur again in 2016.\nCash used in investing activities was $33.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $13.0 million, compared to $46.9 million in 2014. Capital expenditures decreased by $37.2 million primarily due to our purchase in 2014 of 67 CNG-In-A-Box units (relatively small turn-key, self-contained CNG stations) for $18.4 million which were not repeated in 2015 and less construction of Company owned stations between periods. In 2014, we received $39.8 million in net cash proceeds for the sale of DCE and in 2015 we received an additional $1.1 million for certain related performance tests. Additionally, we had an increase of $3.9 million of cash provided from our maturities, net of purchases of short term investments, and a decrease of $6.6 million used for investments in other entities due to the absence of any such investments in 2015.\nCash used in financing activities was $55.6 million in 2016 compared to $0.4 million provided by financing activities in 2015. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $56.0 million was primarily due to a $231.5 million increase in debt payments, repayments of long term debt prior to maturity and repayment of our line of credit. Partially offsetting this increase in cash used in financing activities was a $96.4 million increase in cash as a result of our sales of common stock through the ATM\nprogram (as defined and discussed below) and a $80.5 million increase as a result of proceeds from our PlainsCapital Bank credit facility and other debt proceeds.\nCash provided by financing activities was $0.4 million in 2015, an increase of $26.2 million, compared to $25.8 million used in 2014. The change was primarily due to the excess of repayments of borrowings over proceeds from such borrowings in 2014 that was not repeated in 2015. The repayments in 2014 relate to the payoffs of a revolving line of credit and the Mavrix Note. Offsetting the repayments in 2014 was proceeds from the issuance of the Canton Bonds by our Canton subsidiary for $12.4 million in 2014, with no issuance in 2015. Additionally, there was an increase of $4.0 million in proceeds from issuances of common stock in 2015 which includes cash received from our ATM Program described below.\nCapital Expenditures and Other Uses of Cash.\nWe require cash to fund our capital expenditures, operating expenses and working capital requirements, including costs associated with fuel sales, outlays for the design and construction of new fueling stations, additions or other modifications to existing fuel stations, debt repayments and repurchases, purchases of new CNG tanker trailers, maintenance of LNG production facilities, manufacturing natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment, mergers and acquisitions (if any), financing natural gas vehicles for our customers and general corporate purposes, including geographic expansion (domestically and internationally), pursuing new customer markets and supporting our sales and marketing activities, including supporting legislative and regulatory initiatives.\nOur business plan calls for approximately $29.0 million in capital expenditures in 2017, primarily related to the construction of CNG and LNG fueling stations, additional investments in ANGH stations to add CNG fueling, the purchase of additional CNG trailers by NG Advantage and LNG plant maintenance costs.\nWe had total indebtedness of approximately $314.3 million in principal amount as of December 31, 2016, of which approximately $6.1 million, $189.6 million, $55.5 million, $54.6 million, $4.0 million and $4.5 million is expected to become due in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and thereafter, respectively. Additionally, we expect our total interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness to be approximately $19.7 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. We generally intend to make payments under our various debt instruments when due and pursue opportunities for earlier repayment and/or refinancing if and when opportunities arise. With respect to certain of our outstanding indebtedness due in 2018, our board of directors authorized and approved the purchase of our outstanding 5.25% Notes in the open market, in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% Notes and at the date of this report we have used an aggregate $84.3 million for such purchases.\nWe may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies, assets or joint ventures in the natural gas fueling infrastructure, vehicle or services industries or use capital for other activities or pursuits, including those described above.\nSources of Cash.\nHistorically, our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash on hand, cash provided by our operations, including, if available, grants, VETC and other credits and cash provided by financing activities and sales of assets. As of December 31, 2016, we had total cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $109.8 million, compared to $146.7 million at December 31, 2015.\nWe expect cash provided by our operating activities to fluctuate depending on our operating results, which can be affected by natural gas prices and sale activity, fluctuations in commodity costs and the amount and timing of recognition of government credits, sales of RINs and LCFS Credits, compressor and other equipment sales, station construction sales and our billing, collections and liability payments, among other factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report for further information.\nWe commenced the ATM Program on November 11, 2015. We were initially permitted to issue and sell, from time to time, through or to Citigroup, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million in the ATM Program. On September 9, 2016 and December 21, 2016, we have increased the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program, first to $110.0 million and subsequently to $200.0 million. As of the date of this report, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of $78.7 million remain available for sale in the ATM Program. We continue to use any net proceeds from the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, including retiring certain of our indebtedness.\nThe following table summarizes the activity under the ATM Program for the periods presented:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Through March 7,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees and issuance costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net proceeds\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares issued\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 29, 2016, we entered into the Credit Facility with Plains, pursuant to which Plains agreed to lend us up to $50.0 million on a revolving basis for a term of one year. Simultaneously, we drew down $50.0 million under the Credit Facility, which we repaid in full on August 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the Credit Facility's maturity date was extended from February 28, 2017 to September 30, 2018. On December 22, 2016 we drew down $23.5 million under the Credit Facility which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nSee Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a description of all of our outstanding debt.\nIn September and December 2014, we sold all of our interest in DCE and, with it, our interest in a RNG extraction and processing project at the McCommas Bluff landfill in Dallas, Texas. As consideration for this sale, we received $7.0 million in cash in September 2014, $40.6 million in cash in December 2014 and $1.1 million in cash in September 2015 due to the results of certain performance tests performed at the McCommas Bluffs project.\nIn February 2017, we entered into the APA to sell the RNG Assets relating to our RNG production business. If this Asset Sale closes as planned, we expect to receive $155.0 million in cash and the right to receive up to an additional $25.0 million in cash over a five-year period if certain performance criteria relating to the RNG Assets are met. In addition, we will collect royalties on gas purchased from BP and sold as Redeem at our stations. This royalty payment is in addition to any payment obligation of BP under the APA.\nWe believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and cash provided by our operating and financing activities will satisfy our routine business requirements for at least the next 12 months; however, we will need to raise additional capital to fund any capital expenditures, investments or debt repayments that we cannot fund through available cash, cash provided by our operations or other sources, such as with our common stock.\nThe timing and necessity of any future capital raise would depend on various factors, including our rate of new station construction, debt repayments (either prior to or at maturity), any potential merger or acquisition activity and the other factors that influence our liquidity, as described under -Overview-Liquidity\u201d above.\nWe may seek to raise additional capital through one or more sources, including, among others, selling assets, obtaining new or restructuring existing debt, obtaining equity capital (including through the ATM Program or other equity offerings), or any combination of these or other available sources of capital. We may not be able to raise capital when needed, on terms that are favorable to us or our stockholders or at all. Any inability to raise necessary capital may impair our ability to build new stations, develop natural gas fueling infrastructure, invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions or repay our outstanding indebtedness and may reduce our ability to build our business and generate sustained or increased revenue.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016:\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations: (in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt and capital lease obligations(a)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>361,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,756\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269,398\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease commitments(b)\n</td> <td>48,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term \"take or pay\" natural gas purchase commitment contracts(c)\n</td> <td>13,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction contracts(d)\n</td> <td>7,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>430,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>290,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Consists of long-term debt and capital lease obligations to finance acquisitions and equipment purchases, including future interest payments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(b)\n</td> <td>Consists of various space and ground leases for our California LNG plant, office spaces and fueling stations as well as leases for equipment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(c)\n</td> <td>Represents our estimates for two long-term fixed \"take-or-pay\" natural gas purchase commitment contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(d)\n</td> <td>Consists of our obligations to fund various fueling station construction projects, net of amounts funded through December 31, 2016 and excluding contractual commitments related to station sales contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had the following off-balance sheet arrangements that had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources:\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling $63.8 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Two long-term take-or-pay contracts for the purchase of natural gas; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating leases where we are the lessee.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of business, as a form of guarantee. No liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds as we do not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed.\nWe have two long-term take-or-pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of natural gas at index based prices which expire in March 2020 and December 2020, respectively.\nWe have entered into operating lease arrangements for certain equipment and for our office and field operating locations in the ordinary course of our business. The terms of our leases expire at various dates through 2038. Additionally, in November 2006, we entered into a ground lease for 36 acres in California on which we built our California LNG liquefaction plant. The lease is for an initial term of 30 years and requires payments of $0.2 million per year, plus up to $0.1 million per year for each 30 million gallons of production capacity utilized, subject to adjustment based on consumer price index changes. We must also pay a royalty to the landlord for each gallon of LNG produced at the facility, as well as a fee for certain other services that the landlord provides.", "summary": "The report discusses the forward-looking statements, revenue sources, and key operating data of a company that provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets.

Our principal business is supplying CNG, LNG and RNG (which can be delivered in the form of CNG or LNG) for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles and providing operation and maintenance (\"O&M\") services for vehicle fleet customer stations. As a comprehensive solution provider, we also design, build, operate and maintain fueling stations, manufacture, sell and service non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment used in CNG stations and LNG stations, offer assessment, design and modification solutions to provide operators with code-compliant service and maintenance facilities for natural gas vehicle fleets, transport and sell CNG and LNG to industrial and institutional energy users who do not have direct access to natural gas pipelines, sell RNG, sell tradable credits we generate by selling natural gas and RNG as a vehicle fuel, including credits under the California and Oregon Low Carbon Fuel Standards (collectively, \"LCFS Credits\") and Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RIN Credits\" or \"RINs\") under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard Phase 2, help our customers acquire and finance natural gas vehicles and obtain federal, state and local tax credits, grants and incentives.\nOverview\nThis overview discusses matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and results.\nSources of Revenue.\nThe following table represents our sources of revenue:\n\n (1) Our volume-related revenue primarily consists of CNG, LNG and RNG fuel sales, RINs and LCFS Credits sales and O&M services. \n (2) Represents a federal alternative fuels tax credit that we refer to as \"VETC.\"  Key Operating Data.\nIn evaluating our operating performance, our management focuses primarily on: (1) the amount of CNG, LNG and RNG gasoline gallon equivalents delivered (which we define as (i) the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents we sell to our customers, plus (ii) the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents dispensed at facilities we do not own but where we provide O&M services on a per-gallon or fixed fee basis, plus (iii) our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents sold as CNG by our joint venture with Mansfield Ventures, LLC called Mansfield Clean Energy Partners, LLC ( MCEP\u201d), plus (iv) our proportionate share (as applicable) of the gasoline gallon equivalents of RNG produced and sold as pipeline quality natural gas by the RNG production facilities we own or operate), (2) our station construction cost of sales, (3) our gross margin (which we define as revenue minus cost of sales), and (4) net income (loss) attributable to us. The following tables, which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report, present our key operating data for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015, and 2016:\n\n\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) As noted above, includes our proportionate share of the GGEs sold as CNG by our joint venture MCEP, which were 0.0 million, 0.4 million and 0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. \n (2) Represents RNG sold as non-vehicle fuel. RNG sold as vehicle fuel is included in CNG and LNG. \n (3) Represents gasoline gallon equivalents at stations where we provide both fuel and O&M services. \n (4) Includes $28.4 million, $31.0 million and $26.6 million of revenue from VETC for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Recent Developments\nRNG Production.\nIn November 2016, our subsidiary, Clean Energy Renewables (\"Renewables\") entered into agreements to form joint ventures with Aria Energy Operating LLC ( Aria\u201d), a developer of RNG production facilities, to develop RNG production facilities at a Republic Services landfill in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and an Advanced Disposal landfill near Atlanta, Georgia. We refer to these joint ventures as the RNG Ventures.\u201d Renewables and Aria each have a 50% ownership interest in the RNG Ventures and, subject to certain conditions, are each responsible for 50% of the costs of developing the RNG production facilities that are owned by the RNG Ventures. We also have the exclusive right to purchase 100% of the RNG that will be produced by these facilities for the vehicle fuels market. As of December 31, 2016, we have an investment balance of $0.8 million in the RNG Ventures. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.\nOn February 27, 2017, Renewables entered into an asset purchase agreement (the APA\u201d) with BP Products North America, Inc. ( BP\u201d), pursuant to which Renewables agreed to sell to BP certain assets relating to its RNG production business, including our two existing RNG production facilities and our interest in the RNG Ventures (collectively, the RNG Assets\u201d), in exchange for $155.0 million in cash and the right to receive up to an additional $25.0 million in cash over a five-year period if certain performance criteria relating to the RNG Assets are met (the Asset Sale\u201d). In addition, we will collect royalties on gas purchased from BP and sold as Redeem at our stations. This royalty payment is in addition to any payment obligation of BP under the APA. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of required government and third-party consents and approvals, the Asset Sale is expected to close on or before March 31, 2017. At the closing of the Asset Sale, BP will pay $30.0 million of the closing purchase price in cash and deliver to us a promissory note for $125.0 million to be paid on April 3, 2017. Following completion of the Asset Sale we will continue to obtain RNG from third-party producers, including RNG produced from the production facilities to be sold in the Asset Sale and sold to us by BP under a long-term supply contract, and resell such RNG through our natural gas fueling infrastructure as Redeem\u2122, our RNG vehicle fuel.\nDebt Arrangements. On February 29, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with, and issued a related promissory note to, PlainsCapital Bank (\"Plains\"), pursuant to which Plains agreed to lend us up to $50.0 million on a revolving basis for a term of one year (the \"Credit Facility\"). Simultaneously, we drew down $50.0 million under the Credit Facility, which we repaid in full on August 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the Credit Facility's maturity date was extended from February 28, 2017 to September 30, 2018. On December 22, 2016 we drew down $23.5 million under the Credit Facility, which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nOn March 1, 2016 and pursuant to the consent of the holders of our outstanding 7.5% convertible promissory notes due in August 2016 (the \"SLG Notes\"), we prepaid in cash an aggregate of $60.0 million in principal amount and $1.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest owed under the SLG Notes. Additionally, on July 14, 2016, we entered into separate privately negotiated exchange agreements with each holder of an SLG Note to exchange the outstanding principal amount of each SLG Note, totaling $85.0 million for all SLG Notes, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, totaling $0.2 million for all SLG Notes, for an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of our common stock and $38.2 million in cash. We recognized a loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the settlement of the SLG Notes. The repurchased and exchanged SLG Notes have been surrendered and canceled in full and we have no further obligations under the SLG Notes.\nIn 2016, our board of directors authorized and approved our purchase of our outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"5.25% Notes\") in the open market, in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% Notes. Pursuant to this approval, in 2016, we paid an aggregate of $84.3 million in cash to repurchase and retire $114.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Additionally, pursuant to a privately negotiated exchange agreement with certain holders of the 5.25% Notes, on May 4, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 6,265,829 shares of our common stock in exchange for an aggregate principal amount of $25 million of 5.25% Notes held by such holders, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Our repurchase and exchange of 5.25% Notes in 2016 resulted in a total gain of $35.2 million recorded during the period. All repurchased and exchanged 5.25% Notes have been surrendered to the trustee for such notes and canceled in full and we have no further obligations under such notes.\nIn February 2017, we purchased from one of our directors and significant stockholders, T. Boone Pickens, the 7.5% Convertible Note due July 2018 having an outstanding principal amount of $25.0 million held by Mr. Pickens for a cash purchase price of $21.75 million.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about our debt.\nATM Program. On November 11, 2015, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citigroup\"), as sales agent and/or principal, to commence an \"at-the-market\" offering program (the \"ATM Program\"). Initially, we were permitted to issue and sell, from time to time, through or to Citigroup, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million in the ATM Program. On September 9, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated equity distribution agreement with Citigroup for the primary purpose of increasing, from $75.0 million to $110.0 million, the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program. On December 21, 2016, we entered into a second amended and restated equity distribution agreement with Citigroup for the primary purpose of increasing, from $110.0 million to $200.0 million, the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program.\nVETC Expiration. On December 31, 2016, the VETC alternative fuels tax credit expired and ceased to be available, and it may not be available in any subsequent period. Under VETC, we were eligible to receive credits of $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per liquid gallon of LNG that we sold as a vehicle fuel through December 31, 2015, and $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per diesel gallon equivalent of LNG that we sold as a vehicle fuel from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through operating cash flows, the sale or maturity of investments or other assets or the acquisition of additional funds through capital management or capital-raising transactions. Our liquidity is, and will continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors, including the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the principal and interest we are obligated to pay on our indebtedness, our capital expenditure requirements and any merger, divestiture or acquisition activity, as well as our ability to generate cash flows from our operations or from other sources. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for additional information.\nDebt Level and Debt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $314.3 million in principal amount, of which approximately $6.1 million is expected to become due in 2017. Certain of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, which are discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, have certain non-financial covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.\nBusiness Risks and Uncertainties\nOur business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.\nKey Trends\nRecent Trends\nMarket for Natural Gas. CNG and LNG are generally less expensive than gasoline and diesel on an energy equivalent basis and, according to studies conducted by the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") and Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, cleaner than gasoline and diesel fuel. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for natural gas fuels in the United States has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase. We believe the growth in demand in recent years is attributable primarily\nto the higher prices of gasoline and diesel relative to CNG and LNG during much of this period, increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets and increased supply of natural gas.\nIn the recent past, however, the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas have been significantly lower and volatile, and these trends of lower prices and volatility may continue. Additionally, in spite of growth in demand in recent years, there are significant uncertainties affecting the current market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, including growing favor among lawmakers, regulators, other policy makers and other powerful industry participants for other alternative fuels or vehicles, including electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, and uncertainties regarding the availability and effect on our business of environmental and other regulations, programs or incentives that promote cleaner vehicle fuels, particularly in light of the results of the recent U.S. presidential election. These conditions have resulted in lower revenue levels in certain periods due in large part to a decreased pricing advantage when comparing natural gas prices to diesel and gasoline prices, which we believe has decreased overall demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, and reduced the prices we have been charging our customers for CNG and LNG, which have reduced our profit margins. To the extent these volatile and lower-pricing conditions and other uncertainties persist, our financial results may continue to be adversely affected.\nOur Performance. Our gross revenue is mostly comprised of volume related revenue, compressor and other equipment sales, station construction sales, and VETC revenue. Our revenue can vary between periods due to a variety of factors, including natural gas prices and sale activity, fluctuations in commodity costs and the amount and timing of recognition of government credits, sales of RINs and LCFS credits, compressor and other equipment sales and station construction sales. Our volume-related revenue, which is further discussed below, increased from 2014 to 2016, due largely to the increase in gallons we delivered, and sales of tradable credits in 2015 and 2016.\nOur cost of sales can also vary between periods due to a variety of factors, including the factors described above.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for a further discussion of our performance.\nVolume-Related Revenue. The amount of CNG, LNG and RNG GGEs we delivered increased by 24.1% from 2014 to 2016.\nThe RNG we sell for vehicle fuel, which is delivered in the form of CNG or LNG is distributed under the name Redeem\u2122. The amount of Redeem vehicle fuel we delivered increased from 20.2 million GGEs in 2014 to 58.6 million GGEs in 2016, a 190.1% increase. We believe this demand for Redeem\u2122 is largely attributable to the lower greenhouse gas emissions that it produces relative to gasoline and diesel.\nOur sales of increasing volumes of CNG, LNG and RNG for use as a vehicle fuel has resulted in our generation of increasing amounts of RINs and LCFS Credits which, together with the increasing prices for RINs and LCFS Credits, has resulted in increased revenue associated with these credits.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue from RINs and LCFS Credits:\n\nAlthough we expect to continue to generate revenue relating to the sale of RINs and LCFS Credits from our continued sales of our Redeem RNG vehicle fuel, the amount of revenue we would receive from the sale of such credits will decrease if the existing RNG Assets are sold in the Asset Sale as planned, which would adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our effective price per gallon in future periods as compared to 2016. Completion of the Asset Sale will, however, improve our liquidity. Further, the markets for RINs and LCFS Credits have historically been volatile, and the prices for these credits have been subject to significant fluctuations. Additionally, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits may be adversely affected by any changes to the federal and state programs under which such credits are generated and sold. For example, CARB recently raised the carbon intensity rating of the RNG we sell in California, which will reduce the amount of LCFS Credits we generate.\nOur Stations. The number of fueling stations we owned, operated, maintained and/or supplied increased from over 470 as of January 1, 2014 to over 570 as of December 31, 2016 (a 21.3% increase). Included in this number are all of the CNG and LNG fueling stations we own, operate, maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract.\nWe have made a significant commitment of capital and other resources to build a nationwide network of natural gas truck friendly fueling stations, which we refer to as \"America's Natural Gas Highway\" or \"ANGH.\" At December 31, 2016, we had 39 completed ANGH stations that were not open for fueling operations. We expect to open these stations when we have sufficient customers to fuel at the locations, but we do not know when this will occur. We believe that growth in the heavy-duty truck customers depends, in part, on the adoption of natural gas engines that are well-suited for heavy-duty trucks, which has been slower and more limited than anticipated. If heavy-duty trucking customers do not develop and if we do not open these stations, we will continue to have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenue.\nAnticipated Future Trends.\nAlthough natural gas continues to be less expensive than gasoline and diesel in most markets, the price of natural gas has been significantly closer to the prices of gasoline and diesel in recent years as a result of lower oil prices, thereby reducing the price advantage of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. We anticipate that, over the long term, the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and will increase overall, which would improve the cost savings of natural gas compared to gasoline and diesel. It is uncertain, however, whether the prices for gasoline and diesel will increase from their current levels, and we expect that adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and growth in our customer base and revenue will be negatively affected while oil and diesel prices remain low. Our belief that natural gas will continue, over the long term, to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in recent years of natural gas production in the United States, as well as increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets, which we believe drives the market for alternative fuels generally.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for natural gas fuels in the United States is expected to increase. We believe natural gas fuels are well-suited for use by vehicle fleets that consume high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are increasingly required to reduce emissions. As a result, we believe there will be growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets, and our goal is to capitalize on this trend, if and when it materializes, and to enhance our leadership position in these markets. Our business plan calls for expanding our sales of natural gas vehicle fuel in the markets in which we operate, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, government fleets and industrial and institutional energy users, and pursuing additional markets as opportunities arise. Additionally, we expect that the lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with our Redeem vehicle fuel will result in continued increased demand for this fuel, resulting in our delivery of increasing volumes of Redeem to our vehicle fleet customers. If these projections materialize and our business grows as we anticipate, then our operating costs and capital expenditures may increase, primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network, additional investments in ANGH stations to add CNG fueling, purchases of additional CNG trailers by NG Advantage, and increased RNG production, as well as the logistics of delivering more natural gas fuel to our customers. We also may seek to acquire assets and/or businesses that are in the natural gas fueling infrastructure, which may require us to spend additional capital.\nAlthough we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel to remain steady in the near-term, we expect competition in the alternative fuels market generally to increase. Any such increased competition would lead to amplified pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities.\nRisk Management Activities\nFrom time to time, we enter into natural gas fuel sales contracts that require us to sell CNG or LNG to our customers at a fixed price. These contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell the natural gas to our customers.\nIn an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to any futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to our fixed price sales contracts, we operate under a natural gas hedging policy pursuant to which we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid. Subject to the conditions set forth in the policy, we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to effectively hedge our exposure to cash flow variability related to fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy. Unless otherwise agreed in advance by our board of directors and the derivatives committee thereof, we will conduct our futures contract activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy.\nDue to the restrictions of our hedging policy, we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers. If we do offer a fixed price sales contract, we anticipate including a price component that would cover our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts. The amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contract.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenue on various products and services.\nOur volume related revenue primarily consists of CNG, LNG and RNG fuel sales, RINs and LCFS Credits sales and O&M services. This revenue is recognized in accordance with US GAAP, which requires that the following four criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nApplying the factors above, we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas fuel at the time the fuel is dispensed or, in the case of LNG sales agreements, delivered to our customers' storage facilities. We generate LCFS Credits when we sell RNG and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon and we generate RIN Credits when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel. We can sell these credits to third parties who need the RINs and LCFS Credits to comply with federal and state emission requirements. We recognize revenue from the generation of these credits when we have an agreement in place to sell the credits at a fixed or determinable price. We recognize revenue from O&M service agreements as we provide the related services.\nWe recognize compression revenue through our subsidiary Clean Energy Compression when it sells non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment. Clean Energy Compression uses the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize revenue", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Recent Developments\nRNG Production.\nIn November 2016, our subsidiary, Clean Energy Renewables (\"Renewables\") entered into agreements to form joint ventures with Aria Energy Operating LLC ( Aria\u201d), a developer of RNG production facilities, to develop RNG production facilities at a Republic Services landfill in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and an Advanced Disposal landfill near Atlanta, Georgia. We refer to these joint ventures as the RNG Ventures.\u201d Renewables and Aria each have a 50% ownership interest in the RNG Ventures and, subject to certain conditions, are each responsible for 50% of the costs of developing the RNG production facilities that are owned by the RNG Ventures. We also have the exclusive right to purchase 100% of the RNG that will be produced by these facilities for the vehicle fuels market. As of December 31, 2016, we have an investment balance of $0.8 million in the RNG Ventures. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.\nOn February 27, 2017, Renewables entered into an asset purchase agreement (the APA\u201d) with BP Products North America, Inc. ( BP\u201d), pursuant to which Renewables agreed to sell to BP certain assets relating to its RNG production business, including our two existing RNG production facilities and our interest in the RNG Ventures (collectively, the RNG Assets\u201d), in exchange for $155.0 million in cash and the right to receive up to an additional $25.0 million in cash over a five-year period if certain performance criteria relating to the RNG Assets are met (the Asset Sale\u201d). In addition, we will collect royalties on gas purchased from BP and sold as Redeem at our stations. This royalty payment is in addition to any payment obligation of BP under the APA. Subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including, among others, the receipt of required government and third-party consents and approvals, the Asset Sale is expected to close on or before March 31, 2017. At the closing of the Asset Sale, BP will pay $30.0 million of the closing purchase price in cash and deliver to us a promissory note for $125.0 million to be paid on April 3, 2017. Following completion of the Asset Sale we will continue to obtain RNG from third-party producers, including RNG produced from the production facilities to be sold in the Asset Sale and sold to us by BP under a long-term supply contract, and resell such RNG through our natural gas fueling infrastructure as Redeem\u2122, our RNG vehicle fuel.\nDebt Arrangements. On February 29, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with, and issued a related promissory note to, PlainsCapital Bank (\"Plains\"), pursuant to which Plains agreed to lend us up to $50.0 million on a revolving basis for a term of one year (the \"Credit Facility\"). Simultaneously, we drew down $50.0 million under the Credit Facility, which we repaid in full on August 31, 2016. On October 31, 2016, the Credit Facility's maturity date was extended from February 28, 2017 to September 30, 2018. On December 22, 2016 we drew down $23.5 million under the Credit Facility, which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nOn March 1, 2016 and pursuant to the consent of the holders of our outstanding 7.5% convertible promissory notes due in August 2016 (the \"SLG Notes\"), we prepaid in cash an aggregate of $60.0 million in principal amount and $1.8 million in accrued and unpaid interest owed under the SLG Notes. Additionally, on July 14, 2016, we entered into separate privately negotiated exchange agreements with each holder of an SLG Note to exchange the outstanding principal amount of each SLG Note, totaling $85.0 million for all SLG Notes, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, totaling $0.2 million for all SLG Notes, for an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of our common stock and $38.2 million in cash. We recognized a loss of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the settlement of the SLG Notes. The repurchased and exchanged SLG Notes have been surrendered and canceled in full and we have no further obligations under the SLG Notes.\nIn 2016, our board of directors authorized and approved our purchase of our outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the \"5.25% Notes\") in the open market, in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the 5.25% Notes. Pursuant to this approval, in 2016, we paid an aggregate of $84.3 million in cash to repurchase and retire $114.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Additionally, pursuant to a privately negotiated exchange agreement with certain holders of the 5.25% Notes, on May 4, 2016, we issued an aggregate of 6,265,829 shares of our common stock in exchange for an aggregate principal amount of $25 million of 5.25% Notes held by such holders, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon. Our repurchase and exchange of 5.25% Notes in 2016 resulted in a total gain of $35.2 million recorded during the period. All repurchased and exchanged 5.25% Notes have been surrendered to the trustee for such notes and canceled in full and we have no further obligations under such notes.\nIn February 2017, we purchased from one of our directors and significant stockholders, T. Boone Pickens, the 7.5% Convertible Note due July 2018 having an outstanding principal amount of $25.0 million held by Mr. Pickens for a cash purchase price of $21.75 million.\nSee Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information about our debt.\nATM Program. On November 11, 2015, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (\"Citigroup\"), as sales agent and/or principal, to commence an \"at-the-market\" offering program (the \"ATM Program\"). Initially, we were permitted to issue and sell, from time to time, through or to Citigroup, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million in the ATM Program. On September 9, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated equity distribution agreement with Citigroup for the primary purpose of increasing, from $75.0 million to $110.0 million, the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program. On December 21, 2016, we entered into a second amended and restated equity distribution agreement with Citigroup for the primary purpose of increasing, from $110.0 million to $200.0 million, the aggregate offering price of shares of our common stock available for issuance and sale in the ATM Program.\nVETC Expiration. On December 31, 2016, the VETC alternative fuels tax credit expired and ceased to be available, and it may not be available in any subsequent period. Under VETC, we were eligible to receive credits of $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per liquid gallon of LNG that we sold as a vehicle fuel through December 31, 2015, and $0.50 per gasoline gallon equivalent of CNG and $0.50 per diesel gallon equivalent of LNG that we sold as a vehicle fuel from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations through operating cash flows, the sale or maturity of investments or other assets or the acquisition of additional funds through capital management or capital-raising transactions. Our liquidity is, and will continue to be, influenced by a variety of factors, including the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the principal and interest we are obligated to pay on our indebtedness, our capital expenditure requirements and any merger, divestiture or acquisition activity, as well as our ability to generate cash flows from our operations or from other sources. See \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below for additional information.\nDebt Level and Debt Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total indebtedness of $314.3 million in principal amount, of which approximately $6.1 million is expected to become due in 2017. Certain of the agreements governing our outstanding debt, which are discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, have certain non-financial covenants with which we must comply. As of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all of these covenants.\nBusiness Risks and Uncertainties\nOur business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in this report.\nKey Trends\nRecent Trends\nMarket for Natural Gas. CNG and LNG are generally less expensive than gasoline and diesel on an energy equivalent basis and, according to studies conducted by the California Air Resources Board (\"CARB\") and Argonne National Laboratory, a research laboratory operated by the University of Chicago for the U.S. Department of Energy, cleaner than gasoline and diesel fuel. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for natural gas fuels in the United States has increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase. We believe the growth in demand in recent years is attributable primarily\nto the higher prices of gasoline and diesel relative to CNG and LNG during much of this period, increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets and increased supply of natural gas.\nIn the recent past, however, the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas have been significantly lower and volatile, and these trends of lower prices and volatility may continue. Additionally, in spite of growth in demand in recent years, there are significant uncertainties affecting the current market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, including growing favor among lawmakers, regulators, other policy makers and other powerful industry participants for other alternative fuels or vehicles, including electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles, and uncertainties regarding the availability and effect on our business of environmental and other regulations, programs or incentives that promote cleaner vehicle fuels, particularly in light of the results of the recent U.S. presidential election. These conditions have resulted in lower revenue levels in certain periods due in large part to a decreased pricing advantage when comparing natural gas prices to diesel and gasoline prices, which we believe has decreased overall demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel, and reduced the prices we have been charging our customers for CNG and LNG, which have reduced our profit margins. To the extent these volatile and lower-pricing conditions and other uncertainties persist, our financial results may continue to be adversely affected.\nOur Performance. Our gross revenue is mostly comprised of volume related revenue, compressor and other equipment sales, station construction sales, and VETC revenue. Our revenue can vary between periods due to a variety of factors, including natural gas prices and sale activity, fluctuations in commodity costs and the amount and timing of recognition of government credits, sales of RINs and LCFS credits, compressor and other equipment sales and station construction sales. Our volume-related revenue, which is further discussed below, increased from 2014 to 2016, due largely to the increase in gallons we delivered, and sales of tradable credits in 2015 and 2016.\nOur cost of sales can also vary between periods due to a variety of factors, including the factors described above.\nSee \"Results of Operations\" below for a further discussion of our performance.\nVolume-Related Revenue. The amount of CNG, LNG and RNG GGEs we delivered increased by 24.1% from 2014 to 2016.\nThe RNG we sell for vehicle fuel, which is delivered in the form of CNG or LNG is distributed under the name Redeem\u2122. The amount of Redeem vehicle fuel we delivered increased from 20.2 million GGEs in 2014 to 58.6 million GGEs in 2016, a 190.1% increase. We believe this demand for Redeem\u2122 is largely attributable to the lower greenhouse gas emissions that it produces relative to gasoline and diesel.\nOur sales of increasing volumes of CNG, LNG and RNG for use as a vehicle fuel has resulted in our generation of increasing amounts of RINs and LCFS Credits which, together with the increasing prices for RINs and LCFS Credits, has resulted in increased revenue associated with these credits.\nThe following table summarizes our revenue from RINs and LCFS Credits:\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RIN Credits\n</td> <td>2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LCFS Credits\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough we expect to continue to generate revenue relating to the sale of RINs and LCFS Credits from our continued sales of our Redeem RNG vehicle fuel, the amount of revenue we would receive from the sale of such credits will decrease if the existing RNG Assets are sold in the Asset Sale as planned, which would adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our effective price per gallon in future periods as compared to 2016. Completion of the Asset Sale will, however, improve our liquidity. Further, the markets for RINs and LCFS Credits have historically been volatile, and the prices for these credits have been subject to significant fluctuations. Additionally, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits may be adversely affected by any changes to the federal and state programs under which such credits are generated and sold. For example, CARB recently raised the carbon intensity rating of the RNG we sell in California, which will reduce the amount of LCFS Credits we generate.\nOur Stations. The number of fueling stations we owned, operated, maintained and/or supplied increased from over 470 as of January 1, 2014 to over 570 as of December 31, 2016 (a 21.3% increase). Included in this number are all of the CNG and LNG fueling stations we own, operate, maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract.\nWe have made a significant commitment of capital and other resources to build a nationwide network of natural gas truck friendly fueling stations, which we refer to as \"America's Natural Gas Highway\" or \"ANGH.\" At December 31, 2016, we had 39 completed ANGH stations that were not open for fueling operations. We expect to open these stations when we have sufficient customers to fuel at the locations, but we do not know when this will occur. We believe that growth in the heavy-duty truck customers depends, in part, on the adoption of natural gas engines that are well-suited for heavy-duty trucks, which has been slower and more limited than anticipated. If heavy-duty trucking customers do not develop and if we do not open these stations, we will continue to have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenue.\nAnticipated Future Trends.\nAlthough natural gas continues to be less expensive than gasoline and diesel in most markets, the price of natural gas has been significantly closer to the prices of gasoline and diesel in recent years as a result of lower oil prices, thereby reducing the price advantage of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. We anticipate that, over the long term, the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and will increase overall, which would improve the cost savings of natural gas compared to gasoline and diesel. It is uncertain, however, whether the prices for gasoline and diesel will increase from their current levels, and we expect that adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel and growth in our customer base and revenue will be negatively affected while oil and diesel prices remain low. Our belief that natural gas will continue, over the long term, to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in recent years of natural gas production in the United States, as well as increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets, which we believe drives the market for alternative fuels generally.\nAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, demand for natural gas fuels in the United States is expected to increase. We believe natural gas fuels are well-suited for use by vehicle fleets that consume high volumes of fuel, refuel at centralized locations or along well-defined routes and/or are increasingly required to reduce emissions. As a result, we believe there will be growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets, and our goal is to capitalize on this trend, if and when it materializes, and to enhance our leadership position in these markets. Our business plan calls for expanding our sales of natural gas vehicle fuel in the markets in which we operate, including heavy-duty trucking, airports, refuse, public transit, government fleets and industrial and institutional energy users, and pursuing additional markets as opportunities arise. Additionally, we expect that the lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with our Redeem vehicle fuel will result in continued increased demand for this fuel, resulting in our delivery of increasing volumes of Redeem to our vehicle fleet customers. If these projections materialize and our business grows as we anticipate, then our operating costs and capital expenditures may increase, primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network, additional investments in ANGH stations to add CNG fueling, purchases of additional CNG trailers by NG Advantage, and increased RNG production, as well as the logistics of delivering more natural gas fuel to our customers. We also may seek to acquire assets and/or businesses that are in the natural gas fueling infrastructure, which may require us to spend additional capital.\nAlthough we expect competition in the market for natural gas vehicle fuel to remain steady in the near-term, we expect competition in the alternative fuels market generally to increase. Any such increased competition would lead to amplified pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities.\nRisk Management Activities\nFrom time to time, we enter into natural gas fuel sales contracts that require us to sell CNG or LNG to our customers at a fixed price. These contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell the natural gas to our customers.\nIn an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to any futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to our fixed price sales contracts, we operate under a natural gas hedging policy pursuant to which we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid. Subject to the conditions set forth in the policy, we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to effectively hedge our exposure to cash flow variability related to fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy. Unless otherwise agreed in advance by our board of directors and the derivatives committee thereof, we will conduct our futures contract activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy.\nDue to the restrictions of our hedging policy, we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers. If we do offer a fixed price sales contract, we anticipate including a price component that would cover our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts. The amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contract.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\"). The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods.\nOn a periodic basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nWe recognize revenue on various products and services.\nOur volume related revenue primarily consists of CNG, LNG and RNG fuel sales, RINs and LCFS Credits sales and O&M services. This revenue is recognized in accordance with US GAAP, which requires that the following four criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered; (3) the price is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.\nApplying the factors above, we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas fuel at the time the fuel is dispensed or, in the case of LNG sales agreements, delivered to our customers' storage facilities. We generate LCFS Credits when we sell RNG and conventional natural gas for use as a vehicle fuel in California and Oregon and we generate RIN Credits when we sell RNG for use as a vehicle fuel. We can sell these credits to third parties who need the RINs and LCFS Credits to comply with federal and state emission requirements. We recognize revenue from the generation of these credits when we have an agreement in place to sell the credits at a fixed or determinable price. We recognize revenue from O&M service agreements as we provide the related services.\nWe recognize compression revenue through our subsidiary Clean Energy Compression when it sells non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and other equipment. Clean Energy Compression uses the percentage of completion method of accounting to recognize revenue"}
