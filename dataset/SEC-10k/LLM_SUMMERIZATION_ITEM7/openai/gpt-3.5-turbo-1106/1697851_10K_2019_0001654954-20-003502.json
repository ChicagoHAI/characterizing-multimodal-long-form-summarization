MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report and the historical financial statements of Rekor Systems, Inc., and the related notes thereto.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the field of advanced vehicle identification and management systems driven by leading edge advances in artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). In development for over five years using AI processes, including machine learning algorithms, our core software enables the creation of more powerful and capable vehicle recognition systems that can be deployed at a fraction of the cost of traditional vehicle recognition systems. The software enables a wider field of view, greater light sensitivity, recognitions at faster speeds and higher accuracy rates, in addition to the ability to identify the color, make and type of a vehicle and its direction of travel. These capabilities are particularly useful in solving a wide variety of real-world roadway and vehicle related challenges. In addition, the reductions in cost have opened up a number of new uses for vehicle recognition technology that were not previously cost effective. We currently provide products and services for governmental organizations, for large and small businesses and for individuals throughout the world. Customers are currently using our products or services in over 70 countries, with offerings for smart cities, public safety, security, transportation, parking and logistics.\nCurrently, our business activities include providing professional services in the government contracting, aerospace and aviation industries. As part of the development of a new line of products for the public safety and security markets, we acquired industry leading vehicle recognition software in March 2019. In connection with this acquisition, we determined that our resources are best concentrated on vehicle recognition products and services and have reorganized and retooled our product development, business development and administrative resources, with increasing emphasis on the technology area. Our Board of Directors has also authorized management to explore opportunities for the sale of our professional services businesses. In keeping with the shift in resources and strategic direction that this represents, we have reorganized our financial reporting into two business segments: the Technology Segment and the Professional Services Segment. These two segments reflect our separate focus on and expectations for technology products and services versus professional services.\nOn March 29, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved changing the Company's name to Rekor Systems, Inc. This name change was a result of our increased focus on technology products and services, and aligns with the renaming of Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. to Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. In connection with this name change, we changed:\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market to REKR\u201d and the CUSIP number for the common stock to 759419 104;\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for our Series A Preferred Stock on the OTC Markets OTCQB exchange to REKRP\u201d and the CUSIP number for our Series A Preferred Stock to 759419 203; and\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for warrants on the OTC Markets OTCQB exchange to REKRW\u201d and the CUSIP number for the warrants to 759419 112.\nTechnology Segment. The Technology Segment operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary, Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. ( Rekor Recognition\u201d). Formerly Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc., Rekor Recognition has been active in the public safety industry since 1996. In connection with the development of several new public safety products, we determined to acquire substantially all the assets of OpenALPR Technology, Inc. The OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, completed in March 2019, transferred vehicle recognition software and associated licenses and proprietary rights to OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC ( OpenALPR\u201d), a new wholly owned subsidiary of Rekor Recognition, as we have been focused on developing a line of products to transform the fundamental concepts of vehicle recognition. OpenALPR's vehicle recognition platform, already operating in more than 12,000 cameras in 70 countries worldwide, has laid the groundwork for the expansion of our product line, enabling multiple deployment mechanisms.\nSince the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, we have expanded our vehicle recognition product and service lines into a much broader range of customer segments, starting with public safety. We shifted from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription-based model, rebranded the software suites as Watchman\u201d and Car-Check\u201d and released several packaged hardware solutions with each of these vehicle recognition engines. By the end of 2019, we had a portfolio of more than 10 products, permitting us to offer full-scale vehicle recognition services for nearly any large or small public agency, commercial or residential setting.\nOur vehicle recognition software currently has the capability to analyze multi-spectral images and/or video streams produced by nearly any Internet Protocol security camera and concurrently extract license plate data by state from more than 70 countries, as well as provide the vehicle's make, color, type, and direction of travel. When combined with speed optimized code, parallel processing capability and best-in-class accessories, such as cameras and communications modules, Watchman software delivers vehicle recognition solutions at extremely high-capture rates and with a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, our multi-spectral capabilities enable reading of license plates and vehicle characteristics in unusually difficult conditions (e.g. low lighting, poor weather, extreme camera viewing angles, and obstructions).\nPrior to the development of our vehicle identification software, highly accurate results were not available using a typical Internet Protocol camera. We believe that the ability to use less expensive hardware will change the dynamics of the existing public safety market, enabling the creation of increasingly robust networks with cameras at more locations. In addition, we expect the cost advantages and high degree of accuracy to create competitive advantages compared to electronic tolling systems and logistics operations that currently rely on RFID systems. We also believe our lower costs, our distance and field of view capabilities and the ability to capture additional vehicle information, such as vehicle direction and color, make and type of vehicle, have opened opportunities in other market segments such as parking operations, school safety, retail customer loyalty programs and particularly smart cities and smart roadways. Smart roadway systems, sometimes referred to as smart transport\u201d or intelligent transport systems\u201d ( ITS\u201d), inclusive of parking management and guidance, passenger information, and traffic management systems, can optimize the movement of vehicles to make travel safer and more efficient. These technologies are expected to enable users to be more coordinated, better informed, and make safer and smarter use of transport networks.\nOur vision is AI with a Purpose.\u201d We intend to evolve beyond vehicle recognition for public safety markets into the recognition and analysis of vehicles activities (inclusive of motion and behaviors) to identify unsafe situations (e.g. wrong way driving, pedestrian on roadway, etc.), optimize traffic flows, and develop numerous other data driven applications centered around vehicle knowledge.\nProfessional Services Segment. We provide professional services and staffing solutions to the government contracting and the aerospace and aviation industries. The Professional Services Segment includes AOC Key Solutions, Inc. ( AOC Key Solutions\u201d); Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d); Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP\u201d, and together with GTS, Global\u201d); and Firestorm Solutions, LLC (Firestorm Solutions\u201d) and Firestorm Franchising, LLC ( Firestorm Franchising\u201d and together with Firestorm Solutions, Firestorm\u201d). Currently, as a leading provider of support services to the federal government contracting market, AOC Key Solutions' primary clients are companies that serve the federal government. However, in support of our Technology Segment, we have recently been active in the state and local government contracting market. We provide professional services that offer scalable and compliant outsourced support for our government contractor clients. We help these clients to win government contracts so that they capture new businesses. Global provides specialized staffing services, primarily in the aerospace and aviation industries. In connection with our internal reorganization, we are actively engaged in evaluating, reconfiguring, selling, and discontinuing various business assets or entities in the Professional Services Segment. As part of this process, we have discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising and have determined to sell Global and AOC Key Solutions.\nAs part of our strategic shift in fiscal year 2019, we are focusing on the Technology Segment and further developing our footprint across different industries by further developing our AI based technologies and distributing and licensing products and services with advanced vehicle recognition features. Current customers are using these products and services for: a) toll collection and traffic analysis in the transportation market, b) school and traffic safety, parking and other law enforcement applications in the public safety market, c) perimeter management and surveillance in the private security market, d) operations and retail customer loyalty programs and e) vehicle tracking, perimeter security and warehouse operations in the logistics market.\nAs a result of our strategic shift, during the third quarter of 2019, we began to separately report the results of Global and considered including substantially all of the assets and liabilities comprising Global as held for sale operations. We are also reporting the operating results and cash flows of Global as held for sale operations, and thus they have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter of 2019, the operating results for Global were presented in the Professional Services segment. The assets and liabilities of Global are presented as current and long-term assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Since we adopted a formal plan to sell Global in September 2019, we have received several non-binding offers and indications of interest for the purchase of Global which we are in the process of evaluating. In March of 2020, we also received a proposal from the current management of AOC Key Solutions to purchase that subsidiary, which we are also currently evaluating. No assurance can be given as to the certainty of the entry into, or the subsequent closing any of these, proposed transactions.\nGeneral\nThe information provided in this discussion and analysis of Rekor's financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During 2019 the Company completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition as more fully described below.\nOur financial results are impacted principally by the demand by clients for our products and services, the degree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities and the success of our sales team in generating client engagements.\nUnexpected changes in the demand for our products and services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.\nThe statements of operations and other information provided in this discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Rekor should be read in conjunction with the Rekor audited consolidated financial statements and the historical financial statements of Rekor Recognition, KeyStone, Firestorm and Global, and the related notes thereto which were filed with the SEC by either KeyStone or Rekor.\nAcquisitions\nOn March 12, 2019, we completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition.\nOn June 1, 2019, we sold all the interest we had acquired in Secure Education Consultants, LLC, which we acquired on January 1, 2018. At that time, we also discontinued operations of BC Management. In connection with these actions we recognized a write-off of intangible assets of $242,000. In addition, in June 2019, we discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising, resulting in a write-off of an additional $1,310,000 in intangible assets related to Firestorm.\nOpportunities, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe look to identify the various trends, market cycles, uncertainties and other factors that may provide us with opportunities and present challenges that impact our operations and financial condition from time to time. Although there are many that we may not or cannot foresee, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be primarily affected by the following:\n\u25cf\nAI for the Roadway - We believe that the application of AI to the analysis roadway condition will significantly affect vehicular travel in the future by assisting in the intelligent optimization of traffic flows and the identification of anomalous and unsafe movements - e.g. wrong way, stopped vehicle, pedestrian on the roadway. Marketers and drive-thru retailers with loyalty programs can benefit from the rapid identification of existing and potential customers and streamlining vehicular flow.\n\u25cf\nGraphic Processing Unit ( GPU\u201d) Improvements - We expect our business to benefit as a result of more powerful and affordable GPU hardware that has recently been developed. These GPUs are more efficient for image processing because their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central procession units ( CPUs\u201d) for algorithms that process large blocks of data, such as those produced by video streams. GPUs also provide superior memory bandwidth and efficiencies as compared to their CPU counterparts. The most recent versions of our software have been designed to use the increased GPU speeds to accelerate image recognitions. The GPU market is predicted to grow as a result of a surge in adoption of the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) by the industrial and automotive sectors. As GPU manufacturers increase production volume, we hope to benefit from the reduced cost to manufacture the hardware included in our products or available to others using our services.\n\u25cf\nAdaptability of the Current ALPR Market - We have made a considerable investment in our advanced vehicle recognition systems because we believe their increased accuracy and affordability will allow them to compete effectively with existing providers. Based on published benchmarks, our software currently outperforms competitors in almost every metric. However, large users of existing ALPR Technology, such as toll roads, have long-term contracts with service providers that have made considerable investments in their existing technologies and may not consider the improvements in accuracy or reductions in cost sufficient to justify abandoning their current systems in the near future. In addition, existing providers may be able to reduce the cost of their current offerings or elect to reduce prices and accept reduced profitability while working to develop or secure their own advanced vehicle recognition systems. As a result, our success in establishing a major position in these markets will depend on being able to effectively communicate our presence, develop strong customer relationships, and maintain leadership in providing the capabilities that customers want. As with any large market, this will require considerable effort and resources.\n\u25cf\nNew and Expanded Uses for Vehicle Recognition Systems - We believe that reductions in the cost of vehicle recognition products and services will significantly broaden the market for these systems. We currently serve a number of users who could not afford the cost or adapt to, the restrictions of conventional vehicle recognition systems. These include smaller municipalities, homeowners' associations, and organizations finding new applications such as innovative customer loyalty programs. We have seen and responded to an increase in the number of smaller jurisdictions and municipalities that are testing ALPR systems or that issued requests for proposals to install a network of ALPR cameras. We also expect the availability of faster, higher accuracy, lower cost systems to dramatically increase the ability of crowded urban areas to manage traffic congestion and implement smart city programs. We do not currently have the resources to develop all of these entirely new markets by ourselves, so we will need to rely on affiliations with other partners, who may or may not realize the significant benefits that we envision from these new uses.\n\u25cf\nExpansion of Automated Enforcement of Motor Vehicle Laws - We believe that future legislation will allow for auto enforcement of motor vehicle regulations to be expanded as the types of violations authorized for automated enforcement increase and experience provides localities with a better understanding of the circumstances where automated enforcement is beneficial. For example, there are now 17 states that allow for the automatic enforcement of violations by vehicles that pass a school bus displaying its flashing red lights and a stop sign. In addition, due to high rates of fatalities and injuries to law enforcement and other emergency response crews on roadsides, several states are considering authorizing automated enforcement of violations where motorists fail to slow down and/or move over for emergency responders and law enforcement vehicles at the side of the road. Legislative implementation is a deliberative and necessarily time-consuming process. However, as states expand auto enforcement, the market for our products and services should increase and broaden in the public safety market\n\u25cf\nIncreasing Smart City Market - Nokia has approved the use of our OpenALPR software for its smart city offerings. According to a research report Smart Cities Market by Smart Transportation (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Buildings (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Utilities (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Citizen Services, and Region - Global Forecast to 2023\u201d), published by Markets and Markets, the global market for smart city technology is expected to grow from $308.0 billion in 2018 to $717.2 billion by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate of 18.4% during the forecast period. In the smart city's market, real-time vehicle recognition technologies are widely used for traffic management and public safety. As a result, we expect to benefit from the growth of this market.\n\u25cf\nAccelerated Business Development and Marketing - Our ability to compete in a large, competitive and rapidly evolving industry will require us to achieve and maintain a leadership position. As a result, we have accelerated our business development and marketing activities within the Technology Segment to increase awareness and market adoption of our new technology and products within the market. However, the speed at which these markets grow to the degree of which our products and services are adopted is uncertain.\n\u25cf\nAbility to Scale and Balance Production to Meet Demand - While we have arranged manufacturing capabilities for our products, we are unproven in our ability to deliver large volumes of products at our high-quality standards.\n\u25cf\nSales Cycle - As many of our products are new to market, their acceptance and integration into the intended markets is uncertain and we do not have sufficient historical experience to accurately predict revenues as a result of their implementation.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Government Spending - In July 2019, the White House and bi-partisan congressional negotiators announced they had reached agreement on a two-year federal budget. The proposed plan would raise federal spending by $320 billion over existing caps previously imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Absent a new agreement, earlier legislation would have automatically triggered deep spending cuts next year under a process known as sequestration. Instead, the agreement allowed the government to continue to borrow and increased spending on domestic and military programs, partially funded by $77.4 billion in spending cuts from other budget categories. On August 2, 2019, the President signed the two-year budget agreement which wards off automatic spending cuts and suspends the debt ceiling through July 2021. Agreement on the July spending plan is intended to result in more funding consistency and may reduce the possibility of another government shutdown until after the 2020 elections. Many contractors have geared up for the anticipated increases in spending. We believe this agreement will reduce government spending seasonality and this has begun to lead to a stronger fourth quarter in 2019 and a more robust first quarter in 2020.\nWe believe that recent developments in computing capabilities, such as GPU advances, and new techniques of analysis, sometimes referred to broadly as AI, have broadened the market for vehicle recognition technology and created new opportunities in existing markets. With our new line of products and services, our Technology Segment is working to actively exploit these opportunities. With the anticipated continuation of a stable economic outlook for the government contracting, we believe that the outlook for the operations of our subsidiaries in the Professional Services Segment remains positive.\nConsiderable uncertainty currently exists concerning the extent of spread, efficaciousness of countermeasures and severity of the economic impact of the Covid19 corona virus. This has had, and may continue to have, a severe impact on the financial markets that we depend on to fund our operations. If these economic and market conditions continue for an extended period of time, it could have a significant impact on our financial performance and ability to execute our business strategy. Other than as described above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nNeoSystems Merger\nWe filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on January 25, 2018. A significant portion of the proceeds from the proposed offering were to be used for the planned acquisition of NeoSystems LLC ( NeoSystems\u201d) under a merger agreement. On March 7, 2018, we received notice of termination of the merger agreement and subsequently paid NeoSystems $225,000 in required payments, which was recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2018. No securities were sold in connection with the offering contemplated by the Registration Statement on Form S-1 and it was withdrawn on November 26, 2018.\nSale of Note\nOn February 13, 2018, Rekor Recognition sold a note receivable from Global Public Safety, LLC ( Global Public Safety\u201d), which it had received as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the sale of its legacy upfitting business prior to its acquisition by Rekor as a result of the merger with KeyStone in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, based on the decision to sell the note receivable to an unrelated third party, we reclassified the note receivable balance to a current asset and wrote down $450,000 as other expense, thus reducing the balance to $1,475,000. Rekor Recognition continues to retain a 19.9% interest in Global Public Safety.\nPromissory Notes\n2018 Promissory Note\nOn April 3, 2018, we entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor (the Lender\u201d) loaned $2,000,000 to us (the 2018 Promissory Note\u201d). The 2018 Promissory Note is discussed in further detail in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\n2019 Promissory Note\nOn March 12, 2019, we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which investors (the 2019 Lenders\u201d) loaned us $20,000,000 in exchange for promissory notes (the 2019 Promissory Notes\u201d) and we issued to the 2019 Lenders warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of our common stock (the March 2019 Warrants\u201d). The 2019 Lenders included the lender for the 2018 Note, a senior company executive and another entity exchanging 2019 Promissory Notes for related party company indebtedness. The 2019 Promissory Note and March 2019 Warrants are discussed in further detail this in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOther than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nOn November 1, 2018, we issued 4,125,000 shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $0.80 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $2.8 million. In addition, we granted underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 618,750 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotment, if any. The underwriters did not exercise this option and the options were cancelled. As part of this transaction, we also issued to the underwriter warrants to purchase an aggregate of 206,250 shares of common stock, exercisable over a period of five years, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The underwriter warrants had a value of approximately $0.2 million at issuance and are exercisable commencing April 27, 2019 and expire on October 29, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the underwriter's had 7,567 unexercised warrants which have an immaterial value.\nAt-the-Market Agreement\nOn August 14, 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR to create an at the market equity program under which we from time to time may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through or to B. Riley FBR. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, B. Riley FBR will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares of our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions. B. Riley FBR is entitled to a commission equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale. We incurred issuance costs of approximately $226,000 related to legal, accounting, and other fees in connection with the Sales Agreement. These costs were charged against the gross proceeds of the Sales Agreement and presented as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\nSales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement are to be issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No 333-224423), previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) on April 24, 2018 and declared effective by the SEC on April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, based on settlement date, we sold 1,292,730 shares of common stock at a weighted-average selling price of $2.53 per share in accordance with the Sales Agreement. Net cash provided from the Sales Agreement was $2,949,000 after paying $226,000 related to the issuance costs stated above, as well as 3.0% or $98,000 related to cash commissions provided to B. Riley FBR. As of December 31, 2019, $11,727,000 remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe generate our revenues substantially from two sources: (1) licensing and subscription revenues for software and related products and services and (2) professional services to clients.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products and services. If the consideration promised in the contract includes a variable amount, for example maintenance fees, we include an estimate of the amount we expect to receive in the total transaction price, if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nWe determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u25cf\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u25cf\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u25cf\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied\nThe subscription revenues from software licenses, technology products and services are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to the software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. During the second quarter of 2019, we changed our method of selling in the Technology Segment from perpetual software licenses to monthly service subscriptions. This change is expected to impact our revenue in the short term as we will now recognize revenue ratably over the contract period rather than at a point in time when the customer takes possession of the license. The amount of contract revenue received over the long term is not expected to decline. Our subscription services arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nThe professional services contracts recognize revenue based on a time and materials or fixed fees basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts, or ratably over the contact term for fixed price contracts with subscription services.\nCosts of Revenues\nDirect costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with revenue generating activities. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our revenue generating activities. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, sales and marketing and research and development. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses also include depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative departments. Additional expenses include travel and entertainment, professional fees and insurance.\nWe expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance and investor relations as a public company. However, we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, marketing programs, travel and entertainment associated with sales and marketing personnel, expenses for conferences and trade shows. We intend to make significant investments in our sales and marketing expenses to grow revenue, further penetrate the market and expand our customer base. With the release of our Partners Program we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in the future.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consists of personnel costs, software used to develop our products and consulting and professional fees for third-party development resources. Our research and development expenses support our efforts to continue to add capabilities to our existing products and the strategic shift to develop additional capabilities and improve our AI software.\nWe expect our research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of our AI software. However, we expect our research and development expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our research and development expense may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) net consists primarily of interest expense in connection with our debt arrangements, costs associated with the extinguishment of our debt arrangements, gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax provision consists primarily of income taxes in certain domestic jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have recorded deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance has been provided, including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance for the foreseeable future as it is more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets may not be realized based on our history of losses.\nResults of Operations\nThe results and the analysis of operations below is solely related to continuing operations and do not include results of operations of our subsidiary, Global, which is being held for sale. The following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with the foregoing information contained in this Item 7 and with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Only historical operating results are presented below.

As part of evaluating the future of Firestorm, management decided to sell Secure Education and transfer the BC Management line of business to its founder in the second quarter of 2019. In addition, management determined to discontinue the operation of Firestorm Franchising, LLC, a division of Firestorm, due to non-performance by franchisees. As further discussed under Item 3, Legal Proceedings\u201d, above, we have commenced an action to rescind the original purchase of Firestorm. As a result of these changes, the Professional Services Segment revenue was expected to decrease compared to the corresponding periods in 2018.\nAlso, in June 2019, our Board of Directors authorized the sale of Global. As a result, management has been negotiating with potential buyers and has determined that Global should be classified as held for sale. Accordingly, results of operations for Global have not been included in the comparisons shown below for either 2018 or 2019. The results for our Professional Services Segment are for AOC Key Solutions and Firestorm. In January 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the sale of AOC Key Solutions. Therefore, beginning in 2020, it is expected that all Professional Services operations will be classified as held for sale.\nRevenue\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td> $5,469\n</td> <td> $3,522\n</td> <td> $1,947\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional Services\n</td> <td> 13,851\n</td> <td> 16,532\n</td> <td> (2,681)\n</td> <td> -16%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue from continuing operations\n</td> <td> $19,320\n</td> <td> $20,054\n</td> <td> $(734)\n</td> <td> -4%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in revenue in the Technology Segment was primarily attributable to the acquisition of OpenALPR in March 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2019, total revenue attributable to software and licensing was approximately $2,055,000 compared to no revenue recognized in the corresponding period in 2018. For additional information concerning pro-forma revenues attributable to software and licensing see Technology Revenues\u201d below in this section and for information concerning pro-forma revenues attributable to software and licensing during 2018, see Note 2 to the financial statements included in this report. Revenue related to our automated traffic safety enforcement remained fairly consistent year over year.\nThe decrease in revenues in the Professional Services Segment was primarily attributable to the winding down of Firestorm operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue related to Firestorm decreased by $2,324,000 from $3,330,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1,006,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The additional decrease in revenue is attributable to a decrease in revenue at AOC Key Solutions related mainly to the federal government furlough during the first quarter of 2019.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nTable 7: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ or % Points\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td> $1,652\n</td> <td> $1,642\n</td> <td> $10\n</td> <td> 1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional Services\n</td> <td> 7,406\n</td> <td> 8,336\n</td> <td> (930)\n</td> <td> -11%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td> 9,058\n</td> <td> 9,978\n</td> <td> (920)\n</td> <td> -9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td> 3,817\n</td> <td> 1,880\n</td> <td> 1,937\n</td> <td> 103%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional Services\n</td> <td> 6,445\n</td> <td> 8,196\n</td> <td> (1,751)\n</td> <td> -21%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> $10,262\n</td> <td> $10,076\n</td> <td> $186\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Technology\n</td> <td> 70%\n</td> <td> 53%\n</td> <td> 17%\n</td> <td> 32%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional Services\n</td> <td> 47%\n</td> <td> 50%\n</td> <td> -3%\n</td> <td> -6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> 53%\n</td> <td> 50%\n</td> <td> 3%\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross profit in the Technology Segment was primarily attributable to the inclusion of OpenALPR since its acquisition in March 2019. We realize higher margins from the revenues associated with software and licensing since there are less labor costs incurred.\nThe decrease in the cost of revenues and gross profit in the Professional Services Segment was primarily related to the winding down of Firestorm lines of business and also reflected a decrease in direct billable labor as a result of the federal government furlough. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the cost of revenue and gross profit associated with Firestorm decreased $758,000 and $1,567,000, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td> $14,151\n</td> <td> $13,310\n</td> <td> $841\n</td> <td> 6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling and marketing expenses\n</td> <td> 2,222\n</td> <td> 1,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development expenses\n</td> <td> 1,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,298\n</td> <td> 991%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangibles\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 1,549\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td> $19,351\n</td> <td> $15,199\n</td> <td> $4,152\n</td> <td> 27%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, amortization expenses related to intangible assets increased by $570,000 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition. The majority of the remaining increase to general and administrative expenses is attributable mainly to the increased staffing to support the Company's growth plan in the Technology Segment.\nSelling and Marketing Expenses\nThe increase in the selling and marketing expenses during the year is attributable mainly to the increased marketing efforts to promote our products and services including trade shows, digital marketing, and other sales and marketing activities for developing our Technology Segment and increase staffing to support the Company's growth plan. The overall increase in selling and marketing expenses was partially offset by a decrease in selling and marketing expenses related to the Professional Services Segment due to the realignment of Firestorm in the current year.\nResearch and Development Expense\nThe overall increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to the strategic shift to develop new products and additional software capabilities in 2019, as a result of our increased focus on the Technology Segment. The increase in our research and development expenses is mainly attributable to an increase in headcount and hours associated with the research and development activities.\nImpairment of Intangibles\nIn June 2019, we discontinued the operations of BC Management and terminated agreements of all franchisees of Firestorm Franchising, LLC. As a result, we reevaluated the intangible assets related to these subsidiaries and recognized $1,549,000 in impairment charges related to intangible assets. The loss is presented as impairment of intangibles on the consolidated statement of operations.\nOther Expense\nTable 9: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> $(1,158)\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> <td> $(1,158)\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> (4,098)\n</td> <td> (492)\n</td> <td> (3,606)\n</td> <td> -733%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td> (20)\n</td> <td> (65)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense\n</td> <td> $(5,276)\n</td> <td> $(557)\n</td> <td> $(4,719)\n</td> <td> 847%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in other expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense related to the 2019 Promissory Note. Additionally, the increase in other expenses was attributable to costs associated with the extinguishment of debt of $1,158,000 during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $47,000, is due primarily to the state taxes, as compared to tax expense of $29,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. There is also approximately $10,000 of deferred taxes related to the goodwill recognized related to the OpenALPR acquisition. We established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 and have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance through the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe calculate EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for (i) impairment of intangible assets, (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (iii) stock-based compensation, (iv) losses on sales of subsidiaries, and (v) other unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of financial performance or liquidity under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of our operating performance or as a measure of liquidity or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company's ability to service and/or incur debt. However, other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.\nThe following table sets forth the components of the EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods included (dollars in thousands):\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> $(14,412)\n</td> <td> $(5,709)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td> 4,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> 1,867\n</td> <td> 1,047\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> $(8,400)\n</td> <td> $(4,138)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of intangible assets\n</td> <td> $1,549\n</td> <td> $-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> 1,158\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on sale of Secure Education\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> $(4,911)\n</td> <td> $(3,673)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following activities have impacted our Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as of December 31, 2019. In March 2019, we recorded costs in connection with the extinguishment of the $2,000,000 2018 Promissory Note of $1,113,000. In July 2019, we recorded costs in connection with the extinguishment of our line of credit with Wells Fargo of $45,000. In June we initiated restructuring and transition activities to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs and better position us to drive future revenue growth. In connection with these activities, we recorded $333,000 of charges related to these restructuring activities. Additionally, in June 2019, we discontinued the operations of BC Management and terminated agreements of all franchisees of Firestorm Franchising, LLC. As a result, we re-evaluated the intangible assets related to these subsidiaries and recognized $1,549,000 in impairment charges related to intangible assets.\nTechnology Revenues\nDue to the strategic shift to focus more on our Technology Segment, we have used additional metrics to measure the revenue growth associated with our Technology Segment. We calculated our Pro-forma Technology Segment revenue to include the net sales of OpenALPR Technology, Inc., as if the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition occurred as of December 31, 2017. This amount is presented as we believe comparative segment revenue growth is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of a company's ability to grow.\nThe following table sets forth the components of the per-forma Technology Segment revenue (without the inclusion of OpenALPR revenue prior to the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition) and pro-forma Technology Segment revenue (with the inclusion of OpenALPR revenue prior to the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition) for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Per-forma Technology Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automated traffic safety enforcement\n</td> <td> $3,403\n</td> <td> $3,413\n</td> <td> $(10)\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing and subscription revenue\n</td> <td> 2,066\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> 2,066\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (109)\n</td> <td> -100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Per-forma Technology Segment Revenue\n</td> <td> $5,469\n</td> <td> $3,522\n</td> <td> $1,947\n</td> <td> 55%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pro-forma Technology Segment Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automated traffic safety enforcement\n</td> <td> $3,403\n</td> <td> $3,413\n</td> <td> $(10)\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Licensing and subscription revenue\n</td> <td> 3,035\n</td> <td> 1,713\n</td> <td> 1,322\n</td> <td> 78%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (109)\n</td> <td> -100%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pro-forma Technology Segment Revenue\n</td> <td> $6,438\n</td> <td> $5,235\n</td> <td> $1,203\n</td> <td> 23.0%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following activities have impacted our Technology Segment revenues as of December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, we began to implement a change in our sales model from perpetual software licenses to periodic service subscriptions. Under the perpetual license model, we generally received full payment for a license when the license was issued and we would receive significantly lower periodic payments subsequently for maintenance of the license. Under the perpetual license model, all the revenue associated with a software license was recognized upon the issuance of the license, which was typically contemporaneous with cash payment. Under our new subscription model, the revenue is now recognized ratably against a contract liability for the paid-for period of the software subscription. Subscriptions are typically for 36 or 60 months, while payments may be made monthly, yearly or entirely in advance. This change to the model has resulted in a $1,317,000 increase in our contract liabilities balance from $207,000 as of December 31, 2018 to $1,524,000 as of December 31, 2019.\nLease Obligations\nAt December 31, 2019, we leased building space at the following locations in the U.S.:\n\u25cf\nColumbia, Maryland - The corporate headquarters\n\u25cf\nLinthicum, Maryland - Storage facility for inventory related to our technology hardware\n\u25cf\nChantilly, Virginia - The corporate office of AOC Key Solution\n\u25cf\nFort Worth, Texas - The corporate office of Global entities\nWe believe our facilities are in good condition and adequate for their current use. We may improve, replace or reduce facilities as considered appropriate to meet the needs of our operations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods below were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities-continuing operations\n</td> <td> $(11,767)\n</td> <td> $(3,076)\n</td> <td> $(8,691)\n</td> <td> 283%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities - continuing operations\n</td> <td> (556)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,028)\n</td> <td> -218%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities-continuing operations\n</td> <td> 11,639\n</td> <td> 2,409\n</td> <td> 9,230\n</td> <td> 383%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents- continuing operations\n</td> <td> $(684)\n</td> <td> (195)\n</td> <td> $(489)\n</td> <td> 251%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities - continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $8,691,000 which was primarily due to an increase in net loss from continuing operations to $14,412,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5,709,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019 there was $5,101,000 of cash outflows related to the change in accounts receivable compared to a $733,000 cash inflow as of December 31, 2018. This change is related to the timing of our collections. These cash outflows were partially offset by (i) an impairment of intangible assets in the amount of $1,549,000 from Firestorm, (ii) $1,158,000 loss on extinguishment of debt we incurred in the first and third quarter of 2019, (iii) an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $1,308,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $738,000 in the year ended December 31, 2018, (iv) an increase in amortization of deferred financing costs of $1,101,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $94,000 in the year ended December 31, 2018, and (v) an increase in contract liabilities of $929,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a $22,000 increase in the year ended December 31, 2018, mainly a result of $800,000 we received from a customer for a five-year software license.\nThe net decrease of net cash (used in) provided by investment activities - continuing operations of $1,028,000 was primarily due to proceeds from sale of note receivable in the amount of $1,475,000 received during the year ended December 31, 2018. This was partially offset by proceeds of $250,000 from the sale of Secure Education to a third party and a reduction in capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNet cash provided by financing activities - continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $9,230,000 from the prior year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to (i) proceeds of $3,839,000 from the 2019 Promissory Notes, (ii) proceeds of $2,949,000 from sale of the Company common stock through the at-the-market agreement, and (iii) proceeds of $5,463,000 from the secured borrowing arrangement with LSQ Funding Group, L.C. ( LSQ\u201d). This was partially offset by the repayment of the Wells Fargo line of credit.\nDuring 2019 and 2018, we funded our operations primarily through cash from operating activities from our subsidiaries, secured borrowing arrangements, issuance of debt, and the sale of equity. As of December 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations of $1,180,000 and working capital deficit of $912,000, as compared to unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $2,069,000 and working capital deficit of $44,000 as of December 31, 2018.\nWe believe our existing cash and net cash flow will fund our operations over the next twelve months.\nOperating assets and liabilities consist primarily of receivables from billed and unbilled services, accounts payable, accrued expenses, current portion of long-term debt and secured borrowing arrangements, and accrued payroll and related benefits. The volume of billings and timing of collections and payments affect these account balances.\nAt December 31, 2019, within the Technology Segment, we had approximately $10,102,000 of licensing and subscription contracts that were closed prior to December 31, 2019, but, have a contractual subscription period beyond December 31, 2019. These subscription contracts generally cover a term of one to five years, in which the Company will recognize revenue ratably over the contract term. On occasion our customers will prepay the full contract or a substantial portion of the contract. Amounts related to the prepayment of the subscription contract for a service period that is not yet met are recorded as part of our contract liabilities balance. We currently expect to recognize approximately 46% of this amount over the succeeding twelve months, and the remainder is expected to be recognized over the following four years.\nAt March 20, 2020, within the Technology Segment, we had approximately $13,833,000 of licensing and subscription contracts that were closed prior to March 20, 2020, but, have a contractual subscription period beyond March 20, 2020. The table below represents growth from December 31, 2018, or 105% and 181% through December 31, 2019 and March 20, 2020, respectively.\nThe table below shows the quarter by quarter growth in the unaudited remaining contract value of licensing and subscription contracts in the Technology Segment (dollars in thousands):\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nThe holders of Rekor Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.175 (7% per annum) per share. Dividends accrue quarterly and dividend payments for declared dividends are due within five business days following the end of a quarter.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid cash dividends of $0 and $264,000, respectively, to shareholders of record of Series A Preferred Stock. Accrued dividends payable to Series A Preferred Stock shareholders were $551,000 and $176,000 as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and are presented as part of the accounts payables and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\nAs part of the acquisition of Global, we issued 240,861 shares of $0.0001 par value Series B Preferred Stock. All Series B Preferred Stock was issued at a price of $10.00 per share with a conversion price of $5.00 per share. Each Series B Preferred Stock has an automatic conversion feature based on our common stock share price. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to quarterly cash dividends of 1.121% (4.484% per annum) per share. Dividends accrue quarterly and dividend payments for declared dividends are due within five business days following the end of a quarter. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we paid cash dividends of $108,000 and $81,000, respectively, related to accrued dividends for Series B Preferred Stock shareholders. Accrued dividends payable to Series B Preferred Stock shareholders were $54,000 as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nShort-Term Borrowing\nOn August 9, 2019, our wholly owned subsidiaries, Global Technical Services, Inc. and Global Contract Professionals, Inc, (together \"Global\"), entered an agreement with an unrelated third party, LSQ, pursuant to which Global sells its accounts receivable to LSQ and LSQ advances Global 90% of the value of the receivable. Global can advance up to $10,000,000 at one time. The term of the agreement is for 12 months and automatically renews for additional 12-month periods. The agreement is presented as secured borrowings, as the accounts receivable are sold with recourse back to Global, meaning that Global bears the risk of non-payment by the account debtor. The funded amount of accounts receivables that LSQ has provided to Global was $1,842,000 as of December 31, 2019 and is presented as part of current liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets. To secure its obligations to LSQ, Global has granted a first priority security interest in Global's accounts receivable and proceeds thereof. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately $2,455,000 of receivables that are subject to collateral as part of this agreement. The receivables held as collateral are presented in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn August 9, 2019, AOC Key Solutions, also entered into an agreement with LSQ, as an unrelated third party, pursuant to which AOC Key Solutions sells its accounts receivable to LSQ and LSQ advances 90% of the value of the receivable to AOC Key Solutions. AOC Key Solutions can advance up to $5,000,000 at one time. The term of the agreement is for 12 months and automatically renews for additional 12-month periods. The agreement is presented as secured borrowings, as the accounts receivable are sold with recourse back to AOC Key Solutions, meaning that AOC Key Solutions bears the risk of non-payment by the account debtor. The funded amount of accounts receivables that LSQ has provided fund to AOC Key Solutions was $1,894,000 as of December 31, 2019 and is presented as part of the short-term borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets. To secure its obligations to LSQ, AOC Key Solutions has granted a first priority security interest in the AOC Key Solution's accounts receivable and proceeds thereof. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately $2,714,000 of receivables that are subject to collateral as part of this agreement. The receivables held as collateral are presented in the accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $112,000, in interest expense from continuing operations, related to the agreement with LSQ. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $169,000 in interest expense from operations held for sale, related to the agreement with LSQ.\nPromissory Notes\nOn March 12, 2019, we issued the 2019 Promissory Notes and the March 2019 Warrants. The loan was due and payable on March 11, 2021. In March 2020, we received an extension of the maturity date of the loan until June 12, 2021. The loan bears interest at 16% per annum, of which at least 10% per annum is required to be paid in cash. The full remaining portion of all interest, if any, accrues and is to be paid-in-kind. The notes also require a premium, if paid before the maturity date, a $1,000,000 exit fee due at maturity, and compliance with affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The covenants related to this note were deferred until June 2020. Transaction costs were approximately $403,000 for a work fee payable over 10 months, $290,000 in legal fees and a $200,000 closing fee. The loan is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of Rekor. The March 2019 Warrants are exercisable over a period of five years, at an exercise price of $0.74 per share, and are valued at $706,000. The warrants were exercisable commencing March 12, 2019 and expire on March 12, 2024. The 2019 Promissory Notes have an effective interest rate of 24.87%. On March 12, 2019, we retired the entire $500,000 balance due on a promissory note issued under a March 16, 2016 Subordinated Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Avon Road Partners, L.P. ( Avon Road\u201d), an affiliate of Robert Berman, Rekor's President and CEO and a member of our Board of Directors. Under this agreement, we also issued to Avon Road, warrants to purchase 121,247 shares of our common stock. These warrants were exercised on December 11, 2017 for proceeds of $125,000 and none of these warrants were outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The promissory note to Avon Road was extinguished on March 12, 2019 from proceeds of the 2019 Promissory Notes. Amortized financing cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,101,000 and is included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe 2019 Promissory Notes resulting in the following detailed transaction (dollars in thousands):\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td> Financing:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable, includes exit fee\n</td> <td> $21,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt discount financing costs\n</td> <td> (2,599)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> (1,113)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repayment of notes payable and interest expense, net of debt discount\n</td> <td> (2,515)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment in OpenALPR Technology, includes $7,000,000 cash paid and $5,000,000 note assumed by seller\n</td> <td> (12,000)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuance of warrants in conjunction with notes payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accounts Payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash proceeds from notes payable\n</td> <td> $3,839\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, Rekor did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.\nBalance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon Rekor's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the management of Rekor to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe the application of accounting policies, and the estimates inherently required therein, are reasonable. These accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated, and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change. Rekor bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management of Rekor believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form management's basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.\nRekor's accounting policies are further described in its historical audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Rekor has identified the following critical accounting policies:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate our revenues substantially from two sources: (1) licensing and subscription revenues for software and related technology products and services and (2) professional services to clients. Some of our revenues are subject to seasonal variation, as more fully described in Seasonality\u201d below.\nIn some cases, we have sold software on a long term license basis, that includes continuing opportunities to contract for maintenance and support at a relatively low periodic cost. In connection with such sales, we have deferred revenue recognition to spread it over the expected life of the contract and have established a contract liability associated with the contract. Our current sales model is oriented toward subscription sales.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products and services. If the consideration promised in the contract includes a variable amount, for example maintenance fees, we include an estimate of the amount we expect to receive in the total transaction price, if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nThe revenues for technology products and services are from fees that provide customers with software licenses and related support. During the second quarter of 2019, we changed our method of selling in the Technology Segment from perpetual software licenses, with associated maintenance services, to service subscriptions of limited duration. These subscriptions give the customer a license to use the latest version of the software only during the term of the subscription. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. This change has impacted our revenue in the short term. However, the amount of contract revenue received over the long term is not expected to be reduced. Our subscription services arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nThe professional services contracts recognize revenue based on a time and materials or fixed fees basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts, or ratably over the contact term for fixed price contracts with subscription services.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of its clients' financial condition, and we generally do not require collateral.\nManagement reviews accounts receivable to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectible. Factors considered in the determination include, among other factors, number of days an invoice is past due, client historical trends, available credit rating information, other financial data and the overall economic environment. Collection agencies may also be used if management so determines.\nWe record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that are believed to be uncollectible. We also record as an additional allowance a certain percentage of aged accounts receivable, based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial conditions affecting its customer base. If actual collection experience changes, revisions to the allowance may be required. After all reasonable attempts to collect an account receivable have failed, the amount of the receivable is written off against the allowance. The balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts was $48,000 and $24,000 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively and related to the Professional Services Segment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes. This method requires an asset and liability approach for the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nManagement has evaluated the recoverability of the net deferred income tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance required with respect to such net deferred income tax assets. After considering all available facts, we fully reserved for our net deferred tax assets because management believes that it is more likely than not that their benefits will not be realized in future periods. We will continue to evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine whether any changes in circumstances could affect the realization of their future benefit. If it is determined in future periods that portions of the net deferred income tax assets satisfy the realization standard, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly.\nThe tax effects of uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. It is our accounting policy to account for Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 740-10-25-related penalties and interest as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, and 2018, our evaluation revealed no uncertain tax positions that would have a material impact on the financial statements. The 2016 through 2018 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS, as of December 31, 2019. Our management does not believe that any reasonably possible changes will occur within the next twelve months that will have a material impact on the financial statements.\nGoing Concern and Management's Plan\nBeginning with the year ended December 31, 2018 and all annual and interim periods thereafter, we will assess going concern uncertainty in our consolidated financial statements to determine whether there is sufficient cash on hand and working capital, including available borrowings on loans and external bank lines of credit, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued or available to be issued, which is referred to as the look-forward period\u201d, as defined in GAAP. As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to us, we will consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections, estimates and will make certain key assumptions, including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, our ability to delay or curtail expenditures or programs and our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, among other factors. Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, we make certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays in the nature and timing of programs and expenditures to the extent we deem probable that those implementations can be achieved and that we have the proper authority to execute them within the look-forward period.\nWe have generated losses since inception in February 2017 and have relied on cash on hand, external bank lines of credit, the sale of notes, debt financing and sales of common stock to support cashflow from operations. We attribute losses to restructuring and merger costs, public company corporate overhead and non-capital expenditures consequent to our change in strategic direction. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $14,412,000 and a working capital deficit of $912,000. The cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents position was decreased by $684,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the net loss from operations, offset by the net proceeds of $3,839,000 from senior secured notes, the net proceeds of $2,949,000 from the At-the-Market Agreement and the net proceeds from the secured borrowing arrangement of $5,463,000.\nWe believe that based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable, our current forecasts and projections, for one year from the date of the filing of the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, indicate our ability to continue operations as a going concern for that one-year period. We are actively monitoring our operations, the cash on hand and working capital. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, we believe we have access to raise up to $11,727,000 through the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement\u201d). As of March 30, 2020, we have $9,655,000 available for sale under the Sales Agreement. We will continue to raise capital through the Sales Agreement to help fund operations. Should access to those funds be unavailable, we will need to seek out additional sources of funding. Furthermore, we have contingency plans to reduce or defer expenses and cash outlays should operations weaken in the look-forward period or additional financing, if needed, is not available.\nOur ability to generate positive operating results and complete the execution of our business strategy will depend on (i) our ability to maintain timely collections from existing customers in, as well as continue the growth of, our Technology Segment, (ii) timely completion of the disposition of the businesses in our Professional Services Segment, (iii) the continued performance of our contractors, subcontractors and vendors, (iv) our ability to maintain and build good relationships with our lenders and financial intermediaries, (v) our ability to meet debt covenants or obtain waivers in case of noncompliance and (vi) the stability of the world economy and global financial markets. To the extent that events outside of our control have a significant negative impact on economic and/or market conditions, they could affect payments from customers, services and supplies from vendors, our ability to continue to secure new business, raise capital, complete the sale of our assets held for sale in a timely fashion and otherwise, depending on the severity of such impact, materially adversely affect our operating results.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Item 8 of Part II, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1 - Business and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of Rekor Systems, Inc., a leader in AI-driven advanced vehicle identification and management systems.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report and the historical financial statements of Rekor Systems, Inc., and the related notes thereto.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the field of advanced vehicle identification and management systems driven by leading edge advances in artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). In development for over five years using AI processes, including machine learning algorithms, our core software enables the creation of more powerful and capable vehicle recognition systems that can be deployed at a fraction of the cost of traditional vehicle recognition systems. The software enables a wider field of view, greater light sensitivity, recognitions at faster speeds and higher accuracy rates, in addition to the ability to identify the color, make and type of a vehicle and its direction of travel. These capabilities are particularly useful in solving a wide variety of real-world roadway and vehicle related challenges. In addition, the reductions in cost have opened up a number of new uses for vehicle recognition technology that were not previously cost effective. We currently provide products and services for governmental organizations, for large and small businesses and for individuals throughout the world. Customers are currently using our products or services in over 70 countries, with offerings for smart cities, public safety, security, transportation, parking and logistics.\nCurrently, our business activities include providing professional services in the government contracting, aerospace and aviation industries. As part of the development of a new line of products for the public safety and security markets, we acquired industry leading vehicle recognition software in March 2019. In connection with this acquisition, we determined that our resources are best concentrated on vehicle recognition products and services and have reorganized and retooled our product development, business development and administrative resources, with increasing emphasis on the technology area. Our Board of Directors has also authorized management to explore opportunities for the sale of our professional services businesses. In keeping with the shift in resources and strategic direction that this represents, we have reorganized our financial reporting into two business segments: the Technology Segment and the Professional Services Segment. These two segments reflect our separate focus on and expectations for technology products and services versus professional services.\nOn March 29, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved changing the Company's name to Rekor Systems, Inc. This name change was a result of our increased focus on technology products and services, and aligns with the renaming of Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. to Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. In connection with this name change, we changed:\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market to REKR\u201d and the CUSIP number for the common stock to 759419 104;\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for our Series A Preferred Stock on the OTC Markets OTCQB exchange to REKRP\u201d and the CUSIP number for our Series A Preferred Stock to 759419 203; and\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for warrants on the OTC Markets OTCQB exchange to REKRW\u201d and the CUSIP number for the warrants to 759419 112.\nTechnology Segment. The Technology Segment operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary, Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. ( Rekor Recognition\u201d). Formerly Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc., Rekor Recognition has been active in the public safety industry since 1996. In connection with the development of several new public safety products, we determined to acquire substantially all the assets of OpenALPR Technology, Inc. The OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, completed in March 2019, transferred vehicle recognition software and associated licenses and proprietary rights to OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC ( OpenALPR\u201d), a new wholly owned subsidiary of Rekor Recognition, as we have been focused on developing a line of products to transform the fundamental concepts of vehicle recognition. OpenALPR's vehicle recognition platform, already operating in more than 12,000 cameras in 70 countries worldwide, has laid the groundwork for the expansion of our product line, enabling multiple deployment mechanisms.\nSince the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, we have expanded our vehicle recognition product and service lines into a much broader range of customer segments, starting with public safety. We shifted from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription-based model, rebranded the software suites as Watchman\u201d and Car-Check\u201d and released several packaged hardware solutions with each of these vehicle recognition engines. By the end of 2019, we had a portfolio of more than 10 products, permitting us to offer full-scale vehicle recognition services for nearly any large or small public agency, commercial or residential setting.\nOur vehicle recognition software currently has the capability to analyze multi-spectral images and/or video streams produced by nearly any Internet Protocol security camera and concurrently extract license plate data by state from more than 70 countries, as well as provide the vehicle's make, color, type, and direction of travel. When combined with speed optimized code, parallel processing capability and best-in-class accessories, such as cameras and communications modules, Watchman software delivers vehicle recognition solutions at extremely high-capture rates and with a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, our multi-spectral capabilities enable reading of license plates and vehicle characteristics in unusually difficult conditions (e.g. low lighting, poor weather, extreme camera viewing angles, and obstructions).\nPrior to the development of our vehicle identification software, highly accurate results were not available using a typical Internet Protocol camera. We believe that the ability to use less expensive hardware will change the dynamics of the existing public safety market, enabling the creation of increasingly robust networks with cameras at more locations. In addition, we expect the cost advantages and high degree of accuracy to create competitive advantages compared to electronic tolling systems and logistics operations that currently rely on RFID systems. We also believe our lower costs, our distance and field of view capabilities and the ability to capture additional vehicle information, such as vehicle direction and color, make and type of vehicle, have opened opportunities in other market segments such as parking operations, school safety, retail customer loyalty programs and particularly smart cities and smart roadways. Smart roadway systems, sometimes referred to as smart transport\u201d or intelligent transport systems\u201d ( ITS\u201d), inclusive of parking management and guidance, passenger information, and traffic management systems, can optimize the movement of vehicles to make travel safer and more efficient. These technologies are expected to enable users to be more coordinated, better informed, and make safer and smarter use of transport networks.\nOur vision is AI with a Purpose.\u201d We intend to evolve beyond vehicle recognition for public safety markets into the recognition and analysis of vehicles activities (inclusive of motion and behaviors) to identify unsafe situations (e.g. wrong way driving, pedestrian on roadway, etc.), optimize traffic flows, and develop numerous other data driven applications centered around vehicle knowledge.\nProfessional Services Segment. We provide professional services and staffing solutions to the government contracting and the aerospace and aviation industries. The Professional Services Segment includes AOC Key Solutions, Inc. ( AOC Key Solutions\u201d); Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d); Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP\u201d, and together with GTS, Global\u201d); and Firestorm Solutions, LLC (Firestorm Solutions\u201d) and Firestorm Franchising, LLC ( Firestorm Franchising\u201d and together with Firestorm Solutions, Firestorm\u201d). Currently, as a leading provider of support services to the federal government contracting market, AOC Key Solutions' primary clients are companies that serve the federal government. However, in support of our Technology Segment, we have recently been active in the state and local government contracting market. We provide professional services that offer scalable and compliant outsourced support for our government contractor clients. We help these clients to win government contracts so that they capture new businesses. Global provides specialized staffing services, primarily in the aerospace and aviation industries. In connection with our internal reorganization, we are actively engaged in evaluating, reconfiguring, selling, and discontinuing various business assets or entities in the Professional Services Segment. As part of this process, we have discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising and have determined to sell Global and AOC Key Solutions.\nAs part of our strategic shift in fiscal year 2019, we are focusing on the Technology Segment and further developing our footprint across different industries by further developing our AI based technologies and distributing and licensing products and services with advanced vehicle recognition features. Current customers are using these products and services for: a) toll collection and traffic analysis in the transportation market, b) school and traffic safety, parking and other law enforcement applications in the public safety market, c) perimeter management and surveillance in the private security market, d) operations and retail customer loyalty programs and e) vehicle tracking, perimeter security and warehouse operations in the logistics market.\nAs a result of our strategic shift, during the third quarter of 2019, we began to separately report the results of Global and considered including substantially all of the assets and liabilities comprising Global as held for sale operations. We are also reporting the operating results and cash flows of Global as held for sale operations, and thus they have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter of 2019, the operating results for Global were presented in the Professional Services segment. The assets and liabilities of Global are presented as current and long-term assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Since we adopted a formal plan to sell Global in September 2019, we have received several non-binding offers and indications of interest for the purchase of Global which we are in the process of evaluating. In March of 2020, we also received a proposal from the current management of AOC Key Solutions to purchase that subsidiary, which we are also currently evaluating. No assurance can be given as to the certainty of the entry into, or the subsequent closing any of these, proposed transactions.\nGeneral\nThe information provided in this discussion and analysis of Rekor's financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During 2019 the Company completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition as more fully described below.\nOur financial results are impacted principally by the demand by clients for our products and services, the degree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities and the success of our sales team in generating client engagements.\nUnexpected changes in the demand for our products and services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.\nThe statements of operations and other information provided in this discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Rekor should be read in conjunction with the Rekor audited consolidated financial statements and the historical financial statements of Rekor Recognition, KeyStone, Firestorm and Global, and the related notes thereto which were filed with the SEC by either KeyStone or Rekor.\nAcquisitions\nOn March 12, 2019, we completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition.\nOn June 1, 2019, we sold all the interest we had acquired in Secure Education Consultants, LLC, which we acquired on January 1, 2018. At that time, we also discontinued operations of BC Management. In connection with these actions we recognized a write-off of intangible assets of $242,000. In addition, in June 2019, we discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising, resulting in a write-off of an additional $1,310,000 in intangible assets related to Firestorm.\nOpportunities, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe look to identify the various trends, market cycles, uncertainties and other factors that may provide us with opportunities and present challenges that impact our operations and financial condition from time to time. Although there are many that we may not or cannot foresee, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be primarily affected by the following:\n\u25cf\nAI for the Roadway - We believe that the application of AI to the analysis roadway condition will significantly affect vehicular travel in the future by assisting in the intelligent optimization of traffic flows and the identification of anomalous and unsafe movements - e.g. wrong way, stopped vehicle, pedestrian on the roadway. Marketers and drive-thru retailers with loyalty programs can benefit from the rapid identification of existing and potential customers and streamlining vehicular flow.\n\u25cf\nGraphic Processing Unit ( GPU\u201d) Improvements - We expect our business to benefit as a result of more powerful and affordable GPU hardware that has recently been developed. These GPUs are more efficient for image processing because their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central procession units ( CPUs\u201d) for algorithms that process large blocks of data, such as those produced by video streams. GPUs also provide superior memory bandwidth and efficiencies as compared to their CPU counterparts. The most recent versions of our software have been designed to use the increased GPU speeds to accelerate image recognitions. The GPU market is predicted to grow as a result of a surge in adoption of the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) by the industrial and automotive sectors. As GPU manufacturers increase production volume, we hope to benefit from the reduced cost to manufacture the hardware included in our products or available to others using our services.\n\u25cf\nAdaptability of the Current ALPR Market - We have made a considerable investment in our advanced vehicle recognition systems because we believe their increased accuracy and affordability will allow them to compete effectively with existing providers. Based on published benchmarks, our software currently outperforms competitors in almost every metric. However, large users of existing ALPR Technology, such as toll roads, have long-term contracts with service providers that have made considerable investments in their existing technologies and may not consider the improvements in accuracy or reductions in cost sufficient to justify abandoning their current systems in the near future. In addition, existing providers may be able to reduce the cost of their current offerings or elect to reduce prices and accept reduced profitability while working to develop or secure their own advanced vehicle recognition systems. As a result, our success in establishing a major position in these markets will depend on being able to effectively communicate our presence, develop strong customer relationships, and maintain leadership in providing the capabilities that customers want. As with any large market, this will require considerable effort and resources.\n\u25cf\nNew and Expanded Uses for Vehicle Recognition Systems - We believe that reductions in the cost of vehicle recognition products and services will significantly broaden the market for these systems. We currently serve a number of users who could not afford the cost or adapt to, the restrictions of conventional vehicle recognition systems. These include smaller municipalities, homeowners' associations, and organizations finding new applications such as innovative customer loyalty programs. We have seen and responded to an increase in the number of smaller jurisdictions and municipalities that are testing ALPR systems or that issued requests for proposals to install a network of ALPR cameras. We also expect the availability of faster, higher accuracy, lower cost systems to dramatically increase the ability of crowded urban areas to manage traffic congestion and implement smart city programs. We do not currently have the resources to develop all of these entirely new markets by ourselves, so we will need to rely on affiliations with other partners, who may or may not realize the significant benefits that we envision from these new uses.\n\u25cf\nExpansion of Automated Enforcement of Motor Vehicle Laws - We believe that future legislation will allow for auto enforcement of motor vehicle regulations to be expanded as the types of violations authorized for automated enforcement increase and experience provides localities with a better understanding of the circumstances where automated enforcement is beneficial. For example, there are now 17 states that allow for the automatic enforcement of violations by vehicles that pass a school bus displaying its flashing red lights and a stop sign. In addition, due to high rates of fatalities and injuries to law enforcement and other emergency response crews on roadsides, several states are considering authorizing automated enforcement of violations where motorists fail to slow down and/or move over for emergency responders and law enforcement vehicles at the side of the road. Legislative implementation is a deliberative and necessarily time-consuming process. However, as states expand auto enforcement, the market for our products and services should increase and broaden in the public safety market\n\u25cf\nIncreasing Smart City Market - Nokia has approved the use of our OpenALPR software for its smart city offerings. According to a research report Smart Cities Market by Smart Transportation (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Buildings (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Utilities (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Citizen Services, and Region - Global Forecast to 2023\u201d), published by Markets and Markets, the global market for smart city technology is expected to grow from $308.0 billion in 2018 to $717.2 billion by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate of 18.4% during the forecast period. In the smart city's market, real-time vehicle recognition technologies are widely used for traffic management and public safety. As a result, we expect to benefit from the growth of this market.\n\u25cf\nAccelerated Business Development and Marketing - Our ability to compete in a large, competitive and rapidly evolving industry will require us to achieve and maintain a leadership position. As a result, we have accelerated our business development and marketing activities within the Technology Segment to increase awareness and market adoption of our new technology and products within the market. However, the speed at which these markets grow to the degree of which our products and services are adopted is uncertain.\n\u25cf\nAbility to Scale and Balance Production to Meet Demand - While we have arranged manufacturing capabilities for our products, we are unproven in our ability to deliver large volumes of products at our high-quality standards.\n\u25cf\nSales Cycle - As many of our products are new to market, their acceptance and integration into the intended markets is uncertain and we do not have sufficient historical experience to accurately predict revenues as a result of their implementation.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Government Spending - In July 2019, the White House and bi-partisan congressional negotiators announced they had reached agreement on a two-year federal budget. The proposed plan would raise federal spending by $320 billion over existing caps previously imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Absent a new agreement, earlier legislation would have automatically triggered deep spending cuts next year under a process known as sequestration. Instead, the agreement allowed the government to continue to borrow and increased spending on domestic and military programs, partially funded by $77.4 billion in spending cuts from other budget categories. On August 2, 2019, the President signed the two-year budget agreement which wards off automatic spending cuts and suspends the debt ceiling through July 2021. Agreement on the July spending plan is intended to result in more funding consistency and may reduce the possibility of another government shutdown until after the 2020 elections. Many contractors have geared up for the anticipated increases in spending. We believe this agreement will reduce government spending seasonality and this has begun to lead to a stronger fourth quarter in 2019 and a more robust first quarter in 2020.\nWe believe that recent developments in computing capabilities, such as GPU advances, and new techniques of analysis, sometimes referred to broadly as AI, have broadened the market for vehicle recognition technology and created new opportunities in existing markets. With our new line of products and services, our Technology Segment is working to actively exploit these opportunities. With the anticipated continuation of a stable economic outlook for the government contracting, we believe that the outlook for the operations of our subsidiaries in the Professional Services Segment remains positive.\nConsiderable uncertainty currently exists concerning the extent of spread, efficaciousness of countermeasures and severity of the economic impact of the Covid19 corona virus. This has had, and may continue to have, a severe impact on the financial markets that we depend on to fund our operations. If these economic and market conditions continue for an extended period of time, it could have a significant impact on our financial performance and ability to execute our business strategy. Other than as described above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nNeoSystems Merger\nWe filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on January 25, 2018. A significant portion of the proceeds from the proposed offering were to be used for the planned acquisition of NeoSystems LLC ( NeoSystems\u201d) under a merger agreement. On March 7, 2018, we received notice of termination of the merger agreement and subsequently paid NeoSystems $225,000 in required payments, which was recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2018. No securities were sold in connection with the offering contemplated by the Registration Statement on Form S-1 and it was withdrawn on November 26, 2018.\nSale of Note\nOn February 13, 2018, Rekor Recognition sold a note receivable from Global Public Safety, LLC ( Global Public Safety\u201d), which it had received as part of the purchase price consideration in connection with the sale of its legacy upfitting business prior to its acquisition by Rekor as a result of the merger with KeyStone in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, based on the decision to sell the note receivable to an unrelated third party, we reclassified the note receivable balance to a current asset and wrote down $450,000 as other expense, thus reducing the balance to $1,475,000. Rekor Recognition continues to retain a 19.9% interest in Global Public Safety.\nPromissory Notes\n2018 Promissory Note\nOn April 3, 2018, we entered into a transaction pursuant to which an institutional investor (the Lender\u201d) loaned $2,000,000 to us (the 2018 Promissory Note\u201d). The 2018 Promissory Note is discussed in further detail in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\n2019 Promissory Note\nOn March 12, 2019, we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which investors (the 2019 Lenders\u201d) loaned us $20,000,000 in exchange for promissory notes (the 2019 Promissory Notes\u201d) and we issued to the 2019 Lenders warrants to purchase 2,500,000 shares of our common stock (the March 2019 Warrants\u201d). The 2019 Lenders included the lender for the 2018 Note, a senior company executive and another entity exchanging 2019 Promissory Notes for related party company indebtedness. The 2019 Promissory Note and March 2019 Warrants are discussed in further detail this in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations under Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOther than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nPublic Offering of Common Stock\nOn November 1, 2018, we issued 4,125,000 shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of $0.80 per share. Net proceeds were approximately $2.8 million. In addition, we granted underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 618,750 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotment, if any. The underwriters did not exercise this option and the options were cancelled. As part of this transaction, we also issued to the underwriter warrants to purchase an aggregate of 206,250 shares of common stock, exercisable over a period of five years, at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The underwriter warrants had a value of approximately $0.2 million at issuance and are exercisable commencing April 27, 2019 and expire on October 29, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, the underwriter's had 7,567 unexercised warrants which have an immaterial value.\nAt-the-Market Agreement\nOn August 14, 2019, we entered into the Sales Agreement with B. Riley FBR to create an at the market equity program under which we from time to time may offer and sell shares of our common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through or to B. Riley FBR. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Sales Agreement, B. Riley FBR will use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell the shares of our common stock from time to time, based upon our instructions. B. Riley FBR is entitled to a commission equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale. We incurred issuance costs of approximately $226,000 related to legal, accounting, and other fees in connection with the Sales Agreement. These costs were charged against the gross proceeds of the Sales Agreement and presented as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\nSales of our common stock under the Sales Agreement are to be issued and sold pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No 333-224423), previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC\u201d) on April 24, 2018 and declared effective by the SEC on April 30, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, based on settlement date, we sold 1,292,730 shares of common stock at a weighted-average selling price of $2.53 per share in accordance with the Sales Agreement. Net cash provided from the Sales Agreement was $2,949,000 after paying $226,000 related to the issuance costs stated above, as well as 3.0% or $98,000 related to cash commissions provided to B. Riley FBR. As of December 31, 2019, $11,727,000 remained available for sale under the Sales Agreement.\nComponents of Revenues and Expenses\nRevenues\nWe generate our revenues substantially from two sources: (1) licensing and subscription revenues for software and related products and services and (2) professional services to clients.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products and services. If the consideration promised in the contract includes a variable amount, for example maintenance fees, we include an estimate of the amount we expect to receive in the total transaction price, if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nWe determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u25cf\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u25cf\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u25cf\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied\nThe subscription revenues from software licenses, technology products and services are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to the software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. During the second quarter of 2019, we changed our method of selling in the Technology Segment from perpetual software licenses to monthly service subscriptions. This change is expected to impact our revenue in the short term as we will now recognize revenue ratably over the contract period rather than at a point in time when the customer takes possession of the license. The amount of contract revenue received over the long term is not expected to decline. Our subscription services arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nThe professional services contracts recognize revenue based on a time and materials or fixed fees basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts, or ratably over the contact term for fixed price contracts with subscription services.\nCosts of Revenues\nDirect costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with revenue generating activities. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our revenue generating activities. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, sales and marketing and research and development. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses also include depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative departments. Additional expenses include travel and entertainment, professional fees and insurance.\nWe expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance and investor relations as a public company. However, we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, marketing programs, travel and entertainment associated with sales and marketing personnel, expenses for conferences and trade shows. We intend to make significant investments in our sales and marketing expenses to grow revenue, further penetrate the market and expand our customer base. With the release of our Partners Program we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in the future.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consists of personnel costs, software used to develop our products and consulting and professional fees for third-party development resources. Our research and development expenses support our efforts to continue to add capabilities to our existing products and the strategic shift to develop additional capabilities and improve our AI software.\nWe expect our research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of our AI software. However, we expect our research and development expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report and the historical financial statements of Rekor Systems, Inc., and the related notes thereto.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the field of advanced vehicle identification and management systems driven by leading edge advances in artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). In development for over five years using AI processes, including machine learning algorithms, our core software enables the creation of more powerful and capable vehicle recognition systems that can be deployed at a fraction of the cost of traditional vehicle recognition systems. The software enables a wider field of view, greater light sensitivity, recognitions at faster speeds and higher accuracy rates, in addition to the ability to identify the color, make and type of a vehicle and its direction of travel. These capabilities are particularly useful in solving a wide variety of real-world roadway and vehicle related challenges. In addition, the reductions in cost have opened up a number of new uses for vehicle recognition technology that were not previously cost effective. We currently provide products and services for governmental organizations, for large and small businesses and for individuals throughout the world. Customers are currently using our products or services in over 70 countries, with offerings for smart cities, public safety, security, transportation, parking and logistics.\nCurrently, our business activities include providing professional services in the government contracting, aerospace and aviation industries. As part of the development of a new line of products for the public safety and security markets, we acquired industry leading vehicle recognition software in March 2019. In connection with this acquisition, we determined that our resources are best concentrated on vehicle recognition products and services and have reorganized and retooled our product development, business development and administrative resources, with increasing emphasis on the technology area. Our Board of Directors has also authorized management to explore opportunities for the sale of our professional services businesses. In keeping with the shift in resources and strategic direction that this represents, we have reorganized our financial reporting into two business segments: the Technology Segment and the Professional Services Segment. These two segments reflect our separate focus on and expectations for technology products and services versus professional services.\nOn March 29, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved changing the Company's name to Rekor Systems, Inc. This name change was a result of our increased focus on technology products and services, and aligns with the renaming of Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. to Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. In connection with this name change, we changed:\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market to REKR\u201d and the CUSIP number for the common stock to 759419 104;\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for our Series A Preferred Stock on the OTC Markets OTCQB exchange to REKRP\u201d and the CUSIP number for our Series A Preferred Stock to 759419 203; and\n\u25cf\nthe ticker symbol for warrants on the OTC Markets OTCQB exchange to REKRW\u201d and the CUSIP number for the warrants to 759419 112.\nTechnology Segment. The Technology Segment operations are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary, Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. ( Rekor Recognition\u201d). Formerly Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc., Rekor Recognition has been active in the public safety industry since 1996. In connection with the development of several new public safety products, we determined to acquire substantially all the assets of OpenALPR Technology, Inc. The OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, completed in March 2019, transferred vehicle recognition software and associated licenses and proprietary rights to OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC ( OpenALPR\u201d), a new wholly owned subsidiary of Rekor Recognition, as we have been focused on developing a line of products to transform the fundamental concepts of vehicle recognition. OpenALPR's vehicle recognition platform, already operating in more than 12,000 cameras in 70 countries worldwide, has laid the groundwork for the expansion of our product line, enabling multiple deployment mechanisms.\nSince the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition, we have expanded our vehicle recognition product and service lines into a much broader range of customer segments, starting with public safety. We shifted from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription-based model, rebranded the software suites as Watchman\u201d and Car-Check\u201d and released several packaged hardware solutions with each of these vehicle recognition engines. By the end of 2019, we had a portfolio of more than 10 products, permitting us to offer full-scale vehicle recognition services for nearly any large or small public agency, commercial or residential setting.\nOur vehicle recognition software currently has the capability to analyze multi-spectral images and/or video streams produced by nearly any Internet Protocol security camera and concurrently extract license plate data by state from more than 70 countries, as well as provide the vehicle's make, color, type, and direction of travel. When combined with speed optimized code, parallel processing capability and best-in-class accessories, such as cameras and communications modules, Watchman software delivers vehicle recognition solutions at extremely high-capture rates and with a high degree of accuracy. Additionally, our multi-spectral capabilities enable reading of license plates and vehicle characteristics in unusually difficult conditions (e.g. low lighting, poor weather, extreme camera viewing angles, and obstructions).\nPrior to the development of our vehicle identification software, highly accurate results were not available using a typical Internet Protocol camera. We believe that the ability to use less expensive hardware will change the dynamics of the existing public safety market, enabling the creation of increasingly robust networks with cameras at more locations. In addition, we expect the cost advantages and high degree of accuracy to create competitive advantages compared to electronic tolling systems and logistics operations that currently rely on RFID systems. We also believe our lower costs, our distance and field of view capabilities and the ability to capture additional vehicle information, such as vehicle direction and color, make and type of vehicle, have opened opportunities in other market segments such as parking operations, school safety, retail customer loyalty programs and particularly smart cities and smart roadways. Smart roadway systems, sometimes referred to as smart transport\u201d or intelligent transport systems\u201d ( ITS\u201d), inclusive of parking management and guidance, passenger information, and traffic management systems, can optimize the movement of vehicles to make travel safer and more efficient. These technologies are expected to enable users to be more coordinated, better informed, and make safer and smarter use of transport networks.\nOur vision is AI with a Purpose.\u201d We intend to evolve beyond vehicle recognition for public safety markets into the recognition and analysis of vehicles activities (inclusive of motion and behaviors) to identify unsafe situations (e.g. wrong way driving, pedestrian on roadway, etc.), optimize traffic flows, and develop numerous other data driven applications centered around vehicle knowledge.\nProfessional Services Segment. We provide professional services and staffing solutions to the government contracting and the aerospace and aviation industries. The Professional Services Segment includes AOC Key Solutions, Inc. ( AOC Key Solutions\u201d); Global Technical Services, Inc. ( GTS\u201d); Global Contract Professionals, Inc. ( GCP\u201d, and together with GTS, Global\u201d); and Firestorm Solutions, LLC (Firestorm Solutions\u201d) and Firestorm Franchising, LLC ( Firestorm Franchising\u201d and together with Firestorm Solutions, Firestorm\u201d). Currently, as a leading provider of support services to the federal government contracting market, AOC Key Solutions' primary clients are companies that serve the federal government. However, in support of our Technology Segment, we have recently been active in the state and local government contracting market. We provide professional services that offer scalable and compliant outsourced support for our government contractor clients. We help these clients to win government contracts so that they capture new businesses. Global provides specialized staffing services, primarily in the aerospace and aviation industries. In connection with our internal reorganization, we are actively engaged in evaluating, reconfiguring, selling, and discontinuing various business assets or entities in the Professional Services Segment. As part of this process, we have discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising and have determined to sell Global and AOC Key Solutions.\nAs part of our strategic shift in fiscal year 2019, we are focusing on the Technology Segment and further developing our footprint across different industries by further developing our AI based technologies and distributing and licensing products and services with advanced vehicle recognition features. Current customers are using these products and services for: a) toll collection and traffic analysis in the transportation market, b) school and traffic safety, parking and other law enforcement applications in the public safety market, c) perimeter management and surveillance in the private security market, d) operations and retail customer loyalty programs and e) vehicle tracking, perimeter security and warehouse operations in the logistics market.\nAs a result of our strategic shift, during the third quarter of 2019, we began to separately report the results of Global and considered including substantially all of the assets and liabilities comprising Global as held for sale operations. We are also reporting the operating results and cash flows of Global as held for sale operations, and thus they have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Prior to the third quarter of 2019, the operating results for Global were presented in the Professional Services segment. The assets and liabilities of Global are presented as current and long-term assets and liabilities of businesses held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Since we adopted a formal plan to sell Global in September 2019, we have received several non-binding offers and indications of interest for the purchase of Global which we are in the process of evaluating. In March of 2020, we also received a proposal from the current management of AOC Key Solutions to purchase that subsidiary, which we are also currently evaluating. No assurance can be given as to the certainty of the entry into, or the subsequent closing any of these, proposed transactions.\nGeneral\nThe information provided in this discussion and analysis of Rekor's financial condition and results of operations covers the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During 2019 the Company completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition as more fully described below.\nOur financial results are impacted principally by the demand by clients for our products and services, the degree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities and the success of our sales team in generating client engagements.\nUnexpected changes in the demand for our products and services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.\nThe statements of operations and other information provided in this discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Rekor should be read in conjunction with the Rekor audited consolidated financial statements and the historical financial statements of Rekor Recognition, KeyStone, Firestorm and Global, and the related notes thereto which were filed with the SEC by either KeyStone or Rekor.\nAcquisitions\nOn March 12, 2019, we completed the OpenALPR Technology Acquisition.\nOn June 1, 2019, we sold all the interest we had acquired in Secure Education Consultants, LLC, which we acquired on January 1, 2018. At that time, we also discontinued operations of BC Management. In connection with these actions we recognized a write-off of intangible assets of $242,000. In addition, in June 2019, we discontinued the operations of Firestorm Franchising, resulting in a write-off of an additional $1,310,000 in intangible assets related to Firestorm.\nOpportunities, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe look to identify the various trends, market cycles, uncertainties and other factors that may provide us with opportunities and present challenges that impact our operations and financial condition from time to time. Although there are many that we may not or cannot foresee, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be primarily affected by the following:\n\u25cf\nAI for the Roadway - We believe that the application of AI to the analysis roadway condition will significantly affect vehicular travel in the future by assisting in the intelligent optimization of traffic flows and the identification of anomalous and unsafe movements - e.g. wrong way, stopped vehicle, pedestrian on the roadway. Marketers and drive-thru retailers with loyalty programs can benefit from the rapid identification of existing and potential customers and streamlining vehicular flow.\n\u25cf\nGraphic Processing Unit ( GPU\u201d) Improvements - We expect our business to benefit as a result of more powerful and affordable GPU hardware that has recently been developed. These GPUs are more efficient for image processing because their highly parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central procession units ( CPUs\u201d) for algorithms that process large blocks of data, such as those produced by video streams. GPUs also provide superior memory bandwidth and efficiencies as compared to their CPU counterparts. The most recent versions of our software have been designed to use the increased GPU speeds to accelerate image recognitions. The GPU market is predicted to grow as a result of a surge in adoption of the Internet of Things ( IoT\u201d) by the industrial and automotive sectors. As GPU manufacturers increase production volume, we hope to benefit from the reduced cost to manufacture the hardware included in our products or available to others using our services.\n\u25cf\nAdaptability of the Current ALPR Market - We have made a considerable investment in our advanced vehicle recognition systems because we believe their increased accuracy and affordability will allow them to compete effectively with existing providers. Based on published benchmarks, our software currently outperforms competitors in almost every metric. However, large users of existing ALPR Technology, such as toll roads, have long-term contracts with service providers that have made considerable investments in their existing technologies and may not consider the improvements in accuracy or reductions in cost sufficient to justify abandoning their current systems in the near future. In addition, existing providers may be able to reduce the cost of their current offerings or elect to reduce prices and accept reduced profitability while working to develop or secure their own advanced vehicle recognition systems. As a result, our success in establishing a major position in these markets will depend on being able to effectively communicate our presence, develop strong customer relationships, and maintain leadership in providing the capabilities that customers want. As with any large market, this will require considerable effort and resources.\n\u25cf\nNew and Expanded Uses for Vehicle Recognition Systems - We believe that reductions in the cost of vehicle recognition products and services will significantly broaden the market for these systems. We currently serve a number of users who could not afford the cost or adapt to, the restrictions of conventional vehicle recognition systems. These include smaller municipalities, homeowners' associations, and organizations finding new applications such as innovative customer loyalty programs. We have seen and responded to an increase in the number of smaller jurisdictions and municipalities that are testing ALPR systems or that issued requests for proposals to install a network of ALPR cameras. We also expect the availability of faster, higher accuracy, lower cost systems to dramatically increase the ability of crowded urban areas to manage traffic congestion and implement smart city programs. We do not currently have the resources to develop all of these entirely new markets by ourselves, so we will need to rely on affiliations with other partners, who may or may not realize the significant benefits that we envision from these new uses.\n\u25cf\nExpansion of Automated Enforcement of Motor Vehicle Laws - We believe that future legislation will allow for auto enforcement of motor vehicle regulations to be expanded as the types of violations authorized for automated enforcement increase and experience provides localities with a better understanding of the circumstances where automated enforcement is beneficial. For example, there are now 17 states that allow for the automatic enforcement of violations by vehicles that pass a school bus displaying its flashing red lights and a stop sign. In addition, due to high rates of fatalities and injuries to law enforcement and other emergency response crews on roadsides, several states are considering authorizing automated enforcement of violations where motorists fail to slow down and/or move over for emergency responders and law enforcement vehicles at the side of the road. Legislative implementation is a deliberative and necessarily time-consuming process. However, as states expand auto enforcement, the market for our products and services should increase and broaden in the public safety market\n\u25cf\nIncreasing Smart City Market - Nokia has approved the use of our OpenALPR software for its smart city offerings. According to a research report Smart Cities Market by Smart Transportation (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Buildings (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Utilities (Type, Solutions and Services), Smart Citizen Services, and Region - Global Forecast to 2023\u201d), published by Markets and Markets, the global market for smart city technology is expected to grow from $308.0 billion in 2018 to $717.2 billion by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate of 18.4% during the forecast period. In the smart city's market, real-time vehicle recognition technologies are widely used for traffic management and public safety. As a result, we expect to benefit from the growth of this market.\n\u25cf\nAccelerated Business Development and Marketing - Our ability to compete in a large, competitive and rapidly evolving industry will require us to achieve and maintain a leadership position. As a result, we have accelerated our business development and marketing activities within the Technology Segment to increase awareness and market adoption of our new technology and products within the market. However, the speed at which these markets grow to the degree of which our products and services are adopted is uncertain.\n\u25cf\nAbility to Scale and Balance Production to Meet Demand - While we have arranged manufacturing capabilities for our products, we are unproven in our ability to deliver large volumes of products at our high-quality standards.\n\u25cf\nSales Cycle - As many of our products are new to market, their acceptance and integration into the intended markets is uncertain and we do not have sufficient historical experience to accurately predict revenues as a result of their implementation.\n\u25cf\nU.S. Government Spending - In July 2019, the White House and bi-partisan congressional negotiators announced they had reached agreement on a two-year federal budget. The proposed plan would raise federal spending by $320 billion over existing caps previously imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Absent a new agreement, earlier legislation would have automatically triggered deep spending cuts next year under a process known as sequestration. Instead, the agreement allowed the government to continue to borrow and increased spending on domestic and military programs, partially funded by $77.4 billion in spending cuts from other budget categories. On August 2, 2019, the President signed the two-year budget agreement which wards off automatic spending cuts and suspends the debt ceiling through July 2021. Agreement on the July spending plan is intended to result in more funding consistency and may reduce the possibility of another government shutdown until after the 2020 elections. Many contractors have geared up for the anticipated increases in spending. We believe this agreement will reduce government spending seasonality and this has begun to lead to a stronger fourth quarter in 2019 and a more robust first quarter in 2020.\nWe believe that recent developments in computing capabilities, such as GPU advances, and new techniques of analysis, sometimes referred to broadly as AI, have broadened the market for vehicle recognition technology and created new opportunities in existing markets. With our new line of products and services, our Technology Segment is working to actively exploit these opportunities. With the anticipated continuation of a stable economic outlook for the government contracting, we believe that the outlook for the operations of our subsidiaries in the Professional Services Segment remains positive.\nConsiderable uncertainty currently exists concerning the extent of spread, efficaciousness of countermeasures and severity of the economic impact of the Covid19 corona virus. This has had, and may continue to have, a severe impact on the financial markets that we depend on to fund our operations. If these economic and market conditions continue for an extended period of time, it could have a significant impact on our financial performance and ability to execute our business strategy. Other than as described above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect on our financial condition.\nNeoSystems Merger\nWe filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 with the SEC on January 25, 2018. A significant portion of the proceeds from the proposed offering were to be used for the planned acquisition of NeoSystems LLC ( NeoSystems\u201d) under a merger agreement. On March 7, 2018, we received notice of termination of the merger agreement and subsequently paid NeoSystems $225,000 in required payments, which was recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense in the year ended December 31, 2018.

As of December 31, 2017, based on the decision to sell the note receivable to an unrelated third party, we reclassified the note receivable balance to a current asset and wrote down $450,000 as other expense, thus reducing the balance to $1,475,000.

If the consideration promised in the contract includes a variable amount, for example maintenance fees, we include an estimate of the amount we expect to receive in the total transaction price, if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\nWe determine the amount of revenue to be recognized through application of the following steps:\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n\u25cf\nIdentification of the performance obligations in the contract\n\u25cf\nDetermination of the transaction price\n\u25cf\nAllocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n\u25cf\nRecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied\nThe subscription revenues from software licenses, technology products and services are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to the software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. During the second quarter of 2019, we changed our method of selling in the Technology Segment from perpetual software licenses to monthly service subscriptions. This change is expected to impact our revenue in the short term as we will now recognize revenue ratably over the contract period rather than at a point in time when the customer takes possession of the license. The amount of contract revenue received over the long term is not expected to decline. Our subscription services arrangements are non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\nThe professional services contracts recognize revenue based on a time and materials or fixed fees basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and materials contracts, on a proportional performance basis for fixed price contracts, or ratably over the contact term for fixed price contracts with subscription services.\nCosts of Revenues\nDirect costs of revenues consist primarily of that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages and payroll-related costs incurred in connection with revenue generating activities. Direct costs of revenues also include production expenses, sub-consultant services, and other expenses that are incurred in connection with our revenue generating activities. Direct costs of revenues exclude that portion of technical and non-technical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts, vacations, holidays, and other time not spent directly generating fees under existing contracts. Such costs are included in operating expenses. We expense direct costs of revenues when incurred.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of general and administrative expenses, sales and marketing and research and development. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, payroll taxes and stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses also include depreciation, amortization and impairment of assets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense consists of personnel costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative departments. Additional expenses include travel and entertainment, professional fees and insurance.\nWe expect our general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future due to additional costs associated with accounting, compliance, insurance and investor relations as a public company. However, we expect our general and administrative expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long term, although our general and administrative expense may fluctuate as a percentage of our revenue from period to period due to the timing and extent of these expenses.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, marketing programs, travel and entertainment associated with sales and marketing personnel, expenses for conferences and trade shows. We intend to make significant investments in our sales and marketing expenses to grow revenue, further penetrate the market and expand our customer base. With the release of our Partners Program we expect our sales and marketing expense to increase in the future.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consists of personnel costs, software used to develop our products and consulting and professional fees for third-party development resources. Our research and development expenses support our efforts to continue to add capabilities to our existing products and the strategic shift to develop additional capabilities and improve our AI software.\nWe expect our research and development expense to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development efforts to enhance the functionality of our AI software. However, we expect our research and development expense to decrease as a percentage of our revenue over the long"}
