    "item_7": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. Unless otherwise noted, references to year\u201d pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please read the following discussion together with the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA Joint Venture.\nOverview\nWe are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.\nOur products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.\nOur broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nProduct Demand- There are numerous factors that influence demand for our products. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, primarily in the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America. The non-residential, residential, agricultural and infrastructure markets we serve are affected by the\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\navailability of credit, lending practices, interest rates and unemployment rates. Demand for new homes, farm income, commercial development and highway infrastructure spending have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on our business in the markets in which our products are sold:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the strength of the economy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the amount and type of non-residential and residential construction;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> funding for infrastructure spending;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> farm income and agricultural land values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> inventory of improved housing lots;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in raw material prices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the availability and cost of credit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> non-residential occupancy rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commodity prices; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> demographic factors such as population growth and household formation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct Pricing - The price of our products is impacted by competitive pricing dynamics in our industry as well as by raw material input costs. Our industry is highly competitive and the sales prices for our products may vary based on the sales policies of our competitors. Raw material costs represent a significant portion of the cost of goods sold for our pipe products, or Pipe. We aim to increase our product selling prices in order to cover raw material price increases, but the inability to do so could impact our profitability. Movements in raw material costs and resulting changes in the selling prices may also impact changes in period-to-period comparisons of net sales.\nMaterial Conversion - Our HDPE and PP pipe and related water management product lines compete with other manufacturers of corrugated polyethylene pipe as well as manufacturers of alternative products made with traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and PVC. Our net sales are driven by market trends, including the continued increase in adoption of thermoplastic corrugated pipe products as a replacement for traditional materials. Thermoplastic corrugated pipe is generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable products made from traditional materials. We believe customers will continue to acknowledge the superior attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products and expanded regulatory approvals allow for their use in new markets and geographies. In addition, we believe that PP pipe products will also help accelerate conversion given the additional applications for which our PP pipe products can be used.\nWe believe the adoption of HDPE and PP pipe outside of the United States is still in its early stages and represents a significant opportunity for us to continue to increase the conversion to our products from traditional products in these markets, including Canada, Mexico and South America where we operate.\nGrowth in Allied Products - Our Allied Products include storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings, stormwater filters and water separators. These products complement our pipe product lines and allow us to offer a comprehensive water management solution to our customers and drive organic growth. Our leading market position in pipe products allows us to cross-sell Allied Products effectively. Our comprehensive offering of Allied Products also helps us increase pipe sales in certain markets. Our Allied Products are less sensitive to increases in resin prices since resin prices represent a smaller percentage of the cost for Allied Products.\nOur leading position in the pipe market has allowed us to increase organic growth of our Allied Products. We also expect to expand our Allied Product offerings through acquisitions.\nRaw Material Costs - Our raw material cost and product selling prices fluctuate with changes in the price of resins utilized in production. We actively manage our resin purchases and pass fluctuations in the cost of resin through to our customers, where possible, in order to maintain our profitability. Fluctuations in the price of crude oil and\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nnatural gas prices may impact the cost of resin. In addition, changes in and disruptions to existing ethylene or polyethylene capacities could also significantly increase resin prices (such as the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in late 2015), often within a short period of time, even if crude oil and natural gas prices remain low. Our ability to pass through raw material price increases to our customers may, in some cases, lag the increase in our costs of goods sold. Sharp rises in raw material prices over a short period of time have historically occurred with a significant supply disruption (hurricanes or fires at petrochemical facilities), which may increase prices to levels that cannot be fully passed through to customers due to pricing of competing products made from different raw materials or the anticipated length of time the raw material pricing will stay elevated. For more information regarding risks relating to our raw material costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business.\u201d\nWe currently purchase in excess of 850 million pounds of virgin and recycled resin annually from over 480 suppliers in North America. As a high-volume buyer of resin, we are able to achieve economies of scale to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. Our purchasing strategies differ based on the material (virgin resin versus recycled material) ordered for delivery to our production locations. The price movements of the different materials also vary, resulting in the need to use a number of strategies to reduce volatility.\nIn order to reduce the volatility of raw material costs in the future, our raw material strategies for managing our costs include the following:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increasing the use of less price-volatile recycled HDPE resin in our pipe products in place of virgin resin while meeting or exceeding industry standards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> internally processing an increasing percentage of our recycled HDPE resin in order to closely monitor quality and minimize costs (approximately 88% of our recycled HDPE resin was internally processed in fiscal year 2017);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> managing a resin price risk program that entails both physical fixed price and volume contracts along with financial hedges. For our polypropylene virgin resin price exposure, we utilize financial hedges of propylene as a proxy for the polypropylene.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintaining supply agreements with our major resin suppliers that provide multi-year terms and volumes that are in excess of our projected consumption.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also consume a large amount of energy and other petroleum products in our operations, including the electricity we use in our manufacturing process as well as the diesel fuel consumed in delivering a significant volume of products to our customers through our in-house fleet. As a result, our operating profit also depends upon our ability to manage the cost of the energy and fuel we require, as well as our ability to pass through increased prices or surcharges to our customers.\nSeasonality - Our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions accelerating construction project activity during these periods while fourth quarter results are impacted by the timing of spring in the northern United States and Canada. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay projects, resulting in decreased net sales for one or more quarters, but we believe that these delayed projects generally result in increased net sales during subsequent quarters.\nIn the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets in the northern United States and Canada, the construction season typically begins to gain momentum in late March and lasts through November, before winter sets in, significantly slowing the construction markets. In the southern and western United States, Mexico, Central America and South America, the construction markets are less seasonal. The agricultural drainage market is concentrated in the early spring just prior to planting and in the fall just after crops are harvested prior to freezing of the ground in winter.\nCurrency Exchange Rates - Although we sell and manufacture our products in many countries, our sales and production costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We have wholly-owned facilities in Canada, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico and joint venture facilities in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nThe functional currencies in the areas in which we have wholly-owned facilities and joint venture facilities other than the U.S. dollar are the Canadian dollar, Euro, Mexican peso, Chilean peso, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Colombian peso. From time to time, we use derivatives to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations. During fiscal 2015, we began to implement hedging strategies to manage exposure to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, which we continued in fiscal 2016 and 2017.\nDescription of our Segments\nWe operate a geographically diverse business, serving customers in approximately 80 countries. For fiscal 2017, approximately 88% ($1,102.2 million) of net sales were attributable to customers located in the United States and approximately 12% ($155.1 million) of net sales were attributable to customers outside of the United States.\nOur operations are organized into two reportable segments based on the markets we serve: Domestic and International. We generate a greater proportion of our net sales and gross profit in our Domestic segment, which consists of all regions of the United States. We expect the percentage of total net sales and gross profit derived from our International segment to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand globally. See Note 21. Business Segment Information,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nDomestic - Our operating results have been, and will continue to be, impacted by macroeconomic trends in the United States. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to our Domestic segment of $1,102.2 million, $1,113.8 million, and $1,027.9 million, respectively. Unconsolidated sales for our domestic unconsolidated joint ventures (our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015), were $18.7 million, $20.9 million and $24.9 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nInternational - Our International segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside of the United States, with a growth strategy focused on our owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through our joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Pipe manufactured in these countries is primarily sold into the same region. Our joint venture strategy has provided us with local and regional access to new markets. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to our International segment of $155.1 million, $176.9 million, and $152.1 million, respectively. Our investment in the South American Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method and is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The unconsolidated sales of the South American Joint Venture were $42.2 million, $50.3 million, and $58.5 million, in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries - In February 2017, we acquired the assets of Plastic Tubing Industries ( PTI\u201d), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories, in an all cash transaction for $9.5 million. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. With the acquisition, we will increase our manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to existing manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA. Our measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d.\nSystem-Wide Net Sales - System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure which equals the sum of the net sales of our Domestic and International segments plus all net sales from our unconsolidated joint ventures (our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015). We use this metric to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve.\nOur South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as an integral part of our Domestic segment. However, with the exception of our BaySaver joint venture which we have consolidated since we acquired it on July 17, 2015, they are not consolidated under GAAP. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,257,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,290,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales associated with our unconsolidated\naffiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> South American Joint Venture (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BaySaver joint venture (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tigre-ADS USA joint venture (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> System-Wide Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,318,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,361,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,263,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> On July 31, 2009, we entered into an arrangement to form our South American joint venture.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> On July 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to form our BaySaver joint venture.

This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation and definition of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), and the Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding (Non-GAAP) to our Net Income (loss) available to common stockholders - Basic, Net income (loss) per share - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d.\nFree Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company's Board of Directors to assess the Company's ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow does not include property, plant and equipment purchases completed through financing arrangements. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, see Item 6.

The increase was primarily the result of lower raw material costs of $38.7 million due to decreased raw material prices. The increase was offset by the decrease in net sales discussed above, a $5.2 million increase in labor and overhead costs and a $3.5 million increase in transportation expenses.\nInternational gross profit decreased $7.7 million, or 21.7%, for fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 primarily due to the decrease in sales discussed above and a $6.6 million increase in labor and overhead cost. The decreases were offset by a $17.2 million decrease in raw material due to decreased raw material cost and a $1.3 million decrease in transportation expenses.\nSelling expenses - Selling expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $3.0 million, or 3.4%, over fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense of $2.9 million primarily resulting from the deterioration of five customer accounts, including a $0.6 million write off of a receivable from an unconsolidated affiliate. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 7.3% for fiscal year 2017 compared to 6.9% over fiscal year 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $18.4 million, or 19.9%, over fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation expense of $8.0 million for fiscal 2017 compared to a benefit of $5.1 million for fiscal 2016. Additionally, legal and professional fees increased by $6.5 million as a result of third-party consulting expenses and ongoing litigation.\nLoss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - Loss on the disposal of assets or businesses totaled $8.5 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2016, a net increase of $7.7 million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we recorded expenses related to three manufacturing facilities that were closed during fiscal 2017 of approximately $3.5 million and accelerated depreciation of specifically identified obsolete assets of approximately $3.0 million. In addition, we recorded $2.0 million of disposals and partial disposals of fixed assets, as compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2016.\nIntangible amortization - Intangible amortization remained relatively flat in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense - Interest expense from our debt and capital lease obligations decreased $1.0 million or 5.4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. Our average overall outstanding debt was down by $46.0 million or 11.8% for fiscal 2017 compared to the average balance outstanding for fiscal 2016. The impact of lower debt outstanding on interest expense was partially offset by higher average capital lease obligations of $6.6 million or 9.1% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nDerivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net - Derivative (gains) losses and other (income) expense, net, improved to gains of $6.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to losses of $16.6 million in fiscal 2016.

The remainder of the change is primarily related to foreign exchange gains.\nIncome tax expense - The provision for income taxes totaled $24.6 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $23.5 million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $1.1 million. These provisions represent an effective tax rate of 38.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 39.6% in fiscal 2016. The current year tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to state and local income taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates. The current year tax rate decreased from the prior year primarily due to the income tax impacts of the closure of the Puerto Rico manufacturing facility partially offset by the income tax impacts of stock-based compensation. For fiscal 2017, uncertain tax positions related to foreign jurisdictions were released due to the lapse of statute of limitations.\nEquity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates - Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $0.9 million over fiscal 2017 to a net loss of $4.3 million for fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $5.2 million during fiscal 2016. The net loss decreased due to the $4.0 million impairment charge related to our investment in the South American Joint Venture in fiscal 2016, which was partially offset by the $1.3 million impairment charge related to our investment in the South American Joint Venture in fiscal 2017 and our share of higher net losses during fiscal 2017 of $2.5 million compared to $1.4 million during fiscal 2016.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest - Income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased $2.5 million, or 46.4%, to $3.0 million in fiscal 2017 compared to $5.5 million in fiscal year 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the net income of ADS-Mexicana.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nFiscal Year Ended March 31, 2016 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2015\nThe following table summarizes certain financial information relating to our operating results that have been derived from our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.

fiscal 2015. Domestic pipe sales increased $40.9 million, or 5.3%, due to continued growth in our N-12 HDPE and High Performance Polypropylene product lines and further gains from conversion to our products from traditional products, offsetting lower agricultural sales. Domestic pipe selling prices decreased 0.2% as compared to the prior year. Allied Product sales increased $45.0 million, or 17.5%, due to strong sales volume sold primarily into the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets. In addition, approximately $10.2 million of the total Allied Product sales increase relates to the acquisition of BaySaver during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016. International sales increased $24.8 million, or 16.3%, to $176.9 million in fiscal 2016, as compared to $152.1 million in the prior year. The growth was primarily due to increased sales in Canada, including in particular the contribution from the acquisition\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nof Ideal Pipe, which increased sales by approximately $39.7 million, helping to offset decreased sales in Mexico of $9.4 million. In addition, the Canadian dollar was approximately 13% weaker against the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, which had a negative impact on net sales for Canada of $15.2 million during the year ended March 31, 2016.\nCost of goods sold and Gross profit - Cost of goods sold increased $30.3 million, or 3.1%, to $1,005.3 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to $975.0 million during fiscal 2015.\nGross profit increased $80.3 million, or 39.1%, to $285.4 million from $205.1 million during fiscal year 2015.

In addition to the impact of the 8.4% increase in domestic net sales over the prior fiscal year, the increase was driven by a reduction in raw material costs of approximately 10.0%, particularly pipe resin costs. Raw material prices were flat in the first quarter and declined in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year periods. Freight costs totaled 9.8% of domestic net sales for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. The higher freight costs relate to increased depreciation charges associated with new tractors and trailers added to the delivery fleet, which offset the benefit of lower diesel fuel. Diesel prices began to moderate towards the end of fiscal year 2015 and continued to decline throughout fiscal 2016. Diesel fuel prices during 2016 were approximately 31.0% below fiscal 2015.\nInternational gross profit increased $9.9 million, or 38.6%, for fiscal year 2016 over fiscal 2015. This was the result of the impact of a 16.3% increase in international net sales, decreased resin costs and improved gross profit performance in Mexico during fiscal 2016.\nSelling expenses - Selling expenses for fiscal 2016 increased $8.0 million, or 9.9% over fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by bad debt expense and stock-based compensation. Fiscal 2016 included a benefit of $0.5 million from stock-based compensation as compared to expense of $1.5 million for the comparable period, which was primarily the result of the impact that the decrease in the Company's stock price had on its accounting for liability-classified stock awards. The increase in bad debt expense of $1.6 million was primarily a result of a write off of a receivable from an unconsolidated affiliate.\nGeneral and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses for the fiscal 2016 increased $16.6 million, or 21.9%, over fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily the result of significant increases in professional fees for accounting, audit, tax, legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of previously filed quarterly and annual financial statements as part of the preparation of our Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. There were no such amounts in fiscal 2015. These fees amounted to approximately $28.0 million in fiscal year 2016. There was also an increase in salary and compensation expenses of 12%, or $3.4 million, as well as incremental general and administrative expenses related to the Ideal Pipe and BaySaver acquisitions of $1.9 million. There were additional increases related to higher corporate overhead including higher depreciation expense as well as increased legal and administrative costs associated with being a public company. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $26.7 million, which was primarily the result of the impact that the decrease in the Company's stock price had on its accounting for liability-classified stock awards. Overall, general and administrative expenses amounted to 7.2% of net sales compared to 6.4% in the prior year.\nLoss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - Loss on the disposal of assets or businesses totaled $0.8 million in fiscal 2016 compared to of $0.4 million in fiscal 2015, a net increase of $0.4 million in fiscal\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\n2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. Businesses sold in fiscal year 2015 related to our GEO-flow product line, while there were no businesses sold in fiscal 2016. Dispositions of machinery and equipment resulted in a loss of $0.8 million and $1.1 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and related to the replacement of assets in the normal course of business.\nIntangible amortization - Intangible amortization decreased $0.6 million or 5.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease is mainly the result of intangible assets of $7.8 million becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015, offset by the additional amortization for the Ideal Pipe intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the BaySaver intangible assets acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest expense - Interest expense from our debt and capital lease obligations decreased $0.9 million or 4.7% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015, the Company carried a higher Revolving Credit Facility balance through July 2014 until the IPO proceeds were used to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility balance.\nDerivative losses and other expense, net - Derivative losses and other expense, net, increased $2.2 million in fiscal 2016 to $16.6 million compared to $14.4 million in fiscal 2015. The increase in expense is predominantly a result of both realized and unrealized losses on hedging activities. The hedging losses in fiscal 2016 were $16.9 million comprised of realized losses on cash settlements of $14.7 million and unrealized losses on mark-to-market adjustments of $2.2 million. This compares to a net hedging loss of $15.4 million incurred during fiscal 2015, consisting of realized losses on cash settlements of $7.7 million and unrealized losses of $7.7 million on the unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments. In addition to the hedging losses, the Company realized a loss of $0.5 million upon completing the acquisition of BaySaver as a result of remeasuring our investment as of the July 17, 2015 step acquisition. See Note 3. Acquisitions.\u201d The balance of the change relates primarily to foreign currency transaction activity and other insignificant gains or losses.\nIncome tax expense - The provision for income taxes totaled $23.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.3 million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $17.2 million. These provisions represent an effective tax rate of 39.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to 127.6% in fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2015 effective tax rate significantly exceeded the federal statutory rate due in part to the significant permanent differences associated with non-deductible ESOP stock appreciation and stock-based compensation expense, the effect of which was increased by the near break-even amount of pre-tax income, whereas the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate more closely approximates a normal effective tax rate for the Company.\nEquity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates - Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates increased $2.9 million over fiscal 2015 to a net loss of $5.2 million for fiscal 2016 compared to a net loss of $2.3 million during fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $4.0 million impairment charge related to our investment in the South American Joint Venture, which was partially offset by lower net losses generated by the South American Joint Venture which reduced our share of the losses during fiscal 2016 to $1.4 million compared to $2.6 million for the comparable prior year period.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest - Income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $1.4 million, or 33.5%, to $5.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $4.1 million in fiscal 2015. As noted above, the 35.0% noncontrolling interest for BaySaver is now included in the fiscal 2016 results beginning after July 17, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and dividend payments for our convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, our operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had $5.1 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries and undistributed earnings of approximately $28.0 million. Our intent is to indefinitely reinvest our earnings in foreign subsidiaries\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nwith the exception of cash dividends paid by our ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdiction.\nAt March 31, 2017, we had no undistributed earnings of our unconsolidated subsidiaries included in retained earnings.\nIn February 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of our common stock. Repurchases of common stock will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion.\nWorking Capital and Cash Flows\nDuring the fiscal 2017, our net decrease in cash amounted to $0.1 million compared to a net increase of $3.0 million during fiscal 2016. Our source of funds in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a decrease in cash used in financing activities offset by increased cash used in investing activities and a decrease in cash used by operations. Our use of cash in fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by increased inventories, capital expenditures, payment of capital lease obligations, and the payment of dividends. Our source of funds in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by higher operating earnings and the impact of increased current liabilities, lower inventories and non-cash charges (depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense). Our use of cash in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by capital expenditures, a reduction of our debt, payment of capital lease obligations, and the payment of dividends. Our source of funds in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher operating earnings, net proceeds of $72.2 million from shares sold during our IPO after deduction of deferred offering costs, and the impact of non-cash charges (depreciation, amortization, compensation expense and share-based compensation expense). Our use of cash in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by increased inventory balances of $10.1 million the settlement of a Canadian dollar currency hedge related to the Ideal Pipe acquisition of $5.6 million, spending for acquisitions of $36.4 million, net repayment of $54.2 million of debt and payment of $9.3 million of capital lease obligations.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had $151.6 million in liquidity, including $6.5 million of cash, $120.1 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility and $25.0 million under the senior notes, described below. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and dividend payment requirement for our convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months.\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had consolidated indebtedness (excluding capital lease obligations) of approximately $350.4 million, down $1.2 million compared to March 31, 2016.\nThe following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods presented:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statement of Cash Flows data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61,259\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,018\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing\nactivities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42,825\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (82,964\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWorking Capital - Working capital is an indication of liquidity and potential need for short-term funding. We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities.\nWorking capital decreased to $184.8 million as of March 31, 2017, from $187.4 million as of March 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $17.9 million and deferred income taxes and other current assets of $8.9 million. As disclosed in Note 1, the reduction of net current deferred tax assets is due to the adoption of an accounting standard update that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current. These increases were largely offset by an increase in inventory of $27.9 million.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nWorking capital decreased to $187.4 million as of March 31, 2016, from $228.9 million as of March 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in inventories of $30.1 million and an increase in accounts payable of $7.7 million and current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $29.8 million, largely offset by an increase in receivables of $32.6 million.\nOperating Cash Flows - During the fiscal 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $104.2 million as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $135.3 million for fiscal 2016. Cash flow from operating activities during fiscal 2017 was primarily impacted by a $27.9 million increase in inventory and other changes in working capital.\nDuring fiscal 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $135.3 million as compared with cash provided by operating activities of $74.4 million for fiscal 2015. Cash flow from operating activities during fiscal 2016 was primarily impacted by an increase in net income of $34.3 million, a $18.1 million reduction in the use of cash related to changes in current assets and current liabilities, a $29.5 million change in the impact of deferred income taxes and a $5.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a reduction in ESOP and stock-based compensation of $33.0 million and a reduction in the fair market value adjustments to derivatives of $5.5 million.\nInvesting Cash Flows - During fiscal 2017, cash used for investing activities was $61.3 million, primarily due to $46.7 million for capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and $8.6 million for the acquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries ( PTI\u201d) and $4.6 million for the purchase of equipment through financing.\nDuring fiscal 2016, cash used for investing activities was $49.0 million, primarily due to $44.9 million for capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, and $3.2 million for the acquisition of BaySaver.\nDuring fiscal 2015, cash used for investing activities was $76.1 million, primarily due to $32.1 million for capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, a $36.4 million investment in Ideal Pipe, a $3.6 million investment in a domestic joint venture operation created in the first quarter fiscal 2015, and a $4.0 million investment in our international joint venture operation to support growth initiatives.\nFinancing Cash Flows - During fiscal 2017, cash used in financing activities was $42.8 million, primarily for net debt payments of $5.1 million, payments on our capital lease obligations of $21.8 million and dividend payments of $16.8 million.\nDuring fiscal 2016, cash used in financing activities was $83.0 million, primarily for net debt payments of $48.7 million, payments on our capital lease obligations of $19.8 million and dividend payments of $16.2 million.\nDuring fiscal 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $1.8 million, with net proceeds of $72.2 million from the IPO of our common stock after deducting deferred offering costs, largely offset by net debt payments, payments on our capital lease obligation, IPO offering costs and dividend payments.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled $46.7 million for fiscal 2017. Our capital expenditures were used primarily for major plant equipment replacements, new equipment to provide capacity additions, facility expansions and yard upgrades, our recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. Our most significant capital expenditures specifically for increased capacity was $7.5 million in fiscal 2017 for the opening of our new manufacturing facility in Harrisonville, MO.\nCapital expenditures totaled $44.9 million for fiscal 2016. Our capital expenditures were used primarily for major plant equipment replacements, new equipment to provide capacity additions, facility expansions and yard upgrades, our recycled resin initiatives and capitalized software. Our most significant capital expenditures specifically for increased capacity was $7.9 million in fiscal 2016, primarily for tooling for the Midwest and South regions.\nWe currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately $55-60 million in fiscal 2018. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nDebt and Capitalized Lease Obligations\nSee Note 5. Leases\u201d and Note 12. Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of the Company's financing transactions, including the Secured Bank Term Loans, the Senior Notes and the Company's capital lease obligations.\nCovenant Compliance\nOur outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash income taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash interest expense, scheduled principal payments on indebtedness, and ESOP capital distributions in excess of $10 million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of March 31, 2017. In December 2016, we determined that certain intercompany loans between ADS Mexicana and ADS, Inc. that occurred between November 2014 and November 2015 that triggered an event of default according to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility. On December 13, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a covenant waiver from the lenders.\nContractual Obligations as of March 31, 2017\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 350,361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 311,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 483,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 93,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 354,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The Secured Bank Term Loans mature in June 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Based on applicable rates and pricing margins as of March 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> Purchase obligations include commitments with vendors to purchase raw material.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, with the exception of the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in Note 11. Related Party Transactions\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,\u201d of this Form 10-K. Our maximum potential obligation under this guarantee totals $11 million as of March 31, 2017. The maximum borrowing permitted under the South American Joint Venture's credit facility is $22 million. As of March 31, 2017, our South American Joint Venture had approximately $16.0 million of outstanding debt subject to our guarantee, resulting in our guarantee of 50%, or $8.0 million, of that amount. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nCertain of our accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application, and therefore, represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Unless otherwise noted, references to year\u201d pertain to our fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please read the following discussion together with the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA Joint Venture.\nOverview\nWe are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.\nOur products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.\nOur broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nProduct Demand- There are numerous factors that influence demand for our products. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, primarily in the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America. The non-residential, residential, agricultural and infrastructure markets we serve are affected by the\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\navailability of credit, lending practices, interest rates and unemployment rates. Demand for new homes, farm income, commercial development and highway infrastructure spending have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on our business in the markets in which our products are sold:\n \u2022 the strength of the economy; \n \u2022 the amount and type of non-residential and residential construction; \n \u2022 funding for infrastructure spending; \n \u2022 farm income and agricultural land values; \n \u2022 inventory of improved housing lots; \n \u2022 changes in raw material prices; \n \u2022 the availability and cost of credit; \n \u2022 non-residential occupancy rates; \n \u2022 commodity prices; and \n \u2022 demographic factors such as population growth and household formation. \nProduct Pricing - The price of our products is impacted by competitive pricing dynamics in our industry as well as by raw material input costs. Our industry is highly competitive and the sales prices for our products may vary based on the sales policies of our competitors. Raw material costs represent a significant portion of the cost of goods sold for our pipe products, or Pipe. We aim to increase our product selling prices in order to cover raw material price increases, but the inability to do so could impact our profitability. Movements in raw material costs and resulting changes in the selling prices may also impact changes in period-to-period comparisons of net sales.\nMaterial Conversion - Our HDPE and PP pipe and related water management product lines compete with other manufacturers of corrugated polyethylene pipe as well as manufacturers of alternative products made with traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and PVC. Our net sales are driven by market trends, including the continued increase in adoption of thermoplastic corrugated pipe products as a replacement for traditional materials. Thermoplastic corrugated pipe is generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable products made from traditional materials. We believe customers will continue to acknowledge the superior attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products and expanded regulatory approvals allow for their use in new markets and geographies. In addition, we believe that PP pipe products will also help accelerate conversion given the additional applications for which our PP pipe products can be used.\nWe believe the adoption of HDPE and PP pipe outside of the United States is still in its early stages and represents a significant opportunity for us to continue to increase the conversion to our products from traditional products in these markets, including Canada, Mexico and South America where we operate.\nGrowth in Allied Products - Our Allied Products include storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings, stormwater filters and water separators. These products complement our pipe product lines and allow us to offer a comprehensive water management solution to our customers and drive organic growth. Our leading market position in pipe products allows us to cross-sell Allied Products effectively. Our comprehensive offering of Allied Products also helps us increase pipe sales in certain markets. Our Allied Products are less sensitive to increases in resin prices since resin prices represent a smaller percentage of the cost for Allied Products.\nOur leading position in the pipe market has allowed us to increase organic growth of our Allied Products. We also expect to expand our Allied Product offerings through acquisitions.\nRaw Material Costs - Our raw material cost and product selling prices fluctuate with changes in the price of resins utilized in production. We actively manage our resin purchases and pass fluctuations in the cost of resin through to our customers, where possible, in order to maintain our profitability. Fluctuations in the price of crude oil and\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nnatural gas prices may impact the cost of resin. In addition, changes in and disruptions to existing ethylene or polyethylene capacities could also significantly increase resin prices (such as the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in late 2015), often within a short period of time, even if crude oil and natural gas prices remain low. Our ability to pass through raw material price increases to our customers may, in some cases, lag the increase in our costs of goods sold. Sharp rises in raw material prices over a short period of time have historically occurred with a significant supply disruption (hurricanes or fires at petrochemical facilities), which may increase prices to levels that cannot be fully passed through to customers due to pricing of competing products made from different raw materials or the anticipated length of time the raw material pricing will stay elevated. For more information regarding risks relating to our raw material costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business.\u201d\nWe currently purchase in excess of 850 million pounds of virgin and recycled resin annually from over 480 suppliers in North America. As a high-volume buyer of resin, we are able to achieve economies of scale to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. Our purchasing strategies differ based on the material (virgin resin versus recycled material) ordered for delivery to our production locations. The price movements of the different materials also vary, resulting in the need to use a number of strategies to reduce volatility.\nIn order to reduce the volatility of raw material costs in the future, our raw material strategies for managing our costs include the following:\n \u2022 increasing the use of less price-volatile recycled HDPE resin in our pipe products in place of virgin resin while meeting or exceeding industry standards; \n \u2022 internally processing an increasing percentage of our recycled HDPE resin in order to closely monitor quality and minimize costs (approximately 88% of our recycled HDPE resin was internally processed in fiscal year 2017); \n \u2022 managing a resin price risk program that entails both physical fixed price and volume contracts along with financial hedges. For our polypropylene virgin resin price exposure, we utilize financial hedges of propylene as a proxy for the polypropylene. \n \u2022 maintaining supply agreements with our major resin suppliers that provide multi-year terms and volumes that are in excess of our projected consumption. \nWe also consume a large amount of energy and other petroleum products in our operations, including the electricity we use in our manufacturing process as well as the diesel fuel consumed in delivering a significant volume of products to our customers through our in-house fleet. As a result, our operating profit also depends upon our ability to manage the cost of the energy and fuel we require, as well as our ability to pass through increased prices or surcharges to our customers.\nSeasonality - Our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions accelerating construction project activity during these periods while fourth quarter results are impacted by the timing of spring in the northern United States and Canada. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay projects, resulting in decreased net sales for one or more quarters, but we believe that these delayed projects generally result in increased net sales during subsequent quarters.\nIn the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets in the northern United States and Canada, the construction season typically begins to gain momentum in late March and lasts through November, before winter sets in, significantly slowing the construction markets. In the southern and western United States, Mexico, Central America and South America, the construction markets are less seasonal. The agricultural drainage market is concentrated in the early spring just prior to planting and in the fall just after crops are harvested prior to freezing of the ground in winter.\nCurrency Exchange Rates - Although we sell and manufacture our products in many countries, our sales and production costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We have wholly-owned facilities in Canada, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico and joint venture facilities in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nThe functional currencies in the areas in which we have wholly-owned facilities and joint venture facilities other than the U.S. dollar are the Canadian dollar, Euro, Mexican peso, Chilean peso, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Colombian peso. From time to time, we use derivatives to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations. During fiscal 2015, we began to implement hedging strategies to manage exposure to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, which we continued in fiscal 2016 and 2017.\nDescription of our Segments\nWe operate a geographically diverse business, serving customers in approximately 80 countries. For fiscal 2017, approximately 88% ($1,102.2 million) of net sales were attributable to customers located in the United States and approximately 12% ($155.1 million) of net sales were attributable to customers outside of the United States.\nOur operations are organized into two reportable segments based on the markets we serve: Domestic and International. We generate a greater proportion of our net sales and gross profit in our Domestic segment, which consists of all regions of the United States. We expect the percentage of total net sales and gross profit derived from our International segment to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand globally. See Note 21. Business Segment Information,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nDomestic - Our operating results have been, and will continue to be, impacted by macroeconomic trends in the United States. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to our Domestic segment of $1,102.2 million, $1,113.8 million, and $1,027.9 million, respectively. Unconsolidated sales for our domestic unconsolidated joint ventures (our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015), were $18.7 million, $20.9 million and $24.9 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nInternational - Our International segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside of the United States, with a growth strategy focused on our owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through our joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Pipe manufactured in these countries is primarily sold into the same region. Our joint venture strategy has provided us with local and regional access to new markets. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to our International segment of $155.1 million, $176.9 million, and $152.1 million, respectively. Our investment in the South American Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method and is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The unconsolidated sales of the South American Joint Venture were $42.2 million, $50.3 million, and $58.5 million, in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries - In February 2017, we acquired the assets of Plastic Tubing Industries ( PTI\u201d), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories, in an all cash transaction for $9.5 million. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. With the acquisition, we will increase our manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to existing manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA. Our measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d.\nSystem-Wide Net Sales - System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure which equals the sum of the net sales of our Domestic and International segments plus all net sales from our unconsolidated joint ventures (our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015). We use this metric to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve.\nOur South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as an integral part of our Domestic segment. However, with the exception of our BaySaver joint venture which we have consolidated since we acquired it on July 17, 2015, they are not consolidated under GAAP. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\n\n (a) On July 31, 2009, we entered into an arrangement to form our South American joint venture. \n (b) On July 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to form our BaySaver joint venture. As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership to 65%, and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such, net sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item. \n (c) On April 7, 2014, we entered into an arrangement to form our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. \nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nAdjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share, Adjusted Net Income and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding - Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP and all redeemable common shares were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation and definition of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), and the Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding (Non-GAAP) to our Net Income (loss) available to common stockholders - Basic, Net income (loss) per share - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d.\nFree Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company's Board of Directors to assess the Company's ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow does not include property, plant and equipment purchases completed through financing arrangements.

Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe consolidate all of our joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for our South American Joint Venture and our Tigre-ADS USA Joint Venture.\nOverview\nWe are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform, our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In the United States, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11 billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.\nOur products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to our products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.\nOur broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nProduct Demand- There are numerous factors that influence demand for our products. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, primarily in the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America. The non-residential, residential, agricultural and infrastructure markets we serve are affected by the\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\navailability of credit, lending practices, interest rates and unemployment rates. Demand for new homes, farm income, commercial development and highway infrastructure spending have a direct impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on our business in the markets in which our products are sold:\n \u2022 the strength of the economy; \n \u2022 the amount and type of non-residential and residential construction; \n \u2022 funding for infrastructure spending; \n \u2022 farm income and agricultural land values; \n \u2022 inventory of improved housing lots; \n \u2022 changes in raw material prices; \n \u2022 the availability and cost of credit; \n \u2022 non-residential occupancy rates; \n \u2022 commodity prices; and \n \u2022 demographic factors such as population growth and household formation. \nProduct Pricing - The price of our products is impacted by competitive pricing dynamics in our industry as well as by raw material input costs. Our industry is highly competitive and the sales prices for our products may vary based on the sales policies of our competitors. Raw material costs represent a significant portion of the cost of goods sold for our pipe products, or Pipe. We aim to increase our product selling prices in order to cover raw material price increases, but the inability to do so could impact our profitability. Movements in raw material costs and resulting changes in the selling prices may also impact changes in period-to-period comparisons of net sales.\nMaterial Conversion - Our HDPE and PP pipe and related water management product lines compete with other manufacturers of corrugated polyethylene pipe as well as manufacturers of alternative products made with traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and PVC. Our net sales are driven by market trends, including the continued increase in adoption of thermoplastic corrugated pipe products as a replacement for traditional materials. Thermoplastic corrugated pipe is generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable products made from traditional materials. We believe customers will continue to acknowledge the superior attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic products and expanded regulatory approvals allow for their use in new markets and geographies. In addition, we believe that PP pipe products will also help accelerate conversion given the additional applications for which our PP pipe products can be used.\nWe believe the adoption of HDPE and PP pipe outside of the United States is still in its early stages and represents a significant opportunity for us to continue to increase the conversion to our products from traditional products in these markets, including Canada, Mexico and South America where we operate.\nGrowth in Allied Products - Our Allied Products include storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings, stormwater filters and water separators. These products complement our pipe product lines and allow us to offer a comprehensive water management solution to our customers and drive organic growth. Our leading market position in pipe products allows us to cross-sell Allied Products effectively. Our comprehensive offering of Allied Products also helps us increase pipe sales in certain markets. Our Allied Products are less sensitive to increases in resin prices since resin prices represent a smaller percentage of the cost for Allied Products.\nOur leading position in the pipe market has allowed us to increase organic growth of our Allied Products. We also expect to expand our Allied Product offerings through acquisitions.\nRaw Material Costs - Our raw material cost and product selling prices fluctuate with changes in the price of resins utilized in production. We actively manage our resin purchases and pass fluctuations in the cost of resin through to our customers, where possible, in order to maintain our profitability. Fluctuations in the price of crude oil and\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nnatural gas prices may impact the cost of resin. In addition, changes in and disruptions to existing ethylene or polyethylene capacities could also significantly increase resin prices (such as the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in late 2015), often within a short period of time, even if crude oil and natural gas prices remain low. Our ability to pass through raw material price increases to our customers may, in some cases, lag the increase in our costs of goods sold. Sharp rises in raw material prices over a short period of time have historically occurred with a significant supply disruption (hurricanes or fires at petrochemical facilities), which may increase prices to levels that cannot be fully passed through to customers due to pricing of competing products made from different raw materials or the anticipated length of time the raw material pricing will stay elevated. For more information regarding risks relating to our raw material costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business.\u201d\nWe currently purchase in excess of 850 million pounds of virgin and recycled resin annually from over 480 suppliers in North America. As a high-volume buyer of resin, we are able to achieve economies of scale to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. Our purchasing strategies differ based on the material (virgin resin versus recycled material) ordered for delivery to our production locations. The price movements of the different materials also vary, resulting in the need to use a number of strategies to reduce volatility.\nIn order to reduce the volatility of raw material costs in the future, our raw material strategies for managing our costs include the following:\n \u2022 increasing the use of less price-volatile recycled HDPE resin in our pipe products in place of virgin resin while meeting or exceeding industry standards; \n \u2022 internally processing an increasing percentage of our recycled HDPE resin in order to closely monitor quality and minimize costs (approximately 88% of our recycled HDPE resin was internally processed in fiscal year 2017); \n \u2022 managing a resin price risk program that entails both physical fixed price and volume contracts along with financial hedges. For our polypropylene virgin resin price exposure, we utilize financial hedges of propylene as a proxy for the polypropylene. \n \u2022 maintaining supply agreements with our major resin suppliers that provide multi-year terms and volumes that are in excess of our projected consumption. \nWe also consume a large amount of energy and other petroleum products in our operations, including the electricity we use in our manufacturing process as well as the diesel fuel consumed in delivering a significant volume of products to our customers through our in-house fleet. As a result, our operating profit also depends upon our ability to manage the cost of the energy and fuel we require, as well as our ability to pass through increased prices or surcharges to our customers.\nSeasonality - Our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of our products have been higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions accelerating construction project activity during these periods while fourth quarter results are impacted by the timing of spring in the northern United States and Canada. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay projects, resulting in decreased net sales for one or more quarters, but we believe that these delayed projects generally result in increased net sales during subsequent quarters.\nIn the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets in the northern United States and Canada, the construction season typically begins to gain momentum in late March and lasts through November, before winter sets in, significantly slowing the construction markets. In the southern and western United States, Mexico, Central America and South America, the construction markets are less seasonal. The agricultural drainage market is concentrated in the early spring just prior to planting and in the fall just after crops are harvested prior to freezing of the ground in winter.\nCurrency Exchange Rates - Although we sell and manufacture our products in many countries, our sales and production costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We have wholly-owned facilities in Canada, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico and joint venture facilities in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nThe functional currencies in the areas in which we have wholly-owned facilities and joint venture facilities other than the U.S. dollar are the Canadian dollar, Euro, Mexican peso, Chilean peso, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Colombian peso. From time to time, we use derivatives to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations. During fiscal 2015, we began to implement hedging strategies to manage exposure to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, which we continued in fiscal 2016 and 2017.\nDescription of our Segments\nWe operate a geographically diverse business, serving customers in approximately 80 countries. For fiscal 2017, approximately 88% ($1,102.2 million) of net sales were attributable to customers located in the United States and approximately 12% ($155.1 million) of net sales were attributable to customers outside of the United States.\nOur operations are organized into two reportable segments based on the markets we serve: Domestic and International. We generate a greater proportion of our net sales and gross profit in our Domestic segment, which consists of all regions of the United States. We expect the percentage of total net sales and gross profit derived from our International segment to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand globally. See Note 21. Business Segment Information,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nDomestic - Our operating results have been, and will continue to be, impacted by macroeconomic trends in the United States. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to our Domestic segment of $1,102.2 million, $1,113.8 million, and $1,027.9 million, respectively. Unconsolidated sales for our domestic unconsolidated joint ventures (our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015), were $18.7 million, $20.9 million and $24.9 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nInternational - Our International segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside of the United States, with a growth strategy focused on our owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through our joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Pipe manufactured in these countries is primarily sold into the same region. Our joint venture strategy has provided us with local and regional access to new markets. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to our International segment of $155.1 million, $176.9 million, and $152.1 million, respectively. Our investment in the South American Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method and is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The unconsolidated sales of the South American Joint Venture were $42.2 million, $50.3 million, and $58.5 million, in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries - In February 2017, we acquired the assets of Plastic Tubing Industries ( PTI\u201d), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories, in an all cash transaction for $9.5 million. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. With the acquisition, we will increase our manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to existing manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Our presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA. Our measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d.\nSystem-Wide Net Sales - System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure which equals the sum of the net sales of our Domestic and International segments plus all net sales from our unconsolidated joint ventures (our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015). We use this metric to measure the overall performance of our business across all of our geographies and markets we serve.\nOur South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of our International segment, and our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and our BaySaver joint venture are managed as an integral part of our Domestic segment. However, with the exception of our BaySaver joint venture which we have consolidated since we acquired it on July 17, 2015, they are not consolidated under GAAP. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if our South American Joint Venture, our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and our BaySaver joint venture were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of System-Wide Net Sales to Net sales, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> (Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,257,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,290,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,180,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net sales associated with our unconsolidated\naffiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> South American Joint Venture (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BaySaver joint venture (b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tigre-ADS USA joint venture (c)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> System-Wide Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,318,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,361,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,263,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) On July 31, 2009, we entered into an arrangement to form our South American joint venture. \n (b) On July 15, 2013, we entered into an arrangement to form our BaySaver joint venture. As of July 17, 2015, we increased our ownership to 65%, and have consolidated BaySaver since that date. As such, net sales from our BaySaver joint venture prior to July 17, 2015 are included in this line item. \n (c) On April 7, 2014, we entered into an arrangement to form our Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. \nAdvanced Drainage Systems, Inc.\nAdjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share, Adjusted Net Income and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding - Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP and all redeemable common shares were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to our employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation and definition of Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), and the Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding (Non-GAAP) to our Net Income (loss) available to common stockholders - Basic, Net income (loss) per share - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding - Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data\u201d.\nFree Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and the Company's Board of Directors to assess the Company's ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow does not include property, plant and equipment purchases completed through financing arrangements. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nFor a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Cash flow from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, see Item 6.
