MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as other sections of this annual report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only our beliefs, assumptions, expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed under the Section heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nFactors that may affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements include, among other things, leadership changes, our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain qualified consultants and senior leaders; our ability to develop and maintain strong, long-term relationships with our clients; fluctuations in the global and local economies and our ability to execute successfully our strategies;social or political instability in markets where we operate, the impact of the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit); the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings; price competition; the ability to forecast, on a quarterly basis, variable compensation accruals that ultimately are determined based on the achievement of annual results; our ability to realize our tax losses; the timing of the establishment or reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; the mix of profit and loss by country; our ability to integrate future acquisitions; our reliance on information management systems; any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets; and the ability to align our cost structure and headcount with net revenue. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nWe are a leadership advisory firm providing executive search, leadership consulting and culture shaping services. We help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and development of senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level services offers us several advantages that include access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility, and a leveraged global footprint, which create added barriers to entry for potential competitors. Working at the top of client organizations also allows us to attract and retain high-caliber consultants.\nIn addition to executive search, we provide leadership consulting expertise and culture shaping services including executive leadership assessment; leadership, team and board development; succession planning; talent strategy; people performance; inter-team collaboration; and organizational transformation.\nWe have announced the combination of our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses to create Heidrick Consulting, a comprehensive offering of the firm's advisory services. We anticipate that our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reportable segments will be combined into one reportable segment, Heidrick Consulting, during the first quarter of 2018.\nWe provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 380 consultants located in major cities around the world. Our executive search services are provided on a retained basis. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, we often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. Indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage and assess Heidrick & Struggles' performance through various means, with the primary financial and operational measures including net revenue, operating income, operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP). Executive Search and Leadership Consulting performance is also measured using consultant headcount. Specific to Executive Search, confirmation trends, consultant productivity and average revenue per search are used to measure performance.\nRevenue is driven by market conditions and a combination of the number of executive search engagements and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects and the average revenue per search or project. With the exception of compensation expense, incremental increases in revenue do not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs, particularly operating and administrative expenses, thus potentially improving operating margins.\nThe number of consultants, confirmation trends, number of searches or projects completed, productivity levels and the average revenue per search or project will vary from quarter to quarter, affecting net revenue and operating margin.\nOur Compensation Model\nAt the Executive Search consultant level there are fixed and variable components of compensation. Individuals are rewarded for their performance based on a system that directly ties a portion of their compensation to the amount of net revenue for which they are responsible. A portion of the reward may be based upon individual performance against a series of non-financial measures. Credit towards the variable portion of an executive search consultant's compensation is earned by generating net revenue for winning and executing work. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Executive Search consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly. The amount of variable compensation that is accrued for each Executive Search consultant is based on a tiered payout model. Overall Company performance determines the amount available for total variable compensation. The more net revenue that is generated by the consultant, the higher the percentage credited towards the consultant's variable compensation and thus accrued by our Company as expense. The mix of individual consultants who generate the revenue can significantly affect the total amount of compensation expense recorded, which directly impacts operating margin. As a result, the variable portion of the compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. The total variable compensation is discretionary and is based on Company-wide financial targets approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nA portion of our Executive Search consultants' and management cash bonuses is deferred and paid over a three-year vesting period. The compensation expense related to the amounts being deferred is recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period. This service period begins on January 1 of the respective fiscal year and continues through the deferral date, which coincides with our bonus payments in the first quarter of the following year, and for an additional three year vesting period. The deferrals are recorded in Accrued salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n2017 Overview\nConsolidated net revenue was $621.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $39.0 million or 6.7% compared to December 31, 2016. Specific to Executive Search, our largest business, consultant productivity measured by net executive search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Average revenue per executive search was $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating loss as a percentage of net revenue was 4.3% in 2017 compared to operating margin of 6.0% in 2016. The change in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of $39.0 million, which was offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $34.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.2 million, impairment charges of $50.7 million and restructuring charges of $15.7 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 69.9% in 2017 and 68.7% in 2016. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 23.7% in 2017 and 25.3% in 2016\nWe ended the year with combined cash and cash equivalents of $207.5 million, an increase of $42.5 million compared to $165.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due increased cash collections and lower acquisition investments. These increases in cash were partially offset by cash paid for restructuring charges. We pay the majority of bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they were earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the Company's performance and the performance of the individual employee. We expect to pay approximately\n$148.0 million in bonuses related to 2017 performance in March and April 2018. In January 2018, we paid approximately $13.0 million in cash bonuses deferred in prior years.\n2018 Outlook\nWe are currently forecasting 2018 first quarter net revenue of between $150 million and $160 million. Our 2018 first quarter guidance is based upon, among other things, management's assumptions for the anticipated volume of new executive search confirmations and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects, the current backlog, consultant productivity, consultant retention, the seasonality of our business and average currency rates from December 2017.\nOur 2018 first quarter guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under Risk Factors (See Item 1A. Risk Factors) and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K. As such, actual results could vary from these projections.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the results of operations (in thousands):\nTable 52:

In 2017, the Culture Shaping business continued the transition of senior-level personnel which began in 2016, primarily due to planned retirements. The Company has experienced lower than expected consultant productivity during the transition period. Also, the marketplace for culture shaping services has become increasingly more competitive and the business experienced lengthening sales cycles and decision processes within target client organizations. These events led to a decline in the revenue performance of the business and uncertainty around the timing of improving such performance. As a result, the Company identified a triggering event and performed an interim impairment evaluation on the goodwill and intangible assets related to its Culture Shaping reporting unit during the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Based on the results of the impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Culture Shaping reporting unit were impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $39.2 million to write-off all of the goodwill and intangible assets.\nAdditionally, based on the results of the annual impairment evaluation, performed by the Company as of October 31, 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Leadership Consulting reporting unit were impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $11.6 million to write-off all of the goodwill and intangible assets. Throughout the year, the Company was continually evaluating the results of its Leadership Consulting business, including Philosophy IB failing to achieve targets outlined in its earnout agreement and the potential impact of the conclusion of the Co Company earnout on the reporting unit. In the fourth quarter, the Company finalized its assessment of these events and its forecast for the Leadership Consulting reporting unit in future years.

In January 2018, we paid approximately $13.0 million in variable compensation that was deferred in prior years.\nCash flows provided by operating activities. In 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $70.0 million, principally reflecting net income net of non-cash charges of $21.1 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $18.3 million and a restructuring accrual of $13.0 million. The increae in accrued expenses primarily reflects approximately $148 million of current year bonus accruals partially offset by $128 million of bonus payments for 2016 made in early 2017.\nIn 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $24.8 million, primarily reflecting depreciation and amortization expense of $16.4 million, net income of $15.4 million, stock based compensation expense of $6.4 million and an increase in the net retirement and pension plan liability of $4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $14.4 million, a change in other assets and liabilities of $3.0 million and an increase in prepaid expenses of $2.3 million.\nIn 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $57.6 million, principally reflecting an increase in accrued expenses of $37.2 million, higher net income of $17.1 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $13.7 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $8.7 million. The accrued expense increase reflects approximately $113 million of bonus payments for 2014 and prior year cash deferrals partially offset by 2015 bonus accruals of $148 million. The accounts receivable increase reflects higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the fourth quarter of 2014.\nCash flows used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities was $15.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to capital expenditures of $14.0 million and purchases of available for sale securities of $2.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities of $1.4 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily the result of office build-outs and a global information technology update.\nCash used in investing activities was $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of JCA Group, DSI and Philosophy IB. This use of cash was partially offset by a reduction in restricted cash of $7.2 million primarily due to a release of funds for the retention bonuses paid to certain key executives related to the Senn Delaney acquisition.\nCash used in investing activities was $27.5 million in 2015, primarily due to capital expenditures of $16.4 million, the acquisition of Co Company for $10.3 million, and net purchases of available for sale securities of $0.8 million. Capital expenditures primarily related to office build outs or renovations for eight offices, of which $4.3 million was reimbursed as tenant improvement allowances and reflected as an operating activity. Our capital expenditures consist mostly of office build outs and investments in technology.\nCash flows used in financing activities. Cash used in financing activities in 2017 was $17.1 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.1 million, earnout payments related to the Co Company and Scambler MacGregor acquisitions of $4.6 million, and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.4 million. Gross proceeds and payments on the Company's line of credit were each $40.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash used in financing activities in 2016 was $20.1 million due to cash dividend payments of $10.0 million, earnout payments for the Senn Delaney, Scambler MacGregor and Co Company acquisitions of $6.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and the payment of employee tax withholdings on equity transactions of $2.7 million.\nCash used in financing activities in 2015 was $46.3 million primarily due to debt repayments of $29.5 million, quarterly cash dividend payments to shareholders of $10.0 million and earnout payments of $5.5 million related to the Senn Delaney and Scambler MacGregor acquisitions.\nOn February 11, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized management to repurchase shares of our common stock with an aggregate total amount up to $50 million. We intend from time to time and as business conditions warrant, to purchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in negotiated or block trades. No time limit has been set for completion of this program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2017. The most recent purchase of shares of common stock occurred during the year ended December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we have purchased 1,038,670 shares of our common stock for a total of $28.3 million and $21.7 million remains available for future purchases under the authorization. Unless terminated or extended earlier by resolution of the board of directors, the program will expire when the amount authorized for repurchases has been spent.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have material off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, trading activities of non-exchange traded contracts or transactions with related parties.\nContractual obligations. The following table presents our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations (in millions):\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due for the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the fair value of the obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets, primarily related to our obligation at the end of the lease term to return office space to the landlord in its original condition.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations included in the above table, we have liabilities related to certain employee benefit plans. These liabilities are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017. The obligations related to these employee benefit plans are described in Note 11, Employee Benefit Plans, and Note 12, Pension Plan and Life Insurance Contract, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As the timing of cash disbursements related to these employee benefit plans is uncertain, we have not included these obligations in the above table. The table excludes our liability for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest and penalties, which totaled $0.1 million as of December 31, 2017, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nAn accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, that could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue recognition. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. For each assignment, we and our client enter into a contract that outlines the general terms and conditions of the assignment. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, generally, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, we often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. Indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search. We generally bill our clients for our retainer and indirect expenses in one-third increments over a three-month period commencing in the month of a client's acceptance of the contract.\nNet revenue is recognized when earned and realizable and therefore when the following criteria have been met: (a) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (b) services have been rendered, (c) the fee to our client is fixed or determinable, and (d) collectability is reasonably assured. Taxes collected from clients and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis. Typically, net revenue from standard executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance, in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the arrangements. Net revenue in excess of the retainer, resulting from actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeding\nthe estimated compensation, is recognized upon completion of the executive search when the amount of the additional fee is known.\nNet revenue associated with culture shaping consulting is recognized proportionally as services are performed. Net revenue associated with licenses to use our culture shaping proprietary materials is typically recognized over the term of the arrangement.\nDepending on the terms of that agreement, net revenue from certain leadership consulting and non-standard executive search engagements is either recognized proportionally as services are performed or in accordance with the completion of the engagement deliverables.\nIncome taxes. Determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment. As a global company, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.\nWe apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our cumulative quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense. In the event there are significant unusual or infrequent items recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs.\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets is based on management's belief that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will be utilized. We assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis. In making this assessment, we consider all positive and negative evidence, and all potential sources of taxable income including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, tax-planning strategies, projected future taxable income and recent financial performance.\nDeferred taxes have been recorded for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. Annually, we assess material changes in estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in order to determine whether these earnings should be distributed. If so, an additional provision for taxes may apply, which could materially affect our future effective tax rate.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. We review goodwill for impairment annually. We also review goodwill and long-lived assets; including identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value has fallen below the carrying amount of an asset. We review factors such as a significant change in business climate, attrition of key personnel, changes in financial condition or results of operations, a prolonged decline in our stock price and market capitalization, competition, and other factors to determine if an impairment test is necessary. Our annual impairment test begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a fair value based goodwill impairment test. The qualitative assessment includes evaluating whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that fair values of reporting units are greater than the carrying values. If the qualitative factors do not indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units are greater than the carrying values then we perform the fair value test.\nThe Company operates five reporting units: Americas; Europe, which includes Africa; Asia Pacific, which includes the Middle East; Leadership Consulting; and Culture Shaping. The goodwill impairment test is completed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The fair value of each of the Company's reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The discounted cash flow approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends, forecasted revenue and costs, capital investments, appropriate discount rates, certain assumptions to allocate shared costs, assets and liabilities, historical and projected performance of our reporting units, the outlook for the executive search industry, and the macroeconomic conditions affecting each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price and assumed control premium, among other factors. As a result, actual future results may differ from those estimates and may result in a future impairment charge. These assumptions are updated annually, at a minimum, to reflect information concerning our reportable segments. The fair value of the Asia Pacific reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods. The Company continues to monitor potential triggering events including changes in the business climate in which it operates, the Company's market capitalization compared to its book value, and the Company's recent operating performance, specifically in relation to the Asia Pacific reporting unit. Any\nchanges in these factors could result in an impairment charge. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, however, the loss recognized is not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAdditionally, we review long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge, equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset, is recognized.\nWe believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of our reportable segments.\nRecently Adopted Financial Accounting Standards\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. The Board also eliminated the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity is required to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount of net assets. The Company early adopted ASU 2017-04, during the three months ended June 30, 2017. The Company concluded that ASU 2017-04 is preferable to the current guidance included in ASC 350 due to the simplified process of subsequently measuring goodwill.\nRecent Financial Accounting Standards\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, Scope of Modification Accounting, which is intended to provide clarity and reduce both diversity in practice, cost and complexity when implementing a change in the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. ASU 2017-09 requires that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value, vesting conditions, and whether the award is classified as a liability instrument or an equity instrument remain unchanged in the modification. ASU 2017-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. The impact of this accounting guidance will be dependent on future modification events including the number of awards modified.\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post-retirement Benefit Cost, which is intended to improve the consistency, transparency and usefulness of net benefit cost disclosures. ASU 2017-07 requires that an employer report the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line item or items as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. Additionally, the other components of net benefit costs are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations. ASU 2017-07 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. The impact of this accounting guidance will not be material to the Company's financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, which requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore amounts generally described as restricted cash should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The Company currently does not include restricted cash amounts in the beginning and ending cash amounts and will change the presentation of the cash flow statement to include restricted cash in the beginning and ending cash totals. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. If the Company had adopted the guidance as of December 31,\n2017, the beginning and ending balance of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have each increased by $0.6 million in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which is intended to reduce diversity in practice as to how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. The Company has evaluated the standard and noted the guidance for contingent consideration payments made after a business combination are applicable to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company currently classifies all contingent consideration payments as financing activities. The impact of this change is not expected to be significant to the classification of these activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The new guidance will require entities that lease assets to recognize on their balance sheets the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases and to disclose key information about the leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance on January 1, 2019. The guidance requires lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting guidance. The effect is not known or reasonably estimable at this time.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments including the recognition of unrealized changes in fair value within net income. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, the Company will reclassify approximately $6.1 million of unrecognized gains on the Company's available for sale securities, which are currently included in accumulated other comprehensive income, to retained earnings. Future holding gains on the Company's available for sale securities will be recorded in earnings. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had holding gains of approximately $2.7 million, prior to the reclassification of realized gains to earnings, on its available for sale securities, which would have been recognized in earnings under ASU 2016-01. The amount of future holding gains or losses is dependent upon market conditions and may substantially fluctuate between periods.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The ASU requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for these goods or services. The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The guidance permits the use of either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective method reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients or (ii) a retrospective method with the cumulative effect upon initial adoption recognized at the date of initial application (modified retrospective). The Company will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018 and will apply the modified retrospective method, which involves recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the guidance at the date of initial application with no restatement of the comparative periods presented.\nThe Company continues to perform its evaluation of ASU No. 2014-09 and has made certain assessments regarding each of its primary revenue streams.\nExecutive Search - The Company's executive search engagements involve the receipt of a retainer that is equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. If actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the original compensation estimate, the Company is often authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess compensation. The Company refers to this excess compensation billing as uptick revenue. Currently, the Company recognizes uptick revenue upon the completion of the executive search at the point the uptick revenue becomes fixed and determinable. Under ASU No. 2014-09, uptick revenue is considered variable consideration and the Company will be required to estimate this revenue at contract inception. The Company has developed an estimation process utilizing the expected value method, incorporating historical uptick revenue realized in the Company's geographic regions and industry practices, which will result in an initial recording of a contract's uptick revenue that is probable not to result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized when the actual amount of uptick revenue for that contract is known. Estimates of uptick revenue will be recognized using the same over time revenue recognition model the Company currently utilizes to recognize retainer revenue, and differences between the estimated and actual amount of uptick revenue will be recorded when known. Typically, revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected average period of performance, in\nproportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the executive search arrangement. The Company is currently quantifying the required transition adjustment for the Executive Search revenue streams.\nLeadership Consulting - The Company does not anticipate a significant change in revenue recognition as it relates to its leadership consulting engagements. Substantially all of the Company's engagements will continue to be recognized over time although the identification of the performance obligations within any given engagement may differ from the Company's current revenue recognition methodology.\nCulture Shaping - The Company does not anticipate a significant change in revenue recognition as it relates to its culture shaping consulting engagements. Substantially all of the Company's consulting engagements will continue to be recognized over time although the identification of the performance obligations within any given engagement may differ from the Company's current revenue recognition methodology. The Company has concluded that licenses to use our proprietary culture shaping materials, which the Company refers to as enterprise agreements, generally contain a material right resulting in the recognition of this type of revenue over a longer period of time. The Company is currently quantifying the required transition adjustment.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\nThe following table sets forth certain financial information for each quarter of 2017 and 2016.

These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed under the Section heading Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nFactors that may affect the outcome of the forward-looking statements include, among other things, leadership changes, our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain qualified consultants and senior leaders; our ability to develop and maintain strong, long-term relationships with our clients; fluctuations in the global and local economies and our ability to execute successfully our strategies;social or political instability in markets where we operate, the impact of the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union (Brexit); the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; unfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings; price competition; the ability to forecast, on a quarterly basis, variable compensation accruals that ultimately are determined based on the achievement of annual results; our ability to realize our tax losses; the timing of the establishment or reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets; the mix of profit and loss by country; our ability to integrate future acquisitions; our reliance on information management systems; any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets and other long-lived assets; and the ability to align our cost structure and headcount with net revenue.

We help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and development of senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level services offers us several advantages that include access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility, and a leveraged global footprint, which create added barriers to entry for potential competitors. Working at the top of client organizations also allows us to attract and retain high-caliber consultants.\nIn addition to executive search, we provide leadership consulting expertise and culture shaping services including executive leadership assessment; leadership, team and board development; succession planning; talent strategy; people performance; inter-team collaboration; and organizational transformation.\nWe have announced the combination of our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses to create Heidrick Consulting, a comprehensive offering of the firm's advisory services. We anticipate that our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reportable segments will be combined into one reportable segment, Heidrick Consulting, during the first quarter of 2018.\nWe provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 380 consultants located in major cities around the world. Our executive search services are provided on a retained basis. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled. In addition, if the actual compensation of a placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation, we often are authorized to bill the client for one-third of the excess. Indirect expenses are calculated as a percentage of the retainer with certain dollar limits per search.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe manage and assess Heidrick & Struggles' performance through various means, with the primary financial and operational measures including net revenue, operating income, operating margin, Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), and Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP). Executive Search and Leadership Consulting performance is also measured using consultant headcount. Specific to Executive Search, confirmation trends, consultant productivity and average revenue per search are used to measure performance.\nRevenue is driven by market conditions and a combination of the number of executive search engagements and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects and the average revenue per search or project. With the exception of compensation expense, incremental increases in revenue do not necessarily result in proportionate increases in costs, particularly operating and administrative expenses, thus potentially improving operating margins.\nThe number of consultants, confirmation trends, number of searches or projects completed, productivity levels and the average revenue per search or project will vary from quarter to quarter, affecting net revenue and operating margin.\nOur Compensation Model\nAt the Executive Search consultant level there are fixed and variable components of compensation. Individuals are rewarded for their performance based on a system that directly ties a portion of their compensation to the amount of net revenue for which they are responsible. A portion of the reward may be based upon individual performance against a series of non-financial measures. Credit towards the variable portion of an executive search consultant's compensation is earned by generating net revenue for winning and executing work. Each quarter, we review and update the expected annual performance of all Executive Search consultants and accrue variable compensation accordingly. The amount of variable compensation that is accrued for each Executive Search consultant is based on a tiered payout model. Overall Company performance determines the amount available for total variable compensation. The more net revenue that is generated by the consultant, the higher the percentage credited towards the consultant's variable compensation and thus accrued by our Company as expense. The mix of individual consultants who generate the revenue can significantly affect the total amount of compensation expense recorded, which directly impacts operating margin. As a result, the variable portion of the compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. The total variable compensation is discretionary and is based on Company-wide financial targets approved by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\nA portion of our Executive Search consultants' and management cash bonuses is deferred and paid over a three-year vesting period. The compensation expense related to the amounts being deferred is recognized on a graded vesting attribution method over the requisite service period. This service period begins on January 1 of the respective fiscal year and continues through the deferral date, which coincides with our bonus payments in the first quarter of the following year, and for an additional three year vesting period. The deferrals are recorded in Accrued salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n2017 Overview\nConsolidated net revenue was $621.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $39.0 million or 6.7% compared to December 31, 2016. Specific to Executive Search, our largest business, consultant productivity measured by net executive search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Average revenue per executive search was $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating loss as a percentage of net revenue was 4.3% in 2017 compared to operating margin of 6.0% in 2016. The change in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of $39.0 million, which was offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $34.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.2 million, impairment charges of $50.7 million and restructuring charges of $15.7 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 69.9% in 2017 and 68.7% in 2016. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 23.7% in 2017 and 25.3% in 2016\nWe ended the year with combined cash and cash equivalents of $207.5 million, an increase of $42.5 million compared to $165.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due increased cash collections and lower acquisition investments. These increases in cash were partially offset by cash paid for restructuring charges. We pay the majority of bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they were earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the Company's performance and the performance of the individual employee. We expect to pay approximately\n$148.0 million in bonuses related to 2017 performance in March and April 2018. In January 2018, we paid approximately $13.0 million in cash bonuses deferred in prior years.\n2018 Outlook\nWe are currently forecasting 2018 first quarter net revenue of between $150 million and $160 million. Our 2018 first quarter guidance is based upon, among other things, management's assumptions for the anticipated volume of new executive search confirmations and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects, the current backlog, consultant productivity, consultant retention, the seasonality of our business and average currency rates from December 2017.\nOur 2018 first quarter guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under Risk Factors (See Item 1A. Risk Factors) and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this Form 10-K. As such, actual results could vary from these projections.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, the results of operations (in thousands):\n\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, our results of operations as a percentage of revenue before reimbursements (net revenue):\n\nNote: Totals and subtotals may not equal the sum of individual line items due to rounding.\nWe operate our executive search services in the Americas; Europe (which includes Africa); and Asia Pacific (which includes the Middle East) and operate our leadership consulting and culture shaping businesses as separate segments (See Note 17, Segment Information).\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, our revenue and operating income by segment (in thousands):\n\n (1) Operating income for the Americas includes $0.8 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \n (2) Operating income for Europe includes $4.0 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \n (3) Operating income for Asia Pacific includes $2.0 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \n (4) Operating loss for Leadership Consulting includes $11.6 million of impairment charges and $0.9 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \n (5) Operating loss for Culture Shaping includes $39.2 million of impairment charges and $2.5 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \n (6) Operating loss for Global Operations Support includes $5.5 million of restructuring charges in 2017. \nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nTotal revenue. Consolidated total revenue increased $39.2 million, or 6.5%, to $640.1 million in 2017 from $600.9 million in 2016. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue before reimbursements (net revenue).\nRevenue before reimbursements (net revenue). Consolidated net revenue increased $39.0 million or 6.7%, to $621.4 million in 2017 from $582.4 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which negatively impacted results by $1.4 million, or 0.2%, consolidated net revenue increased $40.4 million, or 6.9%. Executive Search net revenue was $552.0 million in 2017, an increase of $44.7 million compared to 2016. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Leadership Consulting net revenue increased $2.4 million, or 6.2%, to $41.2 million in 2017 from $38.8 million in 2016. Culture Shaping net revenue was $28.1 million in 2017, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 22.3%, compared to 2016.\nThe number of Executive Search, Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping consultants was 346, 19 and 17, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 compared to 335, 22 and 17, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Specific to Executive Search, our largest business, productivity as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 4.5% compared to 2016. The average revenue per executive search increased to $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.1 million, or 8.5%, to $434.2 million in 2017 from $400.1 million in 2016. The increase was due to higher variable compensation of $23.2 million and higher fixed compensation of $10.9 million. Fixed compensation increased due to higher average headcount due to our recent acquisitions, new hires over the last year, and the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $1.5 million. Variable compensation increased due to increased production over the prior year. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which positively impacted results by $0.4 million, or 0.1%, consolidated salaries and benefits expense increased $34.5 million, or 8.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, we had an average of 1,798 employees, compared to an average of 1,716 employees in 2016. As a percentage of net revenue, salaries and employee benefits expense was 69.9% in 2017, compared to 68.7% in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Consolidated general and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million, or 0.2%, to $147.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $147.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which positively impacted results by $0.8 million, or 0.5%, consolidated general and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million, or 0.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses were 23.7% in 2017, compared to 25.3% in 2016.\nImpairment charges. In 2017, the Culture Shaping business continued the transition of senior-level personnel which began in 2016, primarily due to planned retirements. The Company has experienced lower than expected consultant productivity during the transition period. Also, the marketplace for culture shaping services has become increasingly more competitive and the business experienced lengthening sales cycles and decision processes within target client organizations. These events led to a decline in the revenue performance of the business and uncertainty around the timing of improving such performance. As a result, the Company identified a triggering event and performed an interim impairment evaluation on the goodwill and intangible assets related to its Culture Shaping reporting unit during the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Based on the results of the impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Culture Shaping reporting unit were impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $39.2 million to write-off all of the goodwill and intangible assets.\nAdditionally, based on the results of the annual impairment evaluation, performed by the Company as of October 31, 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Leadership Consulting reporting unit were impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $11.6 million to write-off all of the goodwill and intangible assets. Throughout the year, the Company was continually evaluating the results of its Leadership Consulting business, including Philosophy IB failing to achieve targets outlined in its earnout agreement and the potential impact of the conclusion of the Co Company earnout on the reporting unit. In the fourth quarter, the Company finalized its assessment of these events and its forecast for the Leadership Consulting reporting unit in future years. The forecast for the Leadership Consulting reporting unit indicated significant uncertainty around the pace and timing of growth in profitability in the Leadership Consulting reporting unit as the Company invests in talent and service offerings, which resulted in the impairment of the Leadership Consulting goodwill.\nThe aforementioned impairment charges of $50.7 million are recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The impairments were non-cash in nature and did not affect our current liquidity, cash flows, borrowing capability or operations; nor did they impact the debt covenants under our credit agreement.\nRestructuring charges During the fourth quarter, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its operations. As a result of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $15.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include approximately $13.1 million in severance related charges, $2.3 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.3 million in office related charges.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income was a loss of $26.5 million in 2017, compared to income of $35.2 million in 2016. The operating loss is primarily due to $50.7 million in impairment charges as well as $15.7 million in restructuring charges. Excluding impairment and restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $39.9 million. Exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted operating income by $0.2 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet non-operating income (expense). Net non-operating expense was $2.9 million for 2017, compared to net non-operating income of $2.5 million for 2016.\nNet interest income was $0.4 million in 2017, a $0.2 million increase from net interest income of $0.2 million in 2016.\nOther, net was expense of $3.3 million in 2017 and income of $2.3 million in 2016.

We help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment, management and development of senior executives. We believe focusing on top-level services offers us several advantages that include access to and influence with key decision makers, increased potential for recurring search consulting engagements, higher fees per search, enhanced brand visibility, and a leveraged global footprint, which create added barriers to entry for potential competitors. Working at the top of client organizations also allows us to attract and retain high-caliber consultants.\nIn addition to executive search, we provide leadership consulting expertise and culture shaping services including executive leadership assessment; leadership, team and board development; succession planning; talent strategy; people performance; inter-team collaboration; and organizational transformation.\nWe have announced the combination of our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping businesses to create Heidrick Consulting, a comprehensive offering of the firm's advisory services. We anticipate that our Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping reportable segments will be combined into one reportable segment, Heidrick Consulting, during the first quarter of 2018.\nWe provide our services to a broad range of clients through the expertise of over 380 consultants located in major cities around the world. Our executive search services are provided on a retained basis. Revenue before reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses ( net revenue\u201d) consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients. Typically, we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one-third of the estimated first year compensation for the position to be filled.

Specific to Executive Search, our largest business, consultant productivity measured by net executive search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Average revenue per executive search was $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating loss as a percentage of net revenue was 4.3% in 2017 compared to operating margin of 6.0% in 2016. The change in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net revenue of $39.0 million, which was offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense of $34.1 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.2 million, impairment charges of $50.7 million and restructuring charges of $15.7 million. Salaries and employee benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue was 69.9% in 2017 and 68.7% in 2016. General and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 23.7% in 2017 and 25.3% in 2016\nWe ended the year with combined cash and cash equivalents of $207.5 million, an increase of $42.5 million compared to $165.0 million at December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily due increased cash collections and lower acquisition investments. These increases in cash were partially offset by cash paid for restructuring charges. We pay the majority of bonuses in the first quarter following the year in which they were earned. Employee bonuses are accrued throughout the year and are based on the Company's performance and the performance of the individual employee. We expect to pay approximately\n$148.0 million in bonuses related to 2017 performance in March and April 2018. In January 2018, we paid approximately $13.0 million in cash bonuses deferred in prior years.\n2018 Outlook\nWe are currently forecasting 2018 first quarter net revenue of between $150 million and $160 million. Our 2018 first quarter guidance is based upon, among other things, management's assumptions for the anticipated volume of new executive search confirmations and leadership consulting and culture shaping projects, the current backlog, consultant productivity, consultant retention, the seasonality of our business and average currency rates from December 2017.\nOur 2018 first quarter guidance is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those disclosed under Risk Factors (See Item 1A.

ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016\nTotal revenue. Consolidated total revenue increased $39.2 million, or 6.5%, to $640.1 million in 2017 from $600.9 million in 2016. The increase in total revenue was primarily due to the increase in revenue before reimbursements (net revenue).\nRevenue before reimbursements (net revenue). Consolidated net revenue increased $39.0 million or 6.7%, to $621.4 million in 2017 from $582.4 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which negatively impacted results by $1.4 million, or 0.2%, consolidated net revenue increased $40.4 million, or 6.9%. Executive Search net revenue was $552.0 million in 2017, an increase of $44.7 million compared to 2016. The increase in Executive Search net revenue was the result of growth in the Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Leadership Consulting net revenue increased $2.4 million, or 6.2%, to $41.2 million in 2017 from $38.8 million in 2016. Culture Shaping net revenue was $28.1 million in 2017, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 22.3%, compared to 2016.\nThe number of Executive Search, Leadership Consulting and Culture Shaping consultants was 346, 19 and 17, respectively, as of December 31, 2017 compared to 335, 22 and 17, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Specific to Executive Search, our largest business, productivity as measured by annualized net Executive Search revenue per consultant was $1.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The number of confirmed searches increased 4.5% compared to 2016. The average revenue per executive search increased to $120,300 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117,700 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits. Consolidated salaries and employee benefits expense increased $34.1 million, or 8.5%, to $434.2 million in 2017 from $400.1 million in 2016. The increase was due to higher variable compensation of $23.2 million and higher fixed compensation of $10.9 million. Fixed compensation increased due to higher average headcount due to our recent acquisitions, new hires over the last year, and the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $1.5 million. Variable compensation increased due to increased production over the prior year. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which positively impacted results by $0.4 million, or 0.1%, consolidated salaries and benefits expense increased $34.5 million, or 8.6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn 2017, we had an average of 1,798 employees, compared to an average of 1,716 employees in 2016. As a percentage of net revenue, salaries and employee benefits expense was 69.9% in 2017, compared to 68.7% in 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. Consolidated general and administrative expenses increased $0.2 million, or 0.2%, to $147.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $147.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which positively impacted results by $0.8 million, or 0.5%, consolidated general and administrative expenses increased $1.0 million, or 0.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses were 23.7% in 2017, compared to 25.3% in 2016.\nImpairment charges. In 2017, the Culture Shaping business continued the transition of senior-level personnel which began in 2016, primarily due to planned retirements. The Company has experienced lower than expected consultant productivity during the transition period. Also, the marketplace for culture shaping services has become increasingly more competitive and the business experienced lengthening sales cycles and decision processes within target client organizations. These events led to a decline in the revenue performance of the business and uncertainty around the timing of improving such performance. As a result, the Company identified a triggering event and performed an interim impairment evaluation on the goodwill and intangible assets related to its Culture Shaping reporting unit during the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Based on the results of the impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Culture Shaping reporting unit were impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $39.2 million to write-off all of the goodwill and intangible assets.\nAdditionally, based on the results of the annual impairment evaluation, performed by the Company as of October 31, 2017, the Company determined that the goodwill and intangible assets within the Leadership Consulting reporting unit were impaired, which resulted in an impairment charge of $11.6 million to write-off all of the goodwill and intangible assets. Throughout the year, the Company was continually evaluating the results of its Leadership Consulting business, including Philosophy IB failing to achieve targets outlined in its earnout agreement and the potential impact of the conclusion of the Co Company earnout on the reporting unit. In the fourth quarter, the Company finalized its assessment of these events and its forecast for the Leadership Consulting reporting unit in future years. The forecast for the Leadership Consulting reporting unit indicated significant uncertainty around the pace and timing of growth in profitability in the Leadership Consulting reporting unit as the Company invests in talent and service offerings, which resulted in the impairment of the Leadership Consulting goodwill.\nThe aforementioned impairment charges of $50.7 million are recorded within Impairment charges in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. The impairments were non-cash in nature and did not affect our current liquidity, cash flows, borrowing capability or operations; nor did they impact the debt covenants under our credit agreement.\nRestructuring charges During the fourth quarter, the Company announced a restructuring plan to reduce overall costs and improve efficiencies in its operations. As a result of this plan, the Company incurred approximately $15.7 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include approximately $13.1 million in severance related charges, $2.3 million in professional fees and other expenses and $0.3 million in office related charges.\nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income was a loss of $26.5 million in 2017, compared to income of $35.2 million in 2016. The operating loss is primarily due to $50.7 million in impairment charges as well as $15.7 million in restructuring charges. Excluding impairment and restructuring charges, the Company reported operating income of $39.9 million. Exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted operating income by $0.2 million, or 0.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet non-operating income (expense). Net non-operating expense was $2.9 million for 2017, compared to net non-operating income of $2.5 million for 2016.\nNet interest income was $0.4 million in 2017, a $0.2 million increase from net interest income of $0.2 million in 2016.\nOther, net was expense of $3.3 million in 2017 and income of $2.3 million in 2016. Other, net results declined primarily due to the HMRC employee benefit tax settlement of $2.4 million.\nIncome taxes. See Note 16, Income Taxes.\nExecutive Search\nAmericas\nThe Americas segment reported net revenue of $339.8 million in 2017, an increase of 8.5% from $313.3 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 5.7% increase in the number of executive search confirmations compared to the prior year as well as an increase in consultant headcount. All practice groups contributed to the increased net revenue. The number of consultants was 163 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 158 as of December 31, 2016.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $16.5 million from 2016. Fixed compensation increased $4.4 million primarily due to higher base salaries and payroll taxes of $3.8 million, higher separation costs of $0.5 million and higher stock compensation expense of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation of $1.1 million. Variable compensation increased $12.1 million primarily due to higher bonus accruals for consultant performance.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1.6 million primarily due to increased professional service fees and office occupancy expenses, partially offset by lower hiring fees and temporary labor.\nThe Americas incurred approximately $0.8 million in restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2017. These charges include approximately $0.6 million in severance related charges and $0.2 million in professional fees and other expenses.\nOperating income was $81.5 million in 2017, an increase of $7.7 million compared to $73.9 million in 2016. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the Americas segment reported operating income of $82.3 million.\nEurope\nEurope reported net revenue of $125.3 million in 2017, an increase of 15.3% from $108.8 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 6.2% increase in the number of executive search confirmations as compared to the prior year and an increase in consultant headcount. Our acquisition of JCA Group in August 2016 also contributed to the year-over-year growth in net revenue. Excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which negatively impacted results by $1.0 million, or 0.8%, net revenue increased $17.6 million, or 16.2%.
