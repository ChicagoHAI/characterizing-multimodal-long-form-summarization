With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technology solutions sold under several market-leading and well-established brands to our global customer base. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nOur solutions are designed to ensure that our customers have the quantity and quality of water that meets their unique specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We deliver and maintain these mission critical solutions through the largest service network in North America, assuring our customers continuous uptime with 92 service branches as of September 30, 2020. We have an extensive service and support network, and as a result, we have certified Evoqua Service Technicians within approximately a two-hour drive from more than 90% of our industrial North American customers' sites.\nOur vision to be the world's first choice for water solutions\u201d and our values of integrity, customers, performance and sustainable\u201d foster a corporate culture that is focused on establishing a workforce that is enabled, empowered and accountable, which creates a highly entrepreneurial and dynamic work environment. Our purpose is Transforming water. Enriching life.\u201d We draw from a long legacy of water treatment innovations and industry firsts, supported by more than 1,300 granted or pending patents, which in aggregate are imperative to our business. Our core technologies are primarily focused on removing impurities from water, rather than neutralizing them through the addition of chemicals, and we are able to achieve purification levels which are 1,000 times greater than typical drinking water.\nBusiness Segments\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, we served our customers through two segments: Integrated Solutions and Services, a group entirely focused on engaging directly with end users, and Applied Product Technologies, a group focused on developing product platforms to be sold primarily through third party channels. Our segments draw from the same reservoir of leading technologies, shared manufacturing infrastructure, common business processes and corporate philosophies. The key factors used to identify our reportable segments are the organization and alignment of our internal operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Within the Integrated Solutions and Services segment, we primarily provide tailored solutions in collaboration with our customers backed by life-cycle services including on-demand water, outsourced water (formerly\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nknown as build-own-operated), recycle and reuse and emergency response service alternatives to improve operational reliability, performance and environmental compliance.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Within the Applied Product Technologies segment, we provide a highly differentiated and scalable range of products and technologies specified by global water treatment designers, OEMs, engineering firms and integrators.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We evaluate our business segments' operating results based on income from operations and net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) on a segment basis. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of inter-segment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges, which have not been allocated to business segments. As such, the segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies. In addition, our chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. Adjusted EBITDA of the reportable segments does not include certain unallocated charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These unallocated charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and share-based compensation charges.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our segments accounted for the following percentage of our revenues:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integrated Solutions and Services segment\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applied Product Technologies segment\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrganic Growth Drivers\nMarket Growth\nWe maintain a leading position among customers in growing industries that utilize water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking and wastewater, marine and aquatics. Water treatment is an essential, non-discretionary market that is growing in importance as access to clean water has become an international priority. Underpinning this growth are a number of global, long-term trends that have resulted in increasingly stringent effluent regulations, along with a growing demand for cleaner and sustainable waste streams for reuse. These trends include the growing global population, increasing levels of urbanization and continued global economic growth, and we have seen these trends manifest themselves within our various end markets creating multiple avenues of growth. For example, within the industrial market, water is an integral and meaningful component in the production of a wide-range of goods spanning from consumer electronics to automobiles.\nOur Existing Customer Base\nWe believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers' water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end-markets and under-penetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross-selling to existing customers. We believe we are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our core markets, with over 200,000 installations across over 38,000 global customers. We maintain a customer-intimate business model with strong brand value and provide solutions-focused offerings capable of serving a customer's full lifecycle water treatment needs, both in current and new geographic regions.\nOur Service Model\nWe selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed internet-connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our WaterOne\u00ae service platform, which enables customers to outsource their water treatment systems and focus on their core business, offering customers system optimization, predictive and proactive service, and simplified billing and pricing. Our WaterOne\u00ae platform also enables us to transition our customers to pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our technology solutions provide customers with increased stability and predictability in water-related costs, while enabling us to optimize our service route network and on demand offerings through predictive analytics, which we believe will result in market share gains, improved service levels, increased barriers to entry and reduced costs.\nProduct and Technology Development\nWe develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, vertical market and geography-expanding, technology-enhancing acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a strong pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value-enhancing solutions. Furthermore, since April 2016, we have successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, strengthening our existing capabilities and adding new capabilities and cross selling opportunities in areas such as mobile wastewater treatment, soil and air treatment, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV and ozone disinfection, aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies and electrochemical and electrochlorination cells. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best-in-class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.\nOperational Excellence\nWe believe that continuous improvement of our operations, processes and organizational structure is a key driver of our earnings growth. We have identified and are pursuing several discrete initiatives that, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next two years. These initiatives include our supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, capturing benefits of our WaterOne\u00ae platform and further optimizing our engineering cost structure, our global shared services organization and our sales, inventory and operations planning, including footprint rationalization. These improvements focus on creating value for customers through reduced leadtimes, improved quality and superior customer support, while also creating value for shareholders through enhanced earnings growth. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we believe we have the capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increase in fixed costs.\nAcquisitions\nWe believe that capex-like, tuck-in acquisitions present a key opportunity within our overall growth strategy, which we will continue to evaluate strategically. These strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate our growth by extending the critical mass in existing markets as well as expand in new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, best-in-class channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive rapid growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has, since April 2016, successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, with purchase prices ranging from approximately $2.0 million to approximately $283.7 million, and pre-acquisition revenues ranging from approximately $2.1 million to approximately $55.7 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, we acquired a 60% investment position in San Diego-based Frontier Water Systems, LLC ( Frontier\u201d), completed the sale of the Memcor product line to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. ( DuPont\u201d), and acquired the assets of privately held Aquapure Technologies ( Aquapure\u201d). The aggregate purchase price paid by DuPont for the Memcor product line was $110.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Following adjustments for cash and net working capital, gross proceeds paid by DuPont were $131.0 million. The Company recognized a $57.7 million net pre-tax benefit on the sale of the Memcor product line, net of $8.3 million of discretionary compensation payments to employees in connection with the transaction and $2.1 million in transaction costs incurred. The Company and DuPont have a history of collaboration, and following the sale, DuPont continues to supply the Company with Memcor products. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of ATG UV Technology Limited ( ATG UV\u201d). See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d in Item 8 in this Annual Report for a complete discussion.\nWe will continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy. We maintain a robust pipeline of potential acquisition targets, developed by our management team as well as various outside industry experts and consultants.\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business has been considered essential under federal and local standards, and we have maintained business continuity at our critical service branches and manufacturing facilities to date. We have taken measures to protect our employees, including implementation of remote working practices where possible and managing our supply chain to ensure that necessary personal protective equipment is available to our personnel. We have also taken certain cost reduction actions, some of which are temporary in nature, such as reduction of marketing travel activity as well as deferment of headcount additions to preserve liquidity and reallocated existing resources to maintain productivity levels where feasible.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on our business and how the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic might affect our customers' willingness to make capital expenditures and our ability to collect from our customers.\nFor more information regarding factors and events that may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises or pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in industrial, commercial and municipal spending impact our business. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote industrial, commercial and municipal customer spending, while economic weakness results in a reduction of new industrial, commercial and municipal project activity. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include population growth, total water consumption, municipal budgets, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit or capital, interest rates, tax rates, imposition of tariffs and regulatory changes. Since the businesses of our customers vary in cyclicality, periodic downturns in any specific sector typically have modest impacts on our overall business. For example, the recent weakness in global oil markets has created, and may continue to create, some weakness in demand from customers that we serve in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and may result in a sustained global recession.\nChanges in costs and availability. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, including steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate and iridium, and volatility in the market price and availability of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs and our business. For example, restrictions on international trade, including tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and other governments, as well as supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased and could further increase the cost of certain materials and have restricted and could further restrict availability of certain commodities, which may result in delays in our execution of projects. Although we have offset a portion of these\ncost increases through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to recuperate additional cost increases from our customers through product price increases. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin. Further, additional potential acquisitions and international expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our management systems, financial and management controls and information systems. We will also be required to hire, train and retain operational and sales personnel, which affects our operating margins.\nInflation and deflation trends. Our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our revenues as well as greater margin pressure as increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers.\nFluctuation in quarterly results. Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including funding, readiness of projects, regulatory approvals and significant weather events. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for industrial, commercial and municipal applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nNew products and technologies. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling array of products, services and solutions responsive to evolving customer innovations, preferences and specifications. We expect that increased use of water in industrial and commercial processes will drive increased customer demand in the future, and our ability to grow will depend in part on effectively responding to innovation in our customers' processes and systems. Further, our ability to provide products that comply with evolving government regulations will also be a driver of the appeal of our products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial customers.\nGovernment policies. Decaying water systems in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) will require critical drinking water and wastewater repairs, often led by municipal governments. Further, as U.S. states increase regulation on existing and emerging contaminants, we expect that our customers will increasingly require sustainable solutions to their water-related needs. In general, increased infrastructure investment and more stringent municipal, state and federal regulations promote increased spending on our products, services and solutions, while a slowdown in investment in public infrastructure or the elimination of key environmental regulations could result in lower industrial and municipal spending on water systems and products.\nAvailability of water. In general, we expect demand for our products and services to increase as the availability of clean water from public sources decreases. Secular trends that will drive demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. Because water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development, we expect that, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for our equipment and services will continue to increase.\nOperational investment. Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have made significant investments in our business that we believe have laid the foundation for continued profitable growth. Activities related to operational investments include employee training and development, integrating acquired businesses, implementing enhanced information systems, research, development and engineering investments and other activities to enable us to support our operating model.\nOur ability to source and distribute products effectively. Our revenues are affected by our ability to purchase our inputs in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our suppliers have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenues could be adversely affected in the event of constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our suppliers to produce sufficient quantities of raw materials in a manner that is able to match demand from our customers.\nContractual relationships with customers. Due to our large installed base and the nature of our contractual relationships with our customers, we have high visibility into a large portion of our revenue. The one- to twenty-year terms of many of our service contracts and the regular delivery and replacement of many of our products help to insulate us from the negative impact of any economic decline.\nExchange rates. The reporting currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the U.S. dollar. We operate in numerous countries around the world and therefore, certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, U.K. sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. While we believe we are not susceptible to any material impact on our results of operations caused by fluctuations in exchange rates because our operations are primarily conducted in the U.S., if we expand our foreign operations in the future, substantial increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as described more fully and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure below).\nRevenue\nOur sales are a function of sales volumes and selling prices, each of which is a function of the mix of product and service sales, and consist primarily of:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sales of tailored light industry technologies, heavy industry technologies and environmental products, services and solutions in collaboration with our industrial customers, backed by lifecycle services including emergency response services and outsourced water alternatives, to a broad group of industrial customers in our U.S., Canada and Singapore markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sales of products, services and solutions to engineering firms and municipalities to purify drinking water and treat wastewater globally; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sales of a wide variety of differentiated products and technologies, to an array of OEM, distributor, end-user, engineering firm and integrator customers in all of our geographic markets and aftermarket channels.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is determined by subtracting cost of product sales and cost of services from our product and services revenue. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our combined product and services revenue.\nCost of product sales consists of all manufacturing costs required to bring a product to a ready for sale condition, including direct and indirect materials, direct and indirect labor costs including benefits, freight, depreciation, information technology, rental and insurance, repair and maintenance, utilities, other manufacturing costs, warranties and third party commissions.\nCost of services primarily consists of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technicians, depreciation of equipment and field service vehicles and freight costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist primarily of the following:\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses ( G&A expense\u201d) consist of fixed overhead personnel expenses associated with our corporate functions and our service organization (including district and branch managers, customer service, contract renewals and regeneration plant management). We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses ( S&M expense\u201d) consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products, services and solutions and related personnel expenses (including all Evoqua sales and application employees' base compensation and incentives), as well as sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, display expenses and related amortization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to actively promote our products, services and solutions.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses ( R&D expense\u201d) consist primarily of personnel expenses related to research and development, patents, sustaining engineering, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and overhead costs allocated to such expenses. Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nR&D expense can fluctuate depending on our determination to invest in developing new products, services and solutions and enhancing our existing products, services and solutions versus adding these capabilities through a mergers and acquisitions strategy. R&D expenditures are concentrated in our products businesses.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) is determined by subtracting operating expenses and interest expense from, and adding other operating income (expense), equity income from our partnership interest in Treated Water Outsourcing and income tax benefit (expense) to gross profit. For more information on how we determine gross profit, see Gross Profit.\u201d\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is one of the metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash share-based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains, losses and expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and provides greater clarity to management and our investors regarding the operational impact of long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to make budgeting decisions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable operating segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of the reportable operating segments does not include certain charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and share-based compensation charges.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>107.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and related business transformation costs (a)\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation (b)\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs (c)\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sponsor fees (d)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (gains) losses and expenses (e)\n</td> <td>(65.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Restructuring and related business transformation costs\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted EBITDA is calculated prior to considering certain restructuring or business transformation events.

Such costs may include, without limitation, consulting and legal costs associated with due diligence and closing a transaction, restructuring and integration costs such as severance, facility consolidation costs, product rationalization or inventory obsolescence charges, system integration or conversion costs, fair value changes associated with contingent consideration, and costs associated with any litigation matters that arise subsequent to our acquisition of a business for which the matter in question preceded the transaction, but was not known, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. We believe that viewing earnings prior to considering these charges provides investors with useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with business combinations result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees - a natural result of acquiring or disposing a fully integrated set of activities. Integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years.

Such significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of their nature and they may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business, items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis, items that would be non-recurring, or items related to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as other (gains), losses and expenses would be amounts related to non-cash foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany loans, significant warranty events, and certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under GAAP.

This decrease in product sales was primarily due to the divestiture of the Memcor product line of $44.4 million in the current year. Aftermarket product revenues declined $40.7 million in the current year and was related to the divestiture of the Memcor product line as well as site closures and delays due to COVID-19. The aftermarket revenue decrease was offset by an increase in capital revenues of $29.5 million. This increase was primarily related to projects in the microelectronics end market as well as $15.7 million related to the acquisitions of ATG UV and Frontier.\nRevenues from services decreased $3.7 million, or 0.6% from the prior year. This decrease was driven by the impact of COVID-19 shut-downs and delays, primarily in refining and oil and gas end markets, as well as the timing of completion of certain large projects in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by price realization related to established service contracts.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin-Total gross margin increased to 31.5% in the year ended September 30, 2020 from 29.5% in the prior year. The following table provides the change in cost of product sales and cost of services, respectively, along with related gross margins:\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nMargin %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gross\nMargin %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(588.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(615.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>(391.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(403.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(979.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,018.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe gross margin for product sales increased 2.3% from the prior year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by costs incurred in the prior year of $8.2 million related to restructuring and product rationalization, that did not reoccur in the current year.\nGross margin from services increased 1.6% from the prior year. This increase is mainly driven by price realization recognized in revenue as well as continued focus on labor productivity even as previous increases in revenue volumes were offset in the current period.\nOperating Expenses-Operating expenses decreased $29.3 million, or 7.9%, to $342.0 million in year ended September 30, 2020 from $371.3 million in the prior year. The decrease is mainly due to favorable change in foreign currency\ntranslation on intercompany loans of $20.1 million along with a decrease in share-based compensation expense of $9.5 million. In addition, the divestiture of the Memcor product line resulted in a decrease of $7.5 million of operating expenses in the current year. This decrease was partially offset by increased costs of $10.2 million of employment and benefit expenses and increased costs of $7.6 million related to the addition of operating expenses as a result of the ATG UV and Frontier acquisitions, mainly due to amortization expense on purchased intangibles. The remaining decrease is due to various efforts taken by the Company to reduce costs across various areas in response to COVID-19 uncertainties, such as reduced travel and consulting costs.\nA discussion of operating expenses by category is as follows:\nResearch and Development Expense-Research and development expense decreased $2.1 million, or 13.7%, to $13.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $15.3 million in the prior year due to the Company's continued efforts to reduce spending, offset partially by increased expenses by the addition of the Frontier acquisition.\nSales and Marketing Expense-Sales and marketing expense decreased $2.7 million, or 1.9%, to $136.2 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $138.9 million in the prior year mainly due to a reduction in sales and marketing expenses related to the divestiture of the Memcor product line in the current year, as well as a reduction in certain marketing initiatives and travel related expenses, offset by increased costs for salaries and incentive compensation and the addition of the Frontier acquisition.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense-General and administrative expense decreased $24.5 million, or 11.3%, to $192.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $217.1 million in the prior year. This decrease is primarily due to:\n\u2022favorable change in foreign currency translation on the intercompany loans of $19.6 million\n\u2022reduction in share-based compensation expense of $9.2 million\n\u2022reduction in consulting fees of $4.4 million\n\u2022reduction in travel expenses of $4.3 million\n\u2022reduction in benefits of $3.7 million\nThe above factors were partially offset by:\n\u2022increased employee related costs of $8.8 million\n\u2022increased costs of $4.3 million related to the Frontier acquisition\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of $1.8 million incurred related to the secondary public offering of shares of common stock held by certain shareholders of the Company\n</td> </tr>\n</table> \u2022restructuring costs of $1.9 million following the sale of the Memcor product line\nOther Operating Income, Net-Other operating income, net increased $55.6 million, to income of $60.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from income of $5.0 million in the prior year. The increase is mainly due to the net pre-tax benefit of $57.7 million on sale of the Memcor product line net of $8.3 million of discretionary compensation payments to employees in connection with the transaction and $2.1 million in transaction costs incurred in the current year.\nInterest Expense-Interest expense decreased $12.0 million, or 20.5%, to $46.6 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $58.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by a reduction in LIBOR year over year in addition to a $100.0 million debt repayment that occurred in the current year, partially offset by a write-off of deferred financing fees related to the debt paydown and interest expense associated with additional equipment financings.\nIncome Tax Expense-Income tax expense was $7.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020, compared to expense of $9.6 million in the prior year. The decrease in expense was primarily the result of the favorable impact on deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite lived intangibles, a portion of which were reversed in relation to the sale of the Memcor product line.\nNet Income (loss) -Net income increased by $122.9 million, or 1,445.9%, to net income of $114.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 from a net loss of $8.5 million in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the sale of the Memcor product line, which resulted in a gain on sale of $68.1 million, less amounts paid for discretionary bonuses of $8.3 million and transaction costs of $2.1 million. The resulting net pre-tax benefit was $57.7 million. In addition to the net benefit of the sale, we saw operational efficiencies and a favorable change in foreign currency translation resulting in a net gain of $20.8 million. Finally, interest expense and income tax expense decreased by $12.0 million and $2.2 million, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA-Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.6 million, or 2.0%, to $239.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 from $235.0 million for the prior year. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by operational efficiencies.\nSegment Results\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Variance\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integrated Solutions and Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>944.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>910.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applied Product Technologies\n</td> <td>485.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>533.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,429.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,444.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integrated Solutions and Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applied Product Technologies\n</td> <td>134.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(111.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Integrated Solutions and Services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>205.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applied Product Technologies\n</td> <td>148.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and unallocated costs\n</td> <td>(85.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(135.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Consolidated\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA on a segment basis is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for the impact of certain other items that have been reflected at the segment level.

Our recent investment in Frontier resulted in an increase of $4.9 million of revenue. These increases were offset by a reduction in aftermarket revenue of $3.7 million and a reduction in service revenue of $1.2 million. The segment also saw an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $0.7 million.\nOperating profit in the Integrated Solutions and Services segment decreased $2.9 million, or 2.0%, to $145.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $148.6 million in the prior year. Segment profitability improved $20.9 million in the period primarily driven by higher organic revenue volume, augmented by improved pricing, which was\npartially offset by $6.0 million of operational variances in the year related to lower service volumes and productivity due to customer shutdowns and enhanced safety protocols. The current period negative impacts were partially mitigated by $2.9 million of cost containment measures implemented in response to the uncertainties of COVID-19. Profitability in the current year was also favorably impacted by the non-recurrence of $0.5 million of charges related to the achievement of earn-out targets associated with the Pure Water acquisition. Profitability was also impacted by increased employment and benefit expenses of $11.0 million. Additional negative drivers to profitability included $10.2 million from higher depreciation and amortization.\nEBITDA in the Integrated Solutions and Services segment increased $7.3 million, or 3.5%, to $213.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $205.8 million in the prior year.\nApplied Product Technologies\nRevenues in the Applied Product Technologies segment decreased by $48.3 million, or 9.1%, to $485.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $533.6 million in the prior year. The divestiture of the Memcor product line resulted in a reduction in revenue of $51.2 million in the current period. This reduction was partially offset by increased revenues from the acquisition of ATG UV of $10.8 million. Additionally, revenues were down by $11.5 million in the Americas predominantly due to COVID-19 slowdown and delays. The segment also saw an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $1.1 million. These declines were partially offset by revenue growth of $3.2 million and $1.5 million in the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions respectively.\nOperating profit in the Applied Product Technologies segment increased $64.9 million, or 93.5%, to $134.3 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $69.4 million in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to the net pre-tax benefit on the sale of the Memcor product line of $57.7 million, net of $8.3 million of discretionary compensation payments to employees in connection with the transaction and $2.1 million in transaction costs incurred. In addition, revenue volume and operational variances increased operating profit by $2.1 million, which is comprised of favorable operational variances of $7.1 million, as well as product mix augmented by improved pricing, partially offset by volume, netting to $2.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a net reduction in operating profit of $5.5 million related to the divestiture of the Memcor product line and the acquisition of ATG UV as well as increased inflation and employee related costs of $1.6 million. The increase in operating profit was also due to lower depreciation of $3.5 million. Further increases were due to net reduction in nonrecurring costs of $1.7 million related to:\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduction in costs incurred by the Company of $4.9 million related to the write-off of inventory in the prior year associated with product rationalization and facility consolidation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A $3.6 million reduction in costs incurred by the Company from a settlement with a third-party vendor associated with remediation of manufacturing defects caused by the vendor;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reductions in costs of $1.4 million related to the achievement of earn-out targets associated with certain acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reductions in product rationalization costs of $3.0 million related to charges incurred by the Company in its electro-chlorination business;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A gain on sale recorded in the prior year of $0.4 million which did not reoccur in the current year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increases in restructuring charges of $8.0 million primarily due to costs incurred following the sale of the Memcor product line; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Release of an acquisition related contingency due to the passage of time in the prior year for $2.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Operating profit was also reduced by foreign currency of $0.1 million.\nEBITDA in the Applied Product Technologies segment increased $61.4 million, or 70.5%, to $148.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from $87.1 million in the prior year.\nFor a discussion of the results of operations for the years ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 refer to the Results of Operations included in Item 7. in the Company's 10-K filed with the SEC on November 25, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations, including working capital needs, debt service, acquisitions, other commitments and contractual obligations. We consider liquidity in terms of cash flows from operations and their sufficiency to fund our operating and investing activities.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under our $125.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Historically, we have financed our operations primarily from cash generated from operations and increased equipment financings. Our primary cash needs are for day to day operations, to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, to fund working capital requirements and to make capital expenditures.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including occasional extensions of payment terms. We also facilitate a voluntary supply chain finance program (the Finance Program\u201d) to provide certain of our suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from us to participating financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the suppliers and the financial institutions. A third party administers the Finance Program; our responsibility is limited to making payment on the terms originally negotiated with our supplier, regardless of whether the supplier sells its receivable to a financial institution. We do not enter into agreements with any of the participating financial institutions in connection with the Finance Program. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Finance Program. The September 30 year to date amounts settled through the Finance Program and paid to participating financial institutions were $38.9 million, and $8.6 million in fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019, respectively. A downgrade in our credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions' willingness to commit to participation in the Finance Program.\nWe expect to continue to finance our liquidity requirements through internally generated funds and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe that our projected cash flows generated from operations, together with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are sufficient to fund our principal debt payments, interest expense, our working capital needs and our expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Our capital expenditures for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $88.5 million and $88.9 million, respectively. However, our budgeted capital expenditures can vary from period to period based on the nature of capital intensive project awards. We may draw on our Revolving Credit Facility from time to time to fund or partially fund an acquisition.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we had total indebtedness of $885.5 million, including $819.3 million of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, $63.9 million in borrowings related to equipment financings, $0.6 million of notes payable related to certain equipment related contracts and $1.7 million related to a mortgage. We also had $13.0 million of letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $52 thousand of letters of credit issued under a separate uncommitted facility as of September 30, 2020.\nOur senior secured credit facilities contain a number of covenants imposing certain restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions these covenants place on our business operations, include limitations on our or our subsidiaries' ability to:\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make certain investments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>agree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into transactions with our affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 213: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur liens; or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We are a holding company and do not conduct any business operations of our own. As a result, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions and other transfers from our operating subsidiaries. Under the terms of our senior secured credit facilities, our operating subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to us, and we expect these limitations to continue in the future under the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our Revolving Credit Facility, but not the First Lien Term Loan, contains a financial covenant which requires us to comply with the maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 5.55 to 1.00 as of the last day of any quarter on which the aggregate amount of revolving loans and letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility (net of cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn outstanding letters of credit in an amount of up to 50% of the Revolving Credit Facility) exceeds 25% of the total commitments thereunder.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the senior secured credit facilities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk and prevent us from meeting our obligations.

This increase was largely driven by proceeds from the sale of the Memcor product line in fiscal 2020, partially offset by higher cash outflow associated with the Frontier and Aquapure acquisitions that occurred in fiscal 2020. Other activity related to purchase of capital or intangible assets remained relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased $95.2 million to $89.5 million in the year ended September 30, 2020 from net cash provided by financing activities of $5.7 million in the year ended September 30, 2019. This additional amount of cash used in financing activities for year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to the $100 million debt payment, which was offset by cash received from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. In addition, there was an increase in the issuance of debt and higher borrowings under the credit facility and other financing arrangements that occurred in 2019.\nSeasonality\nOur business may exhibit seasonality resulting from our customers' increasing demand for our products and services during the spring and summer months as compared to the fall and winter months. For example, our business servicing municipal customers experiences increased demand for our odor control product lines and services in the warmer months which, together with other factors, typically results in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year. Inclement weather, such as hurricanes, droughts and floods, can also drive increased demand for our products and services. As a result, our results from operations may vary from period to period.\nSeasonal trends historically displayed by our business could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and past performance should not be considered indicative of future results. For example, decreased customer demand resulting from the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic and the measures taken to control its spread could negate the seasonal factors that have historically resulted in improved performance in the second half of our fiscal year.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had letters of credit totaling $13.0 million outstanding under our credit arrangements. In addition, as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, we had surety bonds totaling $153.0 million and $144.7 million, respectively, outstanding under our credit arrangements. The longest maturity date of the letters of credit and surety bonds in effect as of September 30, 2020 was March 20, 2030.\nContractual Obligations\nWe enter into long-term obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations and non-cancelable operating leases.

Management evaluates its accounting policies, estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and various other factors that are believed to be relevant at the time Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nManagement evaluated the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates and believes that the following involve a higher degree of judgment, complexity or uncertainty and are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position, and are therefore discussed as critical. The following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other than the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the current year. More information on all of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nAcquisitions and Purchase Price Allocation\nWe record acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, be recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the purchase method of accounting requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration. These assumptions and estimates include a market participant's use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Our estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and with the assistance of independent third-party appraisal firms. Significant assumptions and estimates include quoted market prices, carrying values, and expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty, and the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of estimates used in purchase accounting. The purchase price allocation recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.\nWe record contingent consideration arrangements at fair value on a recurring basis as earn-outs related to acquisitions. The fair value of earn-outs related to acquisitions is based on significant unobservable inputs including the achievement of certain performance metrics. Significant changes in these inputs would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair value of the earn-out each period until the related contingency has been resolved. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments in the probability of achieving future\ndevelopment steps, sales targets and profitability and are recorded in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nGoodwill Impairment Review\nWe review goodwill to determine potential impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. We have determined that we have three reporting units.\nThe fair values of reporting units are determined using a combination of two methods, one utilizing market revenue and earnings multiples derived from stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market applied to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit's financial performance (the market approach - guideline public company ( GPC\u201d) method), and the other derived from discounted cash flow models with estimated cash flows based on internal forecasts of revenues and expenses over a specified period plus a terminal value (the income approach discounted cash flows ( DCF\u201d) method). In estimating the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing a DCF valuation technique, we incorporate our judgment and estimates of future cash flows, future revenue and gross profit growth rates, terminal value amount, capital expenditures and applicable weighted-average cost of capital used to discount these estimated cash flows. The estimates and projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with our current budget and long-range plans, including anticipated change in market conditions, industry trends, growth rates and planned capital expenditures, among other considerations.\nWe believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two resulting values equally as an estimate of a reporting unit's fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing. However, we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so. If market conditions change compared to those used in our market approach, or if actual future results of operations fall below the projections used in the DCF method, our goodwill could become impaired in the future. As a result of our goodwill impairment assessment, we have concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of September 30, 2020, and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of an asset based on indicators of reduced profits or losses generated by the asset or asset group, a product recall or an adverse action by a regulator, such as a successful challenge of patent rights.\nWhen necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group. Fair value of long-lived assets are determined using an appraised value (obtained with the assistance of independent third-party appraisal firms) or using an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. Starting with a forecast of the expected future net cash flows associated with an asset or group of assets, we then apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. There were no material impairments of long-lived assets recorded in the current year.\nWe amortize long-lived assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. This amortization methodology best matches the pattern of economic benefit that is expected from definite-lived assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor sales of aftermarket parts or products with a low level of customization and engineering time, the Company recognizes revenues at the time risks and rewards of ownership pass, which is generally when products are shipped or delivered to the customer as the Company has no obligation for installation. The Company considers shipping and handling\nservices to be fulfillment activities and as such they do not represent separate performance obligations for revenue recognition. Sales of service arrangements are recognized as the services are performed.\nFor certain arrangements where there is significant customization to the product and for long-term construction-type sales contracts, revenue may be recognized over time as performance is completed. In these instances, revenue is recognized using a measure of progress that applies an input method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion (the percentage-of-completion method). These arrangements include large water treatment projects, systems and solutions for municipal and industrial applications. The nature of the contracts is generally fixed price with milestone billings. In order for revenue to be recognized over a period of time, the product must have no alternative use and the Company must have an enforceable right to payment for the performance completed to date, including a normal profit margin, in the event of termination for convenience. If these two criteria are not met, revenues from these contracts will not be recognized until construction is complete. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor, subcontractors costs and indirect costs related to contract performance. We believe this is the most accurate measure of contract performance because it directly measures the value of the goods and services transferred to the customer.\nThe percentage-of-completion method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of cost to complete for contracts in progress. Due to the nature of the work performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimates of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and may require significant judgment. In making such estimates, judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as weather, potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials, labor cost and productivity, the impact of change orders, liability claims, contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards. As a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we routinely review and update our significant contract estimates through a disciplined project review process in which management reviews the progress and execution of our performance obligations and estimates at completion. Contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised monthly and the cumulative effect of such adjustments are recognized in current operations. Such changes in contract estimates can result in the recognition of revenue in a current period for performance obligations which were satisfied or partially satisfied in a prior period. Changes in contract estimates may also result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue if the current estimate differs from the previous estimate. The amount of such adjustments have not been material.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In cases where we do not provide the distinct good or service on a standalone basis, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service. Our contracts are sometimes modified for changes in contract specifications and requirements. Judgment is required to determine if such modifications result in goods or services that are distinct from the existing contract. For customized products and long-term construction type contracts, most contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct due to the significant integration provided in the context of the contract and are accounted for as if they were part of the original contract on a cumulative catch-up basis. We account for contract modifications prospectively when it results in the promise to deliver additional goods and services that are distinct and the increase in price of the contract is for the same amount as the stand-alone selling price of the additional goods or services included in the modification.\nOur contracts sometimes contain variable consideration in the form of incentive fees, performance bonuses, award fees, liquidated damages or penalties. Other contract provisions also give rise to variable consideration such as claims and unpriced change orders that may either increase or decrease the transaction price. We estimate the amount of variable consideration at the most likely amount we expect to be entitled. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include such amounts in the transaction price are based largely on our assessment of legal enforceability, anticipated performance, and any other information (historical, current or forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Variable consideration associated with claims and unapproved change orders is included in the transaction price only to the extent of costs incurred.\nProduct Warranties\nAccruals for estimated expenses related to warranties are made at the time products are sold and are recorded as a component of cost of product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The estimated warranty obligation is based on product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs expected to be incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific obligations for known failures and other currently available evidence. We assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities on a regular basis and adjust amounts as necessary.\nDeferred Taxes, Valuation Allowances, and Tax Contingencies\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. We record a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more-likely-than-not to be realized within a reasonable period of time. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets.\nWe consider both positive and negative evidence when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. Available evidence includes historical financial information supplemented by currently available information about future years. Generally, historical financial information is more objectively verifiable than projections of future income and is therefore given more weight in our assessment. We consider cumulative losses in the most recent twelve quarters to be significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome in considering whether a valuation allowance is required. Conversely, we consider a cumulative income position over the most recent twelve quarters, to be significant positive evidence that a valuation allowance may not be required.\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed each balance sheet date. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 8, included in this Annual Report for a complete discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.", "summary": "This report provides an extensive discussion and analysis of the financial condition and operations of Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.

Factors that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and in Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company,\u201d Evoqua,\u201d Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.,\u201d EWT Holdings I Corp,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and similar terms refer to Evoqua Water Technologies Corp., together with its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts in this section are referred to in millions. Our fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year and references in this section to a year refer to our fiscal year. As such, references to: 2020 relates to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, 2019 relates to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 relates to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\nOverview and Background\nWe are a leading provider of mission critical water treatment solutions, offering services, systems and technologies to support our customers' full water lifecycle needs. With over 200,000 installations worldwide, we hold leading positions in the industrial, commercial and municipal water treatment markets in North America. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated, proprietary technology solutions sold under several market-leading and well-established brands to our global customer base. We have worked to protect water, the environment and our employees for over 100 years. As a result, we have earned a reputation for quality, safety and reliability and are sought out by our customers to solve the full range of their water treatment needs, and maintaining our reputation is critical to the success of our business.\nOur solutions are designed to ensure that our customers have the quantity and quality of water that meets their unique specifications. We enable our customers to achieve lower costs through greater uptime, throughput and efficiency in their operations and support their regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability. We deliver and maintain these mission critical solutions through the largest service network in North America, assuring our customers continuous uptime with 92 service branches as of September 30, 2020. We have an extensive service and support network, and as a result, we have certified Evoqua Service Technicians within approximately a two-hour drive from more than 90% of our industrial North American customers' sites.\nOur vision to be the world's first choice for water solutions\u201d and our values of integrity, customers, performance and sustainable\u201d foster a corporate culture that is focused on establishing a workforce that is enabled, empowered and accountable, which creates a highly entrepreneurial and dynamic work environment. Our purpose is Transforming water. Enriching life.\u201d We draw from a long legacy of water treatment innovations and industry firsts, supported by more than 1,300 granted or pending patents, which in aggregate are imperative to our business. Our core technologies are primarily focused on removing impurities from water, rather than neutralizing them through the addition of chemicals, and we are able to achieve purification levels which are 1,000 times greater than typical drinking water.\nBusiness Segments\nFor the year ended September 30, 2020, we served our customers through two segments: Integrated Solutions and Services, a group entirely focused on engaging directly with end users, and Applied Product Technologies, a group focused on developing product platforms to be sold primarily through third party channels. Our segments draw from the same reservoir of leading technologies, shared manufacturing infrastructure, common business processes and corporate philosophies. The key factors used to identify our reportable segments are the organization and alignment of our internal operations, the nature of the products and services and customer type.\n \u2022 Within the Integrated Solutions and Services segment, we primarily provide tailored solutions in collaboration with our customers backed by life-cycle services including on-demand water, outsourced water (formerly \nknown as build-own-operated), recycle and reuse and emergency response service alternatives to improve operational reliability, performance and environmental compliance.\n \u2022 Within the Applied Product Technologies segment, we provide a highly differentiated and scalable range of products and technologies specified by global water treatment designers, OEMs, engineering firms and integrators.  We evaluate our business segments' operating results based on income from operations and net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) on a segment basis. Corporate activities include general corporate expenses, elimination of inter-segment transactions, interest income and expense and other unallocated charges, which have not been allocated to business segments. As such, the segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies. In addition, our chief operating decision maker uses Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. Adjusted EBITDA of the reportable segments does not include certain unallocated charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These unallocated charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and share-based compensation charges.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our segments accounted for the following percentage of our revenues:\n\nOrganic Growth Drivers\nMarket Growth\nWe maintain a leading position among customers in growing industries that utilize water as a critical part of their operations or production processes, including pharmaceuticals and health sciences, microelectronics, food and beverage, hydrocarbon and chemical processing, power, general manufacturing, municipal drinking and wastewater, marine and aquatics. Water treatment is an essential, non-discretionary market that is growing in importance as access to clean water has become an international priority. Underpinning this growth are a number of global, long-term trends that have resulted in increasingly stringent effluent regulations, along with a growing demand for cleaner and sustainable waste streams for reuse. These trends include the growing global population, increasing levels of urbanization and continued global economic growth, and we have seen these trends manifest themselves within our various end markets creating multiple avenues of growth. For example, within the industrial market, water is an integral and meaningful component in the production of a wide-range of goods spanning from consumer electronics to automobiles.\nOur Existing Customer Base\nWe believe our strong brands, leading position in highly fragmented markets, scalable and global offerings, leading installed base and unique ability to provide complete treatment solutions will enable us to capture a larger share of our existing customers' water treatment spend while expanding with existing and new customers into adjacent end-markets and under-penetrated regions, including by investing in our sales force and cross-selling to existing customers. We believe we are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our core markets, with over 200,000 installations across over 38,000 global customers. We maintain a customer-intimate business model with strong brand value and provide solutions-focused offerings capable of serving a customer's full lifecycle water treatment needs, both in current and new geographic regions.\nOur Service Model\nWe selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed internet-connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our WaterOne\u00ae service platform, which enables customers to outsource their water treatment systems and focus on their core business, offering customers system optimization, predictive and proactive service, and simplified billing and pricing. Our WaterOne\u00ae platform also enables us to transition our customers to pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our technology solutions provide customers with increased stability and predictability in water-related costs, while enabling us to optimize our service route network and on demand offerings through predictive analytics, which we believe will result in market share gains, improved service levels, increased barriers to entry and reduced costs.\nProduct and Technology Development\nWe develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, vertical market and geography-expanding, technology-enhancing acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a strong pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value-enhancing solutions. Furthermore, since April 2016, we have successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, strengthening our existing capabilities and adding new capabilities and cross selling opportunities in areas such as mobile wastewater treatment, soil and air treatment, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV and ozone disinfection, aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies and electrochemical and electrochlorination cells. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best-in-class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.\nOperational Excellence\nWe believe that continuous improvement of our operations, processes and organizational structure is a key driver of our earnings growth. We have identified and are pursuing several discrete initiatives that, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next two years. These initiatives include our supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, capturing benefits of our WaterOne\u00ae platform and further optimizing our engineering cost structure, our global shared services organization and our sales, inventory and operations planning, including footprint rationalization. These improvements focus on creating value for customers through reduced leadtimes, improved quality and superior customer support, while also creating value for shareholders through enhanced earnings growth. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we believe we have the capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increase in fixed costs.\nAcquisitions\nWe believe that capex-like, tuck-in acquisitions present a key opportunity within our overall growth strategy, which we will continue to evaluate strategically. These strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate our growth by extending the critical mass in existing markets as well as expand in new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, best-in-class channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive rapid growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has, since April 2016, successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, with purchase prices ranging from approximately $2.0 million to approximately $283.7 million, and pre-acquisition revenues ranging from approximately $2.1 million to approximately $55.7 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, we acquired a 60% investment position in San Diego-based Frontier Water Systems, LLC ( Frontier\u201d), completed the sale of the Memcor product line to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. ( DuPont\u201d), and acquired the assets of privately held Aquapure Technologies ( Aquapure\u201d). The aggregate purchase price paid by DuPont for the Memcor product line was $110.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Following adjustments for cash and net working capital, gross proceeds paid by DuPont were $131.0 million. The Company recognized a $57.7 million net pre-tax benefit on the sale of the Memcor product line, net of $8.3 million of discretionary compensation payments to employees in connection with the transaction and $2.1 million in transaction costs incurred. The Company and DuPont have a history of collaboration, and following the sale, DuPont continues to supply the Company with Memcor products. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of ATG UV Technology Limited ( ATG UV\u201d). See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d in Item 8 in this Annual Report for a complete discussion.\nWe will continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy. We maintain a robust pipeline of potential acquisition targets, developed by our management team as well as various outside industry experts and consultants.\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business has been considered essential under federal and local standards, and we have maintained business continuity at our critical service branches and manufacturing facilities to date. We have taken measures to protect our employees, including implementation of remote working practices where possible and managing our supply chain to ensure that necessary personal protective equipment is available to our personnel. We have also taken certain cost reduction actions, some of which are temporary in nature, such as reduction of marketing travel activity as well as deferment of headcount additions to preserve liquidity and reallocated existing resources to maintain productivity levels where feasible.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on our business and how the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic might affect our customers' willingness to make capital expenditures and our ability to collect from our customers.\nFor more information regarding factors and events that may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises or pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in industrial, commercial and municipal spending impact our business. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote industrial, commercial and municipal customer spending, while economic weakness results in a reduction of new industrial, commercial and municipal project activity. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include population growth, total water consumption, municipal budgets, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit or capital, interest rates, tax rates, imposition of tariffs and regulatory changes. Since the businesses of our customers vary in cyclicality, periodic downturns in any specific sector typically have modest impacts on our overall business. For example, the recent weakness in global oil markets has created, and may continue to create, some weakness in demand from customers that we serve in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and may result in a sustained global recession.\nChanges in costs and availability. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, including steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate and iridium, and volatility in the market price and availability of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs and our business. For example, restrictions on international trade, including tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and other governments, as well as supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased and could further increase the cost of certain materials and have restricted and could further restrict availability of certain commodities, which may result in delays in our execution of projects. Although we have offset a portion of these\ncost increases through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to recuperate additional cost increases from our customers through product price increases. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin. Further, additional potential acquisitions and international expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our management systems, financial and management controls and information systems. We will also be required to hire, train and retain operational and sales personnel, which affects our operating margins.\nInflation and deflation trends. Our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our revenues as well as greater margin pressure as increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers.\nFluctuation in quarterly results. Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including funding, readiness of projects, regulatory approvals and significant weather events. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for industrial, commercial and municipal applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nNew products and technologies. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling array of products, services and solutions responsive to evolving customer innovations, preferences and specifications. We expect that increased use of water in industrial and commercial processes will drive increased customer demand in the future, and our ability to grow will depend in part on effectively responding to innovation in our customers' processes and systems. Further, our ability to provide products that comply with evolving government regulations will also be a driver of the appeal of our products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial customers.\nGovernment policies. Decaying water systems in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) will require critical drinking water and wastewater repairs, often led by municipal governments. Further, as U.S. states increase regulation on existing and emerging contaminants, we expect that our customers will increasingly require sustainable solutions to their water-related needs. In general, increased infrastructure investment and more stringent municipal, state and federal regulations promote increased spending on our products, services and solutions, while a slowdown in investment in public infrastructure or the elimination of key environmental regulations could result in lower industrial and municipal spending on water systems and products.\nAvailability of water. In general, we expect demand for our products and services to increase as the availability of clean water from public sources decreases. Secular trends that will drive demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. Because water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development, we expect that, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for our equipment and services will continue to increase.\nOperational investment. Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have made significant investments in our business that we believe have laid the foundation for continued profitable growth. Activities related to operational investments include employee training and development, integrating acquired businesses, implementing enhanced information systems, research, development and engineering investments and other activities to enable us to support our operating model.\nOur ability to source and distribute products effectively. Our revenues are affected by our ability to purchase our inputs in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our suppliers have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenues could be adversely affected in the event of constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our suppliers to produce sufficient quantities of raw materials in a manner that is able to match demand from our customers.\nContractual relationships with customers. Due to our large installed base and the nature of our contractual relationships with our customers, we have high visibility into a large portion of our revenue. The one- to twenty-year terms of many of our service contracts and the regular delivery and replacement of many of our products help to insulate us from the negative impact of any economic decline.\nExchange rates. The reporting currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the U.S. dollar. We operate in numerous countries around the world and therefore, certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, U.K. sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. While we believe we are not susceptible to any material impact on our results of operations caused by fluctuations in exchange rates because our operations are primarily conducted in the U.S., if we expand our foreign operations in the future, substantial increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as described more fully and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure below).\nRevenue\nOur sales are a function of sales volumes and selling prices, each of which is a function of the mix of product and service sales, and consist primarily of:\n \u2022 sales of tailored light industry technologies, heavy industry technologies and environmental products, services and solutions in collaboration with our industrial customers, backed by lifecycle services including emergency response services and outsourced water alternatives, to a broad group of industrial customers in our U.S., Canada and Singapore markets; \n \u2022 sales of products, services and solutions to engineering firms and municipalities to purify drinking water and treat wastewater globally; and \n \u2022 sales of a wide variety of differentiated products and technologies, to an array of OEM, distributor, end-user, engineering firm and integrator customers in all of our geographic markets and aftermarket channels.  Cost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is determined by subtracting cost of product sales and cost of services from our product and services revenue. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our combined product and services revenue.\nCost of product sales consists of all manufacturing costs required to bring a product to a ready for sale condition, including direct and indirect materials, direct and indirect labor costs including benefits, freight, depreciation, information technology, rental and insurance, repair and maintenance, utilities, other manufacturing costs, warranties and third party commissions.\nCost of services primarily consists of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technicians, depreciation of equipment and field service vehicles and freight costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist primarily of the following:\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses ( G&A expense\u201d) consist of fixed overhead personnel expenses associated with our corporate functions and our service organization (including district and branch managers, customer service, contract renewals and regeneration plant management). We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses ( S&M expense\u201d) consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products, services and solutions and related personnel expenses (including all Evoqua sales and application employees' base compensation and incentives), as well as sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, display expenses and related amortization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to actively promote our products, services and solutions.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses ( R&D expense\u201d) consist primarily of personnel expenses related to research and development, patents, sustaining engineering, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and overhead costs allocated to such expenses. Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nR&D expense can fluctuate depending on our determination to invest in developing new products, services and solutions and enhancing our existing products, services and solutions versus adding these capabilities through a mergers and acquisitions strategy. R&D expenditures are concentrated in our products businesses.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) is determined by subtracting operating expenses and interest expense from, and adding other operating income (expense), equity income from our partnership interest in Treated Water Outsourcing and income tax benefit (expense) to gross profit. For more information on how we determine gross profit, see Gross Profit.\u201d\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is one of the metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash share-based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains, losses and expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and provides greater clarity to management and our investors regarding the operational impact of long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\n \u2022 to assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance; \n \u2022 in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA; \n \u2022 in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA. \n \u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; \n \u2022 to make budgeting decisions; and \n \u2022 to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.  In addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable operating segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of the reportable operating segments does not include certain charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and share-based compensation charges.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\n\n (a) Restructuring and related business transformation costs  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We believe we are uniquely positioned to further penetrate our core markets, with over 200,000 installations across over 38,000 global customers. We maintain a customer-intimate business model with strong brand value and provide solutions-focused offerings capable of serving a customer's full lifecycle water treatment needs, both in current and new geographic regions.\nOur Service Model\nWe selectively target high value projects with opportunities for recurring business through service, parts and other aftermarket opportunities over the lifecycle of the process or capital equipment. In particular, we have developed internet-connected monitoring technologies through the deployment of our WaterOne\u00ae service platform, which enables customers to outsource their water treatment systems and focus on their core business, offering customers system optimization, predictive and proactive service, and simplified billing and pricing. Our WaterOne\u00ae platform also enables us to transition our customers to pricing models based on usage, which otherwise would not have been possible without technological advancement. Our technology solutions provide customers with increased stability and predictability in water-related costs, while enabling us to optimize our service route network and on demand offerings through predictive analytics, which we believe will result in market share gains, improved service levels, increased barriers to entry and reduced costs.\nProduct and Technology Development\nWe develop our technologies through in-house research, development and engineering and targeted tuck-in, vertical market and geography-expanding, technology-enhancing acquisitions. We have a reservoir of recently launched technologies and a strong pipeline of new offerings designed to provide customers with innovative, value-enhancing solutions. Furthermore, since April 2016, we have successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, strengthening our existing capabilities and adding new capabilities and cross selling opportunities in areas such as mobile wastewater treatment, soil and air treatment, regenerative media filtration, anodes, UV and ozone disinfection, aerobic and anaerobic biological treatment technologies and electrochemical and electrochlorination cells. We are able to rapidly scale new technologies using our leading direct and third-party sales channels and our relationships with key influencers, including municipal representatives, engineering firms, designers and other system specifiers. We believe our continued investment in driving penetration of our recently launched technologies, robust pipeline of new capabilities and best-in-class channels to market will allow us to continue to address our customer needs across the water lifecycle.\nOperational Excellence\nWe believe that continuous improvement of our operations, processes and organizational structure is a key driver of our earnings growth. We have identified and are pursuing several discrete initiatives that, if successful, we expect could result in additional cost savings over the next two years. These initiatives include our supply chain improvement program to consolidate and manage global spending, our improved logistics and transportation management program, capturing benefits of our WaterOne\u00ae platform and further optimizing our engineering cost structure, our global shared services organization and our sales, inventory and operations planning, including footprint rationalization. These improvements focus on creating value for customers through reduced leadtimes, improved quality and superior customer support, while also creating value for shareholders through enhanced earnings growth. Furthermore, as a result of significant investments we have made in our footprint and facilities, we believe we have the capacity to support our planned growth without commensurate increase in fixed costs.\nAcquisitions\nWe believe that capex-like, tuck-in acquisitions present a key opportunity within our overall growth strategy, which we will continue to evaluate strategically. These strategic acquisitions will enable us to accelerate our growth by extending the critical mass in existing markets as well as expand in new geographies and new end market verticals. Our existing customer relationships, best-in-class channels to market and ability to rapidly commercialize technologies provide a strong platform to drive rapid growth in the businesses we acquire. To capitalize on these opportunities, we have built an experienced team dedicated to mergers and acquisitions that has, since April 2016, successfully completed fourteen acquisitions and the acquisition of a 60% interest in Frontier Water Systems LLC, expanding our vertical markets and geographic reach and enhancing our technologies, with purchase prices ranging from approximately $2.0 million to approximately $283.7 million, and pre-acquisition revenues ranging from approximately $2.1 million to approximately $55.7 million.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2020, we acquired a 60% investment position in San Diego-based Frontier Water Systems, LLC ( Frontier\u201d), completed the sale of the Memcor product line to DuPont de Nemours, Inc. ( DuPont\u201d), and acquired the assets of privately held Aquapure Technologies ( Aquapure\u201d). The aggregate purchase price paid by DuPont for the Memcor product line was $110.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Following adjustments for cash and net working capital, gross proceeds paid by DuPont were $131.0 million. The Company recognized a $57.7 million net pre-tax benefit on the sale of the Memcor product line, net of $8.3 million of discretionary compensation payments to employees in connection with the transaction and $2.1 million in transaction costs incurred. The Company and DuPont have a history of collaboration, and following the sale, DuPont continues to supply the Company with Memcor products. During the year ended September 30, 2019, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of ATG UV Technology Limited ( ATG UV\u201d). See Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures,\u201d in Item 8 in this Annual Report for a complete discussion.\nWe will continue to actively evaluate acquisition opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy. We maintain a robust pipeline of potential acquisition targets, developed by our management team as well as various outside industry experts and consultants.\nKey Factors and Trends Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nVarious trends and other factors affect or have affected our operating results, including:\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business has been considered essential under federal and local standards, and we have maintained business continuity at our critical service branches and manufacturing facilities to date. We have taken measures to protect our employees, including implementation of remote working practices where possible and managing our supply chain to ensure that necessary personal protective equipment is available to our personnel. We have also taken certain cost reduction actions, some of which are temporary in nature, such as reduction of marketing travel activity as well as deferment of headcount additions to preserve liquidity and reallocated existing resources to maintain productivity levels where feasible.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on our business and how the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic might affect our customers' willingness to make capital expenditures and our ability to collect from our customers.\nFor more information regarding factors and events that may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-The COVID-19 pandemic and other future public health crises or pandemics could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nOverall economic trends. The overall economic environment and related changes in industrial, commercial and municipal spending impact our business. In general, positive conditions in the broader economy promote industrial, commercial and municipal customer spending, while economic weakness results in a reduction of new industrial, commercial and municipal project activity. Macroeconomic factors that can affect customer spending patterns, and thereby our results of operations, include population growth, total water consumption, municipal budgets, employment rates, business conditions, the availability of credit or capital, interest rates, tax rates, imposition of tariffs and regulatory changes. Since the businesses of our customers vary in cyclicality, periodic downturns in any specific sector typically have modest impacts on our overall business. For example, the recent weakness in global oil markets has created, and may continue to create, some weakness in demand from customers that we serve in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and may result in a sustained global recession.\nChanges in costs and availability. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, including steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate and iridium, and volatility in the market price and availability of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs and our business. For example, restrictions on international trade, including tariffs imposed by the U.S. government and other governments, as well as supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased and could further increase the cost of certain materials and have restricted and could further restrict availability of certain commodities, which may result in delays in our execution of projects. Although we have offset a portion of these\ncost increases through price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to recuperate additional cost increases from our customers through product price increases. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin. Further, additional potential acquisitions and international expansion will place increased demands on our operational, managerial, administrative and other resources. Managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our management systems, financial and management controls and information systems. We will also be required to hire, train and retain operational and sales personnel, which affects our operating margins.\nInflation and deflation trends. Our financial results can be expected to be directly impacted by substantial increases in costs due to commodity cost increases or general inflation which could lead to a reduction in our revenues as well as greater margin pressure as increased costs may not be able to be passed on to customers.\nFluctuation in quarterly results. Our quarterly results have historically varied depending upon a variety of factors, including funding, readiness of projects, regulatory approvals and significant weather events. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for industrial, commercial and municipal applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. As a result of these factors, our working capital requirements and demands on our distribution and delivery network may fluctuate during the year.\nNew products and technologies. Our ability to maintain our appeal to existing customers and attract new customers depends on our ability to originate, develop and offer a compelling array of products, services and solutions responsive to evolving customer innovations, preferences and specifications. We expect that increased use of water in industrial and commercial processes will drive increased customer demand in the future, and our ability to grow will depend in part on effectively responding to innovation in our customers' processes and systems. Further, our ability to provide products that comply with evolving government regulations will also be a driver of the appeal of our products, services and solutions to industrial and commercial customers.\nGovernment policies. Decaying water systems in the United States ( U.S.\u201d) will require critical drinking water and wastewater repairs, often led by municipal governments. Further, as U.S. states increase regulation on existing and emerging contaminants, we expect that our customers will increasingly require sustainable solutions to their water-related needs. In general, increased infrastructure investment and more stringent municipal, state and federal regulations promote increased spending on our products, services and solutions, while a slowdown in investment in public infrastructure or the elimination of key environmental regulations could result in lower industrial and municipal spending on water systems and products.\nAvailability of water. In general, we expect demand for our products and services to increase as the availability of clean water from public sources decreases. Secular trends that will drive demand for water across a multitude of industrial, commercial and municipal applications include global population growth, urbanization, industrialization and overall economic growth. In addition, the supply of clean water could be adversely impacted by factors including an aging water infrastructure within North America and increased levels of water stress from seasonal rainfall, inadequate water storage options or treatment technologies. Because water is a critical component and byproduct of many processes, including in manufacturing and product development, we expect that, as global consumption patterns evolve and water shortages persist, demand for our equipment and services will continue to increase.\nOperational investment. Our historical operating results reflect the impact of our ongoing investments to support our growth. We have made significant investments in our business that we believe have laid the foundation for continued profitable growth. Activities related to operational investments include employee training and development, integrating acquired businesses, implementing enhanced information systems, research, development and engineering investments and other activities to enable us to support our operating model.\nOur ability to source and distribute products effectively. Our revenues are affected by our ability to purchase our inputs in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. While we believe our suppliers have adequate capacity to meet our current and anticipated demand, our level of revenues could be adversely affected in the event of constraints in our supply chain, including the inability of our suppliers to produce sufficient quantities of raw materials in a manner that is able to match demand from our customers.\nContractual relationships with customers. Due to our large installed base and the nature of our contractual relationships with our customers, we have high visibility into a large portion of our revenue. The one- to twenty-year terms of many of our service contracts and the regular delivery and replacement of many of our products help to insulate us from the negative impact of any economic decline.\nExchange rates. The reporting currency for our Consolidated Financial Statements is the U.S. dollar. We operate in numerous countries around the world and therefore, certain of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are denominated in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily in the euro, U.K. sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Singapore dollar. To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate. As a result, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies will affect the amount of these items recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in the functional currency. While we believe we are not susceptible to any material impact on our results of operations caused by fluctuations in exchange rates because our operations are primarily conducted in the U.S., if we expand our foreign operations in the future, substantial increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to these other currencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nHow We Assess the Performance of Our Business\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key indicators of the financial condition and operating performance of our business are revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as described more fully and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure below).\nRevenue\nOur sales are a function of sales volumes and selling prices, each of which is a function of the mix of product and service sales, and consist primarily of:\n \u2022 sales of tailored light industry technologies, heavy industry technologies and environmental products, services and solutions in collaboration with our industrial customers, backed by lifecycle services including emergency response services and outsourced water alternatives, to a broad group of industrial customers in our U.S., Canada and Singapore markets; \n \u2022 sales of products, services and solutions to engineering firms and municipalities to purify drinking water and treat wastewater globally; and \n \u2022 sales of a wide variety of differentiated products and technologies, to an array of OEM, distributor, end-user, engineering firm and integrator customers in all of our geographic markets and aftermarket channels.  Cost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is determined by subtracting cost of product sales and cost of services from our product and services revenue. Gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our combined product and services revenue.\nCost of product sales consists of all manufacturing costs required to bring a product to a ready for sale condition, including direct and indirect materials, direct and indirect labor costs including benefits, freight, depreciation, information technology, rental and insurance, repair and maintenance, utilities, other manufacturing costs, warranties and third party commissions.\nCost of services primarily consists of the cost of personnel and travel for our field service, supply chain and technicians, depreciation of equipment and field service vehicles and freight costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist primarily of the following:\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses ( G&A expense\u201d) consist of fixed overhead personnel expenses associated with our corporate functions and our service organization (including district and branch managers, customer service, contract renewals and regeneration plant management). We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase due to the anticipated growth of our business and related infrastructure as well as legal, accounting, insurance, investor relations and other costs associated with being a public company.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses ( S&M expense\u201d) consist primarily of advertising and marketing promotions of our products, services and solutions and related personnel expenses (including all Evoqua sales and application employees' base compensation and incentives), as well as sponsorship costs, consulting and contractor expenses, travel, display expenses and related amortization. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we continue to actively promote our products, services and solutions.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses ( R&D expense\u201d) consist primarily of personnel expenses related to research and development, patents, sustaining engineering, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials and overhead costs allocated to such expenses. Substantially all of our research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving our existing products and services. To date, research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred, because the period between achieving technological feasibility and the release of products and services for sale has been short and development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant.\nR&D expense can fluctuate depending on our determination to invest in developing new products, services and solutions and enhancing our existing products, services and solutions versus adding these capabilities through a mergers and acquisitions strategy. R&D expenditures are concentrated in our products businesses.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet income (loss) is determined by subtracting operating expenses and interest expense from, and adding other operating income (expense), equity income from our partnership interest in Treated Water Outsourcing and income tax benefit (expense) to gross profit. For more information on how we determine gross profit, see Gross Profit.\u201d\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is one of the metrics used by management to evaluate the financial performance of our business. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax benefit (expense) and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the impact of certain other items, including restructuring and related business transformation costs, purchase accounting adjustment costs, non-cash share-based compensation, sponsor fees, transaction costs and other gains, losses and expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA, which is not a recognized financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), because we believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Further, we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and provides greater clarity to management and our investors regarding the operational impact of long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance as follows:\n \u2022 to assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance; \n \u2022 in our management incentive compensation which is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA; \n \u2022 in certain calculations under our senior secured credit facilities, which use components of Adjusted EBITDA. \n \u2022 to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; \n \u2022 to make budgeting decisions; and \n \u2022 to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.  In addition to the above, our chief operating decision maker uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of each reportable operating segment to evaluate the operating performance of such segments. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of the reportable operating segments does not include certain charges that are presented within Corporate activities. These charges include certain restructuring and other business transformation charges that have been incurred to align and reposition the Company to the current reporting structure, acquisition related costs (including transaction costs, integration costs and recognition of backlog intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting) and share-based compensation charges.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future, we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our Net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>107.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>275.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and related business transformation costs (a)\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation (b)\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs (c)\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sponsor fees (d)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (gains) losses and expenses (e)\n</td> <td>(65.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>239.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Restructuring and related business transformation costs  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated"}
