MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The historical consolidated financial data discussed below reflects the historical results and financial position of KREF. In addition, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described under Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nIntroduction\nKKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. is a real estate finance company that focuses primarily on originating and acquiring senior loans secured by CRE assets. We are externally managed by KKR Real Estate Finance Manager LLC, an indirect subsidiary of KKR, and are a REIT traded on the NYSE under the symbol KREF.\u201d We are headquartered in New York City.\nWe conduct our operations as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that permits us to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act. We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various subsidiaries.\n2017 Highlights\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed our IPO of 11.8 million shares of common stock, raising net proceeds of $225.9 million bringing our book value to $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, a 113% increase over 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders of $58.8 million, or $1.30 per basic and diluted share of common stock and Net Core Earnings of $55.5 million, or $1.22 per diluted share of common stock increased 89% and 100%, respectively, compared to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Current portfolio of $2,083.1 million is 100% performing and 93% floating-rate with a weighted average LTV of 67% as of December 31, 2017.

Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings are measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Core Earnings as net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders or, without duplication, owners of our subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the incentive compensation payable to our Manager, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and (v) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items after discussions between our Manager and our board of directors (and subject to the approval by a majority of our independent directors). The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. Net Core Earnings is Core Earnings less incentive compensation payable to our Manager.\nWe believe providing Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of our business. Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP net income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs.\nWe also use Core Earnings to determine the management and incentive fees we pay our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders to Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation to affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gains) or losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation to affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Core Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,685,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,320,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,299,597\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,688,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,321,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,299,597\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings per Diluted Weighted Average Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Core Earnings per Diluted Weighted Average Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Excludes $1.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted weighted average share outstanding, of net original issue discount on CMBS B-Pieces accreted as a component of taxable income during the three months ended December 31, 2017.

As we continue to scale our portfolio, we expect that our originations will be heavily weighted toward floating-rate loans. We expect the majority of our future investment activity to focus on originating floating-rate senior loans that we finance with our repurchase facilities, with a secondary focus on originated floating-rate loans for which we syndicate a senior position and retain a subordinated interest for our portfolio. As a result, we expect that the percentage of our target portfolio comprised of CMBS B-Pieces will decrease over time and the percentage of floating-rate investments, including senior loans, will increase over time. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio had experienced no impairments and did not contain any legacy assets that were originated prior to October 2014. As of December 31, 2017, all of our investments were located in the United States. The following charts illustrate the diversification of our portfolio, based on type of investment, interest rate, underlying property type and geographic location, as of December 31, 2017:\nThe charts above are based on total assets. Total assets reflect (i) the principal amount of our senior and mezzanine loans; and (ii) the cost basis of our CMBS B-Pieces, net of VIE liabilities. In accordance with GAAP, we carry our CMBS B-Pieces at fair value, which we valued above our cost basis as of December 31, 2017.\n(A) Excludes CMBS B-Pieces.

Our loan documents generally give us the right to receive regular property, borrower and guarantor financial statements; approve annual budgets and tenant leases; and enforce loan covenants and remedies. In addition, our Manager evaluates the macroeconomic environment, prevailing real estate fundamentals and micro-market dynamics where the underlying property is located. Through site inspections, local market experts and various data sources, as part of its risk assessment, our Manager monitors criteria such as new supply and tenant demand, market occupancy and rental rate trends, and capitalization rates and valuation trends.\nIn addition to ongoing asset management, our Manager performs a quarterly review of our portfolio whereby each loan is assigned a risk rating of 1 through 5, from lowest risk to highest risk. Our Manager is responsible for reviewing, assigning and updating the risk ratings for each loan on a quarterly basis. The risk ratings are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, underlying real estate performance and asset value, values of comparable properties, durability and quality of property cash flows, sponsor experience and financial wherewithal, and the existence of a risk-mitigating loan structure. Additional key considerations include LTVs, debt service coverage ratios, real estate and credit market dynamics, and risk of default or principal loss. Based on a five-point scale, our loans are rated \"1\" through \"5,\" from less risk to greater risk, which ratings are defined as follows:\n1-Very Low Risk-The underlying property performance has surpassed underwritten expectations, and the sponsor's business plan is generally complete. The property demonstrates stabilized occupancy and/or rental rates resulting in strong current cash flow and/or a very low LTV (<65%). At the level of performance, it is very likely that the underlying loan can be refinanced easily in the period's prevailing capital market conditions.\n2-Low Risk-The underlying property performance has matched or exceeded underwritten expectations, and the sponsor's business plan may be ahead of schedule or has achieved some or many of the major milestones from a risk mitigation perspective. The property has achieved improving occupancy at market rents, resulting in sufficient current cash flow and/or a low LTV (65%-70%). Operating trends are favorable, and the underlying loan can be refinanced in today's prevailing capital market conditions. The sponsor/manager is well capitalized or has demonstrated a history of success in owning or operating similar real estate.\n3-Average Risk-The underlying property performance is in-line with underwritten expectations, or the sponsor may be in the early stages of executing its business plan. Current cash flow supports debt service payments, or there is an ample interest reserve or loan structure in place to provide the sponsor time to execute the value-improvement plan. The property exhibits a moderate LTV (<75%). Loan structure appropriately mitigates additional risks. The sponsor/manager has a stable credit history and experience owning or operating similar real estate.\n4-High Risk/Potential for Loss: A loan that has a risk of realizing a principal loss. The underlying property performance is behind underwritten expectations, or the sponsor is behind schedule in executing its business plan. The underlying market fundamentals may have deteriorated, comparable property valuations may be declining or property occupancy has been volatile, resulting in current cash flow that may not support debt service payments. The loan exhibits a high LTV (>80%), and the loan covenants are unlikely to fully mitigate some risks. Interest payments may come from an interest reserve or sponsor equity.\n5-Impaired/Loss Likely: A loan that has a very high risk of realizing a principal loss or has otherwise incurred a principal loss. The underlying property performance is significantly behind underwritten expectations, the sponsor has failed to execute its business plan and/or the sponsor has missed interest payments. The market fundamentals have deteriorated, or property performance has unexpectedly declined or valuations for comparable properties have declined meaningfully since loan origination. Current cash flow does not support debt service payments. With the current capital structure, the sponsor might not be incentivized to protect its equity without a restructuring of the loan.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, no investments were rated 5 (Impaired/Loss Likely).\nCMBS B-Piece Investments\nOur Manager has processes and procedures in place to monitor and assess the credit quality of our CMBS B-Piece investments and promote the regular and active management of these investments. This includes reviewing the performance of the real estate assets underlying the loans that collateralize the investments and determining the impact of such performance on the credit and return profile of the investments. Our Manager holds monthly surveillance calls with the special servicer of our CMBS B-Piece investments to monitor the performance of our portfolio and discuss issues associated with the loans underlying our CMBS B-Piece investments. At each meeting, our Manager is provided with a due diligence submission for each loan underlying our CMBS B-Piece investments, which includes both property- and loan-level information. These meetings assist our Manager in monitoring our portfolio, identifying any potential loan issues, determining if a re-underwriting of any loan is warranted and examining the timing and severity of any potential losses or impairments.\nIn addition to monthly surveillance, our Manager is involved in major decision approval requests by borrowers relating to the loans that collateralize our CMBS B-Piece investments. Our Manager engages a third-party special servicer to administer each request, which in turn presents each request to our Manager for review and approval. This process helps our Manager anticipate potential loan issues and proactively formulate responses as it relates to each loan approval request. As part of this process, our Manager receives updated financial information, rent rolls and performance metrics for each loan, which allows our Manager to regularly assess the performance of our loan collateral. In addition to monitoring loans that collateralize our CMBS B-Piece investments, our Manager also actively monitors watch list loans, loans that have been transferred into special servicing, and loan defaults in the CMBS B-Piece market generally, which helps our Manager anticipate potential market- and/or asset-specific issues that may affect our portfolio.\nValuations for our CMBS B-Piece investments are prepared using inputs from an independent valuation firm and confirmed by our Manager via quotes from two or more broker-dealers that actively make markets in CMBS. As part of the quarterly valuation process, our Manager also reviews pricing indications for comparable CMBS and monitors the credit metrics of the loans that collateralize our CMBS B-Piece investments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, there were no delinquencies greater than 60 days associated with any loans underlying our CMBS B-Piece investments.\nSecured Financing Agreements\nThe following table details our secured financing agreements (dollars in thousands):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Collateral\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Secured Financing Borrowings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lender\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility Size(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Assets(B)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Potential(C)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Available\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>750,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>686,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>499,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Morgan Stanley(D)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>600,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>676,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goldman Sachs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,825,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,443,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,109,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140,555\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Maximum facility size represents the largest amount of borrowings available under a given facility once sufficient collateral assets have been approved by the lender and pledged by us.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>Represents the principal balance of the collateral assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(C)\n</td> <td>Potential borrowings represents the total amount we could draw under each facility based on collateral already approved and pledged.

capital deployed in investments as we continued to scale our portfolio, based on the interest income earned on our loan portfolio that had a weighted-average principal balance of $1.2 billion and $0.5 billion, partially offset by the interest expense on our secured financing arrangement we used to finance those investments that had an average daily amount outstanding of $0.6 billion and $0.2 billion, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income includes $3.6 million and $1.0 million in amortization of net deferred loan fees and origination discounts during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, loan and preferred interest repayments of $70.9 million partially offset the increase in interest income by $3.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet interest income increased $13.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributed to increased interest income in connection with increased investments made with capital raised from the private placements of our common stock as we continued to scale our portfolio, partially offset by increased interest expense resulting from interest on amounts outstanding under our repurchase facilities used to finance investments in senior loans. The partial offset to interest income is inclusive of $1.0 million and $0.2 million of accretion of net deferred loan fees and origination discounts during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOther Income\nTotal other income increased $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to a $0.9 million increase in income from equity method investments in which we entered during the year ended December 31, 2017, a $0.7 million increase in other income, and a $0.4 million increase from income on our purchase of a CMBS B-Piece during the year ended December 31, 2016. We realized a $0.3 million gain on the\nsale of an investment during the year ended December 31, 2016, but did not realize a gain or loss on the sale of investments in the year ended December 31, 2017, which partially offset the increase in other income.\nTotal other income increased $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributed to increased income earned on our investments in CMBS B-Pieces resulting from an increased amount of CMBS B-Piece investments, partially offset by smaller realized gains during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased $9.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily attributed to increased management fees of $7.6 million, resulting from an increase in our equity from the private placement of our common stock and our IPO, as well as an additional $2.7 million of general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily consisting of legal, audit, insurance, information technology, and other increased costs as we scaled our portfolio and became a public company. This increase was partially offset by decreased incentive compensation expense payable to our Manager resulting from the time required to invest our proceeds received from equity issuances.\nTotal operating expenses increased $3.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily attributed to increased management fees resulting from an increase in our equity from the private placements of our common stock and increased incentive compensation resulting from increased Core Earnings.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur primary liquidity needs include: our ongoing commitments to repay the principal of and interest on our borrowings and pay other financing costs; financing our assets; meeting future funding obligations; making distributions to our stockholders; funding our operations, which includes making payments to our Manager in accordance with the management agreement; and satisfying other general business needs.\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources through December 31, 2017 have been derived from: $1,060.9 million in net proceeds from equity issuances; $969.3 million in net advances from our repurchase facilities; $152.4 million in proceeds from syndicated financing; and cash flows from operations. We may seek additional sources of liquidity from repurchase facilities, syndicated financing, other borrowings (including borrowings not related to a specific investment) and future offerings of equity and debt securities. In addition, we may apply our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations to any liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $103.1 million.\nDebt-to-Equity Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio\nThe following table presents our debt-to-equity ratio and total leverage ratio:\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total leverage ratio(B)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Represents (i) total outstanding secured debt agreements less cash to (ii) total stockholders' equity, in each case, at period end.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>Represents (i) total outstanding secured debt agreements, loan participations sold, non-consolidated senior interests, less cash to (ii) total stockholders' equity, in each case, at period end.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our secured financing agreements.

After a mortgage asset is identified by us, the lender agrees to advance a certain percentage of the face value of the mortgage to us in exchange for a secured interest in the mortgage.\nRepurchase agreements effectively allow us to borrow against loans, participations and securities that we own in an amount generally equal to (i) the market value of such loans, participations and/or securities multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. Under these agreements, we sell our loans, participations and securities to a counterparty and agree to repurchase the same loans and securities from the counterparty at a price equal to the original sales price plus an interest factor. The transaction is treated as a secured loan from the financial institution for GAAP purposes. During the term of a repurchase agreement, we receive the principal and interest on the related loans, participations and securities and pay interest to the lender under the master repurchase agreement. At any point in time, the amounts and the cost of our repurchase borrowings will be based upon the assets being financed-higher risk assets will result in lower advance rates (i.e., levels of leverage) at higher borrowing costs and vice versa. In addition, these facilities include various financial covenants and limited recourse guarantees, including those described below.\nEach of our existing master repurchase facilities includes \"credit mark\" features. \"Credit mark\" provisions in repurchase facilities are designed to keep the lenders' credit exposure constant as a percentage of the underlying collateral value of the assets pledged as security to them. If the underlying collateral value decreases, the gross amount of leverage available to us will be reduced as our assets are marked to market, which would reduce our liquidity. The lender under the applicable repurchase facility sets the valuation and any revaluation of the collateral assets in its sole, good faith discretion. As a contractual matter, the lender has the right to reset the value of the assets at any time based on then-current market conditions, but the market convention is to reassess valuations on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis using the financial information delivered pursuant to the facility documentation regarding the real property, borrower and guarantor under such underlying loans. Generally, if the lender determines (subject to certain conditions) that the market value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a defined minimum amount, the lender may require us to provide additional collateral or lead to margin calls that may require us to repay all or a portion of the funds advanced. We closely monitor our liquidity and intend to maintain sufficient liquidity on our balance sheet in order to meet any margin calls in the event of any significant decreases in asset values. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the weighted average haircut under our repurchase agreements was 32.9% and 28.8%, respectively (or 27.3% and 25.9%, respectively, if we had borrowed the maximum amount approved by its repurchase agreement counterparties as of such dates). In addition, our existing master repurchase facilities are not entirely term-matched financings and may mature before our CRE debt investments that represent underlying collateral to those financings. As we negotiate renewals and extensions of these liabilities, we may experience lower advance rates and higher pricing under the renewed or extended agreements.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nWe may also use our secured revolving credit facility as a source of financing, which is designed to provide short term liquidity to purchase loans or other eligible assets, pay operating expenses, and borrow amounts for general corporate purposes. Any amounts borrowed are full recourse to us. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of (i) a floating rate index and (ii) a fixed margin.\nBorrowing Activities\nThe following tables provide additional information regarding our borrowings (dollars in thousands): Table 203: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Outstanding Face Amount at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Daily Amount Outstanding(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Maximum Amount Outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted Average Daily Interest Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>353,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Morgan Stanley\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>202,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>423,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goldman Sachs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total/Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,347\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>563,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) Represents the average for the period the debt was outstanding.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average Daily Amount Outstanding(A)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wells Fargo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>485,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>287,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Morgan Stanley\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,883\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,743\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>JPMorgan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goldman Sachs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Barclays\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n.a.\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(A) Represents the average for the period the debt was outstanding.\nCovenants-Each of our repurchase facilities contains customary terms and conditions for repurchase facilities of this type, including, but not limited to, negative covenants relating to restrictions on our operations with respect to our status as a REIT, and financial covenants, such as:\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an interest income to interest expense ratio covenant (1.5 to 1.0);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a minimum consolidated tangible net worth covenant (75.0% of the aggregate net cash proceeds of any equity issuances made and any capital contributions received by us and KKR Real Estate Finance Holdings L.P.

The borrower in each case is a special purpose subsidiary of the Company. With respect to our secured revolving credit facility, the amounts borrowed are full recourse to us.\nCMBS-related Liabilities\nIn connection with our investments in CMBS B-Pieces, we consolidate the trust entities, called VIEs, that hold the pools of senior loans underlying the CMBS because we are considered the primary beneficiary of such entities. As a result of this consolidation, our financial statements include the liabilities of these VIEs. However, these liabilities are not recourse to us, and our risk of loss is limited to the value of our investment in the related CMBS B-Piece. See the table under \"Consolidated Debt Obligations\" above for a summary of these liabilities as of December 31, 2017.\nLoan Participations Sold\nIn connection with our investments in senior loans, we finance certain investments through the syndication of a non-recourse, or limited-recourse, loan participation to an unaffiliated third party. Our presentation of the senior loan and related financing involved in the syndication depends upon whether GAAP recognized the transaction as a sale, though such differences in presentation do not generally impact our net stockholders' equity or net income aside from timing differences in the recognition of certain transaction costs.\nTo the extent that GAAP recognizes a sale resulting from the syndication, we derecognize the participation in the senior loan that we sold and continue to carry the retained portion of the loan as an investment. While we do not generally expect to recognize a material gain or loss on these sales, we would realize a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the net proceeds received from the third party purchaser and our carrying value of the loan participation we sold at time of sale. Furthermore, we recognize interest income only on the portion of the senior loan that we retain as a result of the sale.\nTo the extent that GAAP does not recognize a sale resulting from the syndication, we do not derecognize the participation in the senior loan that we sold. Instead, we recognize a loan participation sold liability in an amount equal to the principal of the loan participation syndicated less any unamortized discounts or financing costs resulting from the syndication. We continue to recognize interest income on the entire senior loan, including the interest attributable to the loan participation sold, as well as interest expense on the loan participation sold liability.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows From Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows From Investing Activities\n</td> <td>(1,083,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(456,448\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(364,307\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows From Financing Activities\n</td> <td>1,037,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,602\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>379,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities were primarily driven by our net interest income, which is driven by the income generated by our investments less financing costs, and activities related to our commercial mortgage loans held-for-sale.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we funded or purchased $308.0 million, $150.8 million, and $23.9 million of senior and mezzanine loans, CMBS and preferred equity interests, respectively, and received $13.3 million of principal repayments on certain mezzanine loans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we also received proceeds of $83.8 million and $21.6 million from the sale of CMBS and a mezzanine loan, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows from financing activities were primarily driven by the issuance of our common stock for net proceeds of $581.3 million, $210.0 million, and $256.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Our taxable income does not necessarily equal our net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP, or our Core Earnings as described above under \" - Key Financial Measures and Indicators - Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings.\"\nSubsequent Events\nThe following events occurred subsequent to December 31, 2017:\nInvesting Activities\nWe originated the following senior loan subsequent to December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description/ Location\n</td> <td>Property Type\n</td> <td>Month Originated\n</td> <td>Maximum Face Amount\n</td> <td>Initial Face Amount Funded\n</td> <td>Interest Rate(A)\n</td> <td>Maturity Date(B)\n</td> <td>LTV\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>St. Paul, Minnesota\n</td> <td>Office\n</td> <td>January 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>L + 3.6%\n</td> <td>February 2023\n</td> <td>73%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(A)\n</td> <td>Floating rate based on one-month USD LIBOR.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(B)\n</td> <td>Maturity date assumes all extension options are exercised, if applicable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunding of Previously Closed Loans\nBetween January 1, 2018 and February 23, 2018, we funded approximately $19.1 million for previously closed loans subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nLoan Repayments\nIn February 2018, we received approximately $33.3 million from loan repayments, which represents our 95% interest in a $35.0 million mezzanine loan.\nFunding of Capital Commitments\nIn February 2018, we funded $4.0 million related to our investment in RECOP.\nFinancing Activities\nIn February 2018, we borrowed $4.0 million in proceeds under the Morgan Stanley master repurchase facility.\nCorporate Activities\nDividends\nIn January 2018, we paid a $19.9 million dividend on our common and special voting preferred stock, or $0.37 per share, with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017, to stockholders of record on December 29, 2017.\nShare Buyback\nBetween January 1, 2018 and February 23, 2018, we repurchased 496,809 shares of our common stock for $9.7 million at a weighted average price per share of $19.49.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs described in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, we have off-balance sheet arrangements related to VIEs that we account for using the equity method of accounting and in which we hold an economic interest or have a capital commitment. Our maximum risk of loss associated with our interests in VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity and any unfunded capital commitments. As of December 31, 2017, we held $14.4 million of interests in such entities, which does not include a remaining commitment of $26.0 million to RECOP that we are required to fund when called. See \"-Subsequent Events\" for RECOP capital call subsequent to December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties. Accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties that could affect our reported assets and liabilities, as well as our reported revenue and expenses. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. If conditions change from those expected, it is possible that the judgments and estimates described below could change, which may result in a change in our interest income recognition, allowance for loan losses, tax liability, future impairment of our investments, and valuation of our investment portfolio, among other effects. We believe that the following accounting policies are among the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments:\nInterest Income Recognition\nIn estimating interest income, we make a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies, including interest rate and timing of principal payments. Loans where we expect to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are considered performing loans. We accrue interest income on performing loans based on the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of the loan. Interest income also includes origination discount and direct loan origination costs for loans that we originate, but where we did not elect the fair value option, as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method over the loan term. We expense origination discount and direct loan origination costs for loans acquired but not originated by us, as well as loans for which we elected the fair value option, as incurred. We also include income, including the amortization of premiums and discounts, arising from our preferred interests in joint ventures held-to-maturity.\nWe consider loans to be past due when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 60 days or more. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status and considered non-performing when full payment of principal and interest is in doubt, which generally occurs when principal or interest is 120 days or more past due unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. We may return a loan to accrual status when repayment of principal and interest is reasonably assured under the terms of the restructured loan. We did not hold any loans that we placed on nonaccrual status or otherwise considered past due during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that we have operated in a manner qualifying us as a REIT since our election and intend to continue to so operate. Accordingly, we do not believe we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our net taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders as long as certain asset, income and share ownership tests are met.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. We may also be subject to state or local income or franchise taxes as we consolidate subsidiaries that incur state and local income taxes, based on the tax jurisdiction in which each subsidiary operates.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any material deferred tax assets or liabilities arising from future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in accordance with GAAP and their respective tax bases. In addition, we recognize tax benefits for uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included as a component of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not have any material uncertain tax positions.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nWe originate and purchase CRE debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments at amortized cost. We perform a quarterly evaluation of loans classified as held-for-investment for impairment on a loan-by-loan basis. If we deem that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts owed according to the contractual terms of a loan, impairment of that loan is indicated. If we consider a loan to be impaired, we establish an allowance for loan losses, through a valuation provision in earnings that reduces carrying value of the loan to the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's contractual effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Significant\njudgment is required in determining impairment and in estimating the resulting loss allowance, and actual losses, if any, could materially differ from those estimates.\nWe perform a quarterly review of our portfolio. In conjunction with this review, we assess the risk factors of each loan, including, without limitation, LTV, debt yield, property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, cash flow volatility, leasing and tenant profile, loan structure and exit plan, and project sponsorship.\nFair Value\nGeneral - GAAP requires the categorization of the fair value of financial instruments into three broad levels that form a hierarchy based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation.\nLevel 1 - Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.\nWe follow this hierarchy for our financial instruments. The classifications are based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nValuation Process - Our Manager reviews the valuation of Level 3 financial instruments as part of our quarterly process. Our Manager's valuation process for Level 3 measurements, as described below, is subject to the review and oversight of various KKR committees. KKR has a global valuation committee assisted by the asset class-specific valuation committees, including a real estate valuation committee that reviews and approves all preliminary Level 3 valuations for real estate assets including the financial instruments held by us. KKR's global valuation committee is responsible for coordinating and implementing KKR's valuation process to ensure consistency in the application of valuation principles across portfolio investments and between periods. All Level 3 valuations are also subject to approval by KKR's global valuation committee.\nValuation of Consolidated VIEs - We have elected the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities of each CMBS trust that we consolidate, and we have adopted the measurement alternative included in Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-13, Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity (\"ASU 2014-13\"). Pursuant to ASU 2014-13, we measure both the financial assets and financial liabilities of the CMBS trusts we consolidate using the fair value of the financial liabilities, which we consider more observable than the fair value of the financial assets. As a result, we present the CMBS issued by the consolidated trust, but not beneficially owned by our stockholders, as financial liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, measured at their estimated fair value; we measure the financial assets as the total estimated fair value of the CMBS issued by the consolidated trust, regardless of whether such CMBS represent interests beneficially owned by our stockholders. Under the measurement alternative prescribed by ASU 2014-13, our \"Net income (loss)\" reflects the economic interests in the consolidated CMBS beneficially owned by our stockholders, presented as \"Change in net assets related to consolidated variable interest entities\" in our consolidated statements of income, which includes applicable (i) changes in the fair value of CMBS beneficially owned by us, (ii) interest and servicing fees earned from the CMBS trust and (iii) other residual returns or losses of the CMBS trust, if any.\nOther Valuation Matters - For Level 3 financial assets originated, or otherwise acquired, and financial liabilities assumed during the calendar month immediately preceding a quarter end that were conducted in an orderly transaction with an unrelated party, we generally believe that the transaction price provides the most observable indication of fair value given the illiquid nature of these financial instruments, unless we are aware of any circumstances that may cause a material change in the fair value through the remainder of the reporting period. For instance, significant changes to the underlying property or its planned operations may cause material changes in the fair value of senior loans acquired, or originated, by us.\nOur determination of fair value is based upon the best information available for a given circumstance and may incorporate assumptions that are our best estimates after consideration of a variety of internal and external factors. When an independent valuation firm expresses an opinion on the fair value of a financial instrument in the form of a range, we select a value within the range provided by the independent valuation firm, generally the midpoint, to assess the reasonableness of our estimated fair value for that financial instrument.\nValuation Methodologies\nCommercial Mortgage Loans - We generally consider our senior loans and mezzanine loans as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy as such assets are illiquid, structured investments that are specific to the property and its operating performance. These loans are valued using a discounted cash flow model using discount rates derived from observable market data applied to the capital structure of the respective sponsor and estimated property value. On a quarterly basis, we engage an independent valuation firm to express an opinion on the fair value of each loan categorized as a Level 3 asset in the form of a range based upon the unpaid principal balance of the loan. We select a value within the range provided by the independent valuation firm, generally the midpoint, to assess the reasonableness of the fair value as determined by us. In the event that our estimate of fair value differs from the opinion of fair value provided by the independent valuation firm, we ultimately rely solely upon the valuation prepared by the investment personnel of our Manager.\nPreferred Equity Investments - We categorize our preferred equity investments as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy. Preferred equity investments are valued using a discounted cash flow model using discount rates derived from observable market data applied to the internal rate of return implied by the expected contractual cash flows. On a quarterly basis, we engage an independent valuation firm to express an opinion on the fair value of our preferred equity investments in the form of a range based upon the unpaid principal balance of the security. We select a value within the range provided by the independent valuation firm, generally the midpoint, to assess the reasonableness of the fair value, as determined by us, of the security. In the event that our estimate of fair value differs from the opinion of fair value provided by the independent valuation firm, we ultimately rely solely upon the valuation prepared by the investment personnel of our Manager.\nCMBS - We categorize our CMBS investments as Level 3 assets and liabilities in the fair value hierarchy and obtain prices from an independent valuation firm, which uses a discounted cash flow model, to value each CMBS. The key input is the expected yield of each CMBS using both observable and unobservable factors, which may include recently offered or completed trades and published yields of similar securities, security-specific characteristics (e.g., security ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, credit support by other subordinate securities issued by the CMBS and coupon type), performance of the underlying collateral (e.g., delinquency, loan losses) and other relevant characteristics.\nWe perform quarterly reviews of the inputs received from the independent valuation firm based on consideration given to a number of observable market data points including, but not limited to, trading activity in the marketplace of like-kind securities, benchmark security evaluations and bid list results from various sources. If prices received from the independent valuation firm are inconsistent with values determined in connection with our independent review, we will make inquiries to the independent valuation firm about the prices received and related methods. In the event we determine the price obtained from an independent valuation firm to be unreliable or an inadequate representation of the fair value of the CMBS (based on consideration given to the observable market data points detailed above), we will then compile evidence independently and present the independent valuation firm with such evidence supporting a different value. As a result, the independent valuation firm may revise their price. However, if we continue to disagree with the price from the independent valuation firm, in light of evidence presented that we compiled independently and believe to be compelling, we will consider the quotation unreliable or an inadequate representation of the fair value of the CMBS.\nIn the event that the quotation from the independent valuation firm is not available or determined to be unreliable or an inadequate representation of the fair value of the CMBS (based on the procedures detailed above), valuations are prepared using inputs based on non-binding broker quotes obtained from independent, well-known, major financial brokers that make markets in CMBS. In validating any non-binding broker quote used in this circumstance, management compares the non-binding quote to the observable market data points at such time and used to validate prices received from the independent valuation firm in addition to understanding the valuation methodologies used by the market makers. These market participants utilize a similar methodology as the independent valuation firm to value each CMBS, with the key input of expected yield determined independently based on both observable and unobservable factors (as described above). To avoid reliance on any single broker-dealer, we receive a minimum of two non-binding quotes, of which the average is used.\nThe fair values of the CMBS not beneficially owned by our stockholders do not impact our net assets or the net income attributable to our stockholders.\nRepurchase Facilities - We generally consider our repurchase facilities Level 3 liabilities in the fair value hierarchy as such liabilities represent borrowings on illiquid collateral with terms specific to each borrower. Given the short to moderate term of the floating-rate facilities, we generally expect the fair value of our repurchase facilities to approximate their outstanding principal balances. On a quarterly basis, we engage an independent valuation firm to express an opinion on the fair value of our repurchase facilities using a market-based methodology to assess the reasonableness of the fair value, as determined by us, of the repurchase facility.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis - Certain assets not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment, are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For senior loans held-for-sale, we apply the lower of cost or fair value accounting and may be required, from time to time, to record a nonrecurring fair value adjustment. For senior loans held-for-investment and preferred interests in joint ventures held-to-maturity, we apply the amortized cost method of accounting, but may be required, from time to time, to record a nonrecurring fair value adjustment in the form of a valuation provision or impairment. We did not report any financial assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAssets and Liabilities for Which Fair Value is Only Disclosed - We do not carry our repurchase facilities at fair value as we do not elect the fair value option for these liabilities. As of the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the fair value of our floating-rate repurchase facilities approximated the outstanding principal balances.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations as of December 31, 2017.

Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings are measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Core Earnings as net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders or, without duplication, owners of our subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the incentive compensation payable to our Manager, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and (v) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items after discussions between our Manager and our board of directors (and subject to the approval by a majority of our independent directors). The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. Net Core Earnings is Core Earnings less incentive compensation payable to our Manager.\nWe believe providing Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of our business. Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP net income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs.\nWe also use Core Earnings to determine the management and incentive fees we pay our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders to Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\n (A) Excludes $1.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted weighted average share outstanding, of net original issue discount on CMBS B-Pieces accreted as a component of taxable income during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Excludes $4.0 million and $3.4 million, or $0.09 and $0.17 per diluted weighted average share outstanding of net original issue discount on CMBS B-Pieces accreted as a component of taxable income during the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. \nBook Value per Share\nWe believe that book value per share is helpful to stockholders in evaluating the growth of our company as we have scaled our equity capital base and continue to invest in our target assets. The following table calculates our book value per share of common stock (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data):\n\nOur Portfolio\nWe have established a portfolio of diversified investments, consisting of performing senior loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity and CMBS B-Pieces, which had a value of $2,083.1 million as of December 31, 2017. As we continue to scale our portfolio, we expect that our originations will be heavily weighted toward floating-rate loans. We expect the majority of our future investment activity to focus on originating floating-rate senior loans that we finance with our repurchase facilities, with a secondary focus on originated floating-rate loans for which we syndicate a senior position and retain a subordinated interest for our portfolio. As a result, we expect that the percentage of our target portfolio comprised of CMBS B-Pieces will decrease over time and the percentage of floating-rate investments, including senior loans, will increase over time. As of December 31, 2017, our portfolio had experienced no impairments and did not contain any legacy assets that were originated prior to October 2014. As of December 31, 2017, all of our investments were located in the United States. The following charts illustrate the diversification of our portfolio, based on type of investment, interest rate, underlying property type and geographic location, as of December 31, 2017:\nThe charts above are based on total assets. Total assets reflect (i) the principal amount of our senior and mezzanine loans; and (ii) the cost basis of our CMBS B-Pieces, net of VIE liabilities. In accordance with GAAP, we carry our CMBS B-Pieces at fair value, which we valued above our cost basis as of December 31, 2017.\n(A) Excludes CMBS B-Pieces. Our CMBS B-Piece portfolio diversification is as follows and is inclusive of our $14.0 million investment in RECOP:\n \u2022 Property Type: Office (26.7%), Retail (24.9%), Hospitality (15.2%), Multifamily (10.4%), and Other (22.8%). As of December 31, 2017, no other individual property type comprised more than 10% of our total CMBS B-Piece portfolio. \n \u2022 Geography: California (23.1%), Texas (12.0%), New York (10.2%), Illinois (6.6%), Florida (5.4%), and Other (42.7%). As of December 31, 2017, no other individual geography comprised more than 5% of our total CMBS B-Piece portfolio. \n \u2022 Vintage: 2015 (58.5%), 2016 (30.6%), and 2017 (10.9%). \nThe following table details our loan activity (dollars in thousands): \n (A) Includes new loan originations and additional commitments made under existing loans. \n (B) Includes our share of the redemption payment from our preferred equity investment.  The following table details overall statistics for our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (A) In certain instances, we finance our loans through the non-recourse sale of a senior interest that is not included in our consolidated financial statements. Total loan exposure includes the entire loan we originated and financed, including $63.0 million of such non-consolidated interests that are not included within our balance sheet portfolio. \n (B) Unfunded commitments will primarily be funded to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by the borrowers. These future commitments will be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date. \n (C) As of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of floating rate loans by principal balance are indexed to one-month USD LIBOR. In addition to cash coupon, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, loan origination costs and purchase discounts. Cash coupon and all-in yield for the total portfolio assume applicable floating benchmark rates as of December 31, 2017. \n (D) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; however, our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2017, based on total loan exposure, 94.8% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 5.2% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. \n (E) Based on LTV as of the dates loans were originated or acquired by us. \nThe table below sets forth additional information relating to our portfolio as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in millions):\n\n * Numbers presented may not foot due to rounding. \n (A) Our total portfolio represents the current principal amount on senior and mezzanine loans and the net equity of our CMBS B-Piece investments. \n (B) Net equity reflects (i) the amortized cost basis of our loans, net of borrowings and a 5% noncontrolling interest in the entity that holds certain of our mezzanine loans; (ii) the cost basis of our CMBS B-Pieces, net of VIE liabilities; and (iii) the cost basis of our investment in RECOP. \n (C) Weighted average is weighted by current principal amount for our senior and mezzanine loans and by net equity for our CMBS B-Pieces. Weighted average coupon calculation includes one-month USD LIBOR for floating-rate mezzanine loans. \n (D) L = one-month USD LIBOR rate; spot rate of 1.56% included in mezzanine loan and portfolio-wide averages represented as fixed rates. \n (E) Max remaining term (years) assumes all extension options are exercised, if applicable. \n (F) For our senior and mezzanine loans, the LTV is based on the initial loan amount divided by the as-is appraised value as of the date the loan was originated. For Senior Loan 1, LTV is based on the total loan amount of $239.2 million divided by the appraised net sell-out value of $345.4 million. For Mezzanine Loan 1, LTV is based on the total loan amount divided by the as-is appraised value at March 17, 2017. For our CMBS B-Pieces, LTV is based on the weighted average LTV of the underlying loan pool at issuance. \n (G) Senior loans include senior mortgages and similar credit quality investments, including junior participations in our originated senior loans for which we have syndicated the senior participations and retained the junior participations for our portfolio. \n (H) Represents our investment in an aggregator vehicle alongside RECOP that invests in CMBS. Committed principal represents our total commitment to the aggregator vehicle whereas current principal represents the current funded amount. \nPortfolio Surveillance and Credit Quality\nSenior and Mezzanine Loans\nOur Manager actively manages our portfolio and assesses the risk of any loan impairment by quarterly evaluating the performance of the underlying property, the valuation of comparable assets as well as the financial wherewithal of the associated borrower. Our loan documents generally give us the right to receive regular property, borrower and guarantor financial statements; approve annual budgets and tenant leases; and enforce loan covenants and remedies. In addition, our Manager evaluates the macroeconomic environment, prevailing real estate fundamentals and micro-market dynamics where the underlying property is located. Through site inspections, local market experts and various data sources, as part of its risk assessment, our Manager monitors criteria such as new supply and tenant demand, market occupancy and rental rate trends, and capitalization rates and valuation trends.\nIn addition to ongoing asset management, our Manager performs a quarterly review of our portfolio whereby each loan is assigned a risk rating of 1 through 5, from lowest risk to highest risk. Our Manager is responsible for reviewing, assigning and updating the risk ratings for each loan on a quarterly basis. The risk ratings are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, underlying real estate performance and asset value, values of comparable properties, durability and quality of property cash flows, sponsor experience and financial wherewithal, and the existence of a risk-mitigating loan structure. Additional key considerations include LTVs, debt service coverage ratios, real estate and credit market dynamics, and risk of default or principal loss. Based on a five-point scale, our loans are rated \"1\" through \"5,\" from less risk to greater risk, which ratings are defined as follows:\n1-Very Low Risk-The underlying property performance has surpassed underwritten expectations, and the sponsor's business plan is generally complete. The property demonstrates stabilized occupancy and/or rental rates resulting in strong current cash flow and/or a very low LTV (<65%). At the level of performance, it is very likely that the underlying loan can be refinanced easily in the period's prevailing capital market conditions.\n2-Low Risk-The underlying property performance has matched or exceeded underwritten expectations, and the sponsor's business plan may be ahead of schedule or has achieved some or many of the major milestones from a risk mitigation perspective. The property has achieved improving occupancy at market rents, resulting in sufficient current cash flow and/or a low LTV (65%-70%). Operating trends are favorable, and the underlying loan can be refinanced in today's prevailing capital market conditions. The sponsor/manager is well capitalized or has demonstrated a history of success in owning or operating similar real estate.\n3-Average Risk-The underlying property performance is in-line with underwritten expectations, or the sponsor may be in the early stages of executing its business plan. Current cash flow supports debt service payments, or there is an ample interest reserve or loan structure in place to provide the sponsor time to execute the value-improvement plan.

During February 2016, we declared a dividend of $0.36 per share of common stock paid on February 5, 2016 to shareholders of record on February 3, 2016 related to income generated during the three months ended December 31, 2015.

Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings are measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define Core Earnings as net income (loss) attributable to our stockholders or, without duplication, owners of our subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss) and excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) the incentive compensation payable to our Manager, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income, and (v) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items after discussions between our Manager and our board of directors (and subject to the approval by a majority of our independent directors). The exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of Core Earnings only applies to debt investments related to real estate to the extent we foreclose upon the property or properties underlying such debt investments. Net Core Earnings is Core Earnings less incentive compensation payable to our Manager.\nWe believe providing Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings on a supplemental basis to our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP is helpful to stockholders in assessing the overall performance of our business. Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings should not be considered as a substitute for GAAP net income. We caution readers that our methodology for calculating Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings may differ from the methodologies employed by other REITs to calculate the same or similar supplemental performance measures, and as a result, our Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other REITs.\nWe also use Core Earnings to determine the management and incentive fees we pay our Manager. For information on the fees we pay our Manager, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders to Core Earnings and Net Core Earnings (amounts in thousands, except share and per share data):\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash equity compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation to affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>365\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized (gains) or losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,375\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,363\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings(A)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Incentive compensation to affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(365\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Core Earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,685,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,320,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,299,597\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,688,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,321,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,299,597\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Earnings per Diluted Weighted Average Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.46\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Core Earnings per Diluted Weighted Average Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (A) Excludes $1.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted weighted average share outstanding, of net original issue discount on CMBS B-Pieces accreted as a component of taxable income during the three months ended December 31, 2017.

Total loan exposure includes the entire loan we originated and financed, including $63.0 million of such non-consolidated interests that are not included within our balance sheet portfolio. \n (B) Unfunded commitments will primarily be funded to finance property improvements or lease-related expenditures by the borrowers. These future commitments will be funded over the term of each loan, subject in certain cases to an expiration date. \n (C) As of December 31, 2017, 100.0% of floating rate loans by principal balance are indexed to one-month USD LIBOR. In addition to cash coupon, all-in yield includes the amortization of deferred origination fees, loan origination costs and purchase discounts. Cash coupon and all-in yield for the total portfolio assume applicable floating benchmark rates as of December 31, 2017. \n (D) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower; however, our loans may be repaid prior to such date. As of December 31, 2017, based on total loan exposure, 94.8% of our loans were subject to yield maintenance or other prepayment restrictions and 5.2% were open to repayment by the borrower without penalty. \n (E) Based on LTV as of the dates loans were originated or acquired by us. \nThe table below sets forth additional information relating to our portfolio as of December 31, 2017 (dollars in

total portfolio represents the current principal amount on senior and mezzanine loans and the net equity of our CMBS B-Piece investments. \n (B) Net equity reflects (i) the amortized cost basis of our loans, net of borrowings and a 5% noncontrolling interest in the entity that holds certain of our mezzanine loans; (ii) the cost basis of our CMBS B-Pieces, net of VIE liabilities; and (iii) the cost basis of our investment in RECOP. \n (C) Weighted average is weighted by current principal amount for our senior and mezzanine loans and by net equity for our CMBS B-Pieces. Weighted average coupon calculation includes one-month USD LIBOR for floating-rate mezzanine loans. \n (D) L = one-month USD LIBOR rate; spot rate of 1.56% included in mezzanine loan and portfolio-wide averages represented as fixed rates. \n (E) Max remaining term (years) assumes all extension options are exercised, if applicable. \n (F) For our senior and mezzanine loans, the LTV is based on the initial loan amount divided by the as-is appraised value as of the date the loan was originated. For Senior Loan 1, LTV is based on the total loan amount of $239.2 million divided by the appraised net sell-out value of $345.4 million. For Mezzanine Loan 1, LTV is based on the total loan amount divided by the as-is appraised value at March 17, 2017. For our CMBS B-Pieces, LTV is based on the weighted average LTV of the underlying loan pool at issuance. \n (G) Senior loans include senior mortgages and similar credit quality investments, including junior participations in our originated senior loans for which we have syndicated the senior participations and retained the junior participations for our portfolio. \n (H) Represents our investment in an aggregator vehicle alongside RECOP that invests in CMBS. Committed principal represents our total commitment to the aggregator vehicle whereas current principal represents the current funded amount. \nPortfolio Surveillance and Credit Quality\nSenior and Mezzanine Loans\nOur Manager actively manages our portfolio and assesses the risk of any loan impairment by quarterly evaluating the performance of the underlying property, the valuation of comparable assets as well as the financial wherewithal of the associated borrower. Our loan documents generally give us the right to receive regular property, borrower and guarantor financial statements; approve annual budgets and tenant leases; and enforce loan covenants and remedies. In addition, our Manager evaluates the macroeconomic environment, prevailing real estate fundamentals and micro-market dynamics where the underlying property is located. Through site inspections, local market experts and various data sources, as part of its risk assessment, our Manager monitors criteria such as new supply and tenant demand, market occupancy and rental rate trends, and capitalization rates and valuation trends.\nIn addition to ongoing asset management, our Manager performs a quarterly review of our portfolio whereby each loan is assigned a risk rating of 1 through 5, from lowest risk to highest risk. Our Manager is responsible for reviewing, assigning and updating the risk ratings for each loan on a quarterly basis. The risk ratings are based on many factors, including, but not limited to, underlying real estate performance and asset value, values of comparable properties, durability and quality of property cash flows, sponsor experience and financial wherewithal, and the existence of a risk-mitigating loan structure. Additional key considerations include LTVs, debt service coverage ratios, real estate and credit market dynamics, and risk of default or principal loss. Based on a five-point scale, our loans are rated \"1\" through \"5,\" from less risk to greater risk, which ratings are defined as follows:\n1-Very Low Risk-The underlying property performance has surpassed underwritten expectations, and the sponsor's business plan is generally complete. The property demonstrates stabilized occupancy and/or rental rates resulting in strong current cash flow and/or a very low LTV (<65%). At the level of performance, it is very likely that the underlying loan can be refinanced easily in the period's prevailing capital market conditions.\n2-Low Risk-The underlying property performance has matched or exceeded underwritten expectations, and the sponsor's business plan may be ahead of schedule or has achieved some or many of the major milestones from a risk mitigation perspective. The property has achieved improving occupancy at market rents, resulting in sufficient current cash flow and/or a low LTV (65%-70%). Operating trends are favorable, and the underlying loan can be refinanced in today's prevailing capital market conditions. The sponsor/manager is well capitalized or has demonstrated a history of success in owning or operating similar real estate.\n3-Average Risk-The underlying property performance is in-line with underwritten expectations, or the sponsor may be in the early stages of executing its business plan. Current cash flow supports debt service payments, or there is an ample interest reserve or loan structure in place to provide the sponsor time to execute the value-improvement plan.
