Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Report.\nThis section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons. Similar discussion for 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons may be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of our final prospectus for our initial public offering, filed with the SEC on February 4, 2021.\nOverview\nWe provide a leading, cloud-based digital experience platform that enables businesses to convert customer engagement into revenue through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. Our platform's portfolio of interactive, personalized and content-rich digital experience products creates and captures actionable, real-time data at scale from millions of professionals every month to provide businesses with buying signals and behavioral insights to efficiently convert prospects into customers.\nSimilar to what has taken place in the B2C market, our digital experience platform empowers B2B companies with insights to better personalize their engagement. Large social media platforms have been successful at leveraging experiences and insights of consumers on their platforms to enable B2C companies to effectively understand their potential consumers. While these have been effective in the B2C market, B2B companies often lack deep insights about prospective customers to effectively understand and engage them.\nBusinesses today primarily use automated solutions, such as digital advertising and email, for marketing. While these automated solutions reach large numbers of prospective customers, they have generally failed to deepen customer engagement because they were designed with the simple purpose of pushing marketing messages in one direction-from the business to the prospective customer. For businesses to succeed, we believe their sales and marketing strategies must evolve from the era of automation to the era of engagement. Our platform provides an innovative way both to scale digital marketing and deepen prospective customer engagement. We believe our opportunity to help businesses convert digital engagement into revenue will continue to grow as industries modernize their sales and marketing processes, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe sell subscriptions to our platform's experience products that are backed by analytics and our ecosystem of third-party integrations. Before 2013, we offered services and licensed software for managing webinars and virtual events primarily on a per event basis. In 2013, we transitioned to be a software-as-a-service company with the release of ON24 Elite and ON24 Virtual Environment as cloud-based subscription products. Substantially all of our customers subscribe to ON24 Elite, which enables customers to seamlessly broadcast video-based content and drive real-time interactivity in a single immersive experience. Our customers can host multiple tracks of their webinar experiences as a large-scale virtual event experience using ON24 Virtual Environment.\nIn 2018, we launched two complementary experience products, ON24 Engagement Hub and ON24 Target, to provide our customers with a system for digital engagement, offering customers the ability to curate and disseminate rich, multimedia content experiences. In addition to our products, we also provide professional services such as experience management, monitoring and premium support services, which provide the opportunity for recurring revenue, as well as implementation and other services.\nWe deliver our platform products as cloud-based subscriptions that are easy to use and purpose-built for sales and marketing professionals. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 1,900 customers in more than 60 countries. We have a highly engaged and loyal customer base leading to a successful land and expand strategy. As of December 31, 2020, the number of customers with subscriptions to two or more of our experience products increased to 30% as compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPrior to developing our current cloud-based subscription model, we generated revenue from our Legacy offering, which primarily consisted of fully managed events and associated services. In connection with shifting to our current data-driven, cloud-based subscription model, we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and stopped selling it to all customers in 2020. As a result, substantially all Legacy revenue ceased after December 2020. Our revenue was $156.9 million, $89.1 million, and $82.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing period-over-period increase of 76% and 8% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue, excluding our Legacy offering, was $154.8 million, $80.7 million, and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing period-over-period increase of 92% and 17% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had net income of $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a net loss of $17.5 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged, and, by March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governments across the United States and around the world have instituted measures in an effort to slow infection rates, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions and mandated business closure. The global economic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and continue to evolve, as exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment, changes in consumer behavior and market volatility.\nThe imperative to optimize digital sales and marketing investments to drive revenue conversion has become more important as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased usage of our subscription and other platforms. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue increased by 76% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, in part due to the impact of COVID-19.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to experience such accelerated growth. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic subside, our customers and their users may resume in-person marketing activities in a way that decreases usage of our platform. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial performance may be influenced by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, future spikes of COVID-19 infections resulting in additional preventative and mitigative measures, the severity of the economic decline attributable to or influenced by the pandemic, the timing and nature of a potential economic recovery, the impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and our ability to generate new business leads. For additional details, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. We define a customer as a unique organization, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, that has entered into an agreement for paid access to our platform. A single customer may have multiple agreements with us for separate divisions, subsidiaries or affiliates. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend in part on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe we have a significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or the future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in our sales and marketing functions in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing and retaining talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nDespite our strong growth to date, we believe our market is still relatively underpenetrated and, as a result, we see significant opportunity to market our solutions globally. We estimate that our customer base of over 1,900 customers as of December 31, 2020 represents less than 1% of the number of companies that our solutions can address. We intend to pursue new customers through specialized and aligned sales teams focused on Enterprise and Commercial customers.\nRetention and Expansion of ON24 Across Existing Customers\nWe believe we can achieve significant growth by retaining and further penetrating our existing customer base with the addition of new users and new products, and through upsell and cross sell. Our multi-dimensional land and expand model drives onboarding and allows us to acquire customers via free trials, live demos and continuous engagement with an efficient sales and marketing investment. As we continue to drive more actionable revenue generating marketing insights, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to further increase sales among existing customers across different functional and geographic departments within each respective organization. Our ability to pursue this opportunity will require us to scale our sales and marketing organization and otherwise increase our operating expenses, and we may not be successful on the timetable we anticipate, or at all, for any number of reasons, which may cause our results to vary from period to period.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe plan to continually develop new products that enhance the functionality of our platform, improve our user experiences and drive customer engagement in order to further capitalize on new opportunities. We intend to sell these new solutions to both existing and new customers, to drive an increase in revenue as the breadth and depth of our solutions and use cases expands. We also intend to continue investing in our platform and related infrastructure to improve capacity, security and scalability. These development efforts will require significant investments, some of which may be episodic or otherwise cause our expenses to vary from period to period.\nInternational Expansion\nWe believe the expansion of real-time, revenue-generating marketing intelligence in international markets is a significant opportunity. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 24% and 21%, respectively, of our revenue came from outside the United States. We believe there is a compelling opportunity to expand our solutions internationally, both in countries where we currently operate and countries where we do not yet sell subscriptions to our solutions. Continuing to expand our international operations will require considerable management attention and other resources and may present challenges associated with complying with local expectations, customs, laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to sell subscriptions to our solutions and otherwise cause our results to vary from period to period.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Our methods for calculating these metrics may differ from similarly titled metrics at other companies, which may hinder comparability with other companies. The following table sets forth as of the dates indicated our number of customers, our ARR, our NRR, and our $100k Customers:\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NRR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $100k Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNumber of Customers\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our customer base. We define a customer as a unique organization, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, that has entered into an agreement for paid access to our platform. We serve customers of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to global Fortune 100 organizations across a diverse set of industries, including technology, financial services, healthcare, industrial and manufacturing, professional services and B2B information services companies. Our diverse customer base has grown from 760 customers as of December 31, 2015 to over 1,900 customers as of December 31, 2020. Our platform is designed with a long-term view toward our customer relationships and to grow with customers as their needs expand.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nWe believe that ARR is a key metric to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscription customers and to maintain and expand our relationship with existing subscription customers. ARR is calculated as the sum of the annualized value of our subscription contracts as of the measurement date, including existing customers with expired contracts that we expect to be renewed. Our ARR amounts exclude professional services, overages from subscription customers and Legacy revenue. Our ARR as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $153.4 million, $76.9 million, and $61.2 million, respectively. Our consistent ARR growth each quarter reflects our success in acquiring new customers and expanding subscriptions with existing customers, which was occurring prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerated in 2020 partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nWe believe NRR is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and organically grow revenue from our customers. Our NRR as of a specified period end is calculated by dividing current period ARR by prior period ARR. Prior period ARR is the ARR for all engagement platform customers as of twelve months prior to such period end. Current period ARR is the ARR for the same customers as of the specified period end. Our NRR includes the effect of any customer renewals, expansion, contraction and churn but excludes ARR from customers that were acquired in the twelve months prior to the specified period end. Our NRR is subject to adjustment for mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and similar transactions involving our customers. Our NRR was149%, 108% and 107% as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We believe our strong NRR reflects our success in retaining customers and expanding their subscriptions as customers realize the increasing importance of digital transformation, which accelerated in 2020 partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCustomers Contributing $100,000 or More to ARR\nWe believe that our ability to increase our $100k Customers is a key indicator for important components of the growth of our business, including our success in expanding the use of our platform within large organizations. We define $100k Customers as customers contributing at least $100,000 in ARR. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had 302, 144 and 116 customers, respectively, that contributed $100,000 or more of ARR, demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger organizations\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription and Other Platform Revenue\nSubscription and other platform revenue primarily consists of subscription fees from customer agreements to access our digital experience platform. Our customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We recognize subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract beginning on the date access to our platform is granted. Subscription and other platform revenue also includes usage fees from customers who acquire incremental capacity during their contract term. We recognize usage fees on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the subscription contract, beginning when usage occurs. We expect our subscription revenue to increase over the long-term, depending on our ability to attract new customers and expand usage with current customers, which fluctuate from period to period.\nSubscription and other platform revenue also contains revenue from our Legacy offering, which consists of contracts with customers for which we grant customers access to our platform only for the duration of specific contracted events. Our Legacy revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time as events occur. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018, and substantially all subscription and other platform revenue associated with our Legacy offering ceased after December 2020.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees from customer agreements to provide consulting services, including experience management, monitoring and production services, implementation services and premium support services. The majority of our professional services consists of experience management and monitoring services, which are prepaid rights to a defined number of managed and monitored experiences. Professional services are generally considered distinct from the access provided to our platform. Professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, as well as one-time and ongoing engagements. We recognize revenue from experience management, monitoring and production services in the period the experience occurs and the services are delivered or, if they are not used by the customer, at the end of the subscription term. We recognize revenue from implementation services upon completion of the services. We recognize revenue from premium support offerings on a ratable basis over the subscription term. We expect our professional services revenue to increase as our customer base and use of our platform by existing customers increases, which may fluctuate from period to period. This fluctuation may include seasonality, with increased customer utilization of our platform in the fourth quarter and decreased utilization in the first quarter, reflecting the timing of our customers' marketing initiatives and their internal budget cycles.\nProfessional services revenue also contains revenue from our Legacy offering, which consists of event-related services, and is recognized when the event occurs. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all professional services revenue associated with our Legacy offering ceased after December 2020.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscription and Other Platform Cost of Revenue\nSubscription and other platform cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our platform and providing operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, personnel-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees and allocated overhead. We expect our subscription and other platform cost of revenue to increase in the near term in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to move to a hybrid cloud and otherwise expand our infrastructure and, over the long term, to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.\nSubscription and other platform cost of revenue also includes Legacy cost of revenue. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and the Legacy component of subscription and other platform cost of revenue substantially ceased after December 2020 consistent with related revenue.\nProfessional Services Cost of Revenue\nProfessional services cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, third-party consulting services and allocated overhead. We expect our professional services cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our professional services revenue increases.\nProfessional services cost of revenue also includes Legacy cost of revenue. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all of the Legacy component of professional services cost of revenue ceased after December 2020 consistent with related revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with our sales and marketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include promotional events to promote our brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, tradeshows and our annual user conference, software license expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions that are directly related to acquiring customer contracts, as well as associated payroll taxes, are deferred upon execution of a contract with a customer, and subsequently amortized to sales and marketing expense. Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, as we specifically anticipate renewals of the customer contracts and commissions paid on renewal contracts are not commensurate with commissions paid on new customer contracts. Sales commissions paid upon renewal of customer contracts are amortized over the contractual renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Sales commissions paid related to professional services are amortized over the expected service period. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, primarily through increased headcount in our sales and marketing functions and investment in brand- and product marketing efforts. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term. However, we expect such expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with our research and development employees, contractor costs related to third-party development and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on further developing our platform and infrastructure. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses will increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits for our personnel in executive, finance, legal and human resources organizations. In addition, these expenses include external legal costs, accounting and other consulting services, bad debt expense and allocated overhead.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations and professional services. As a result, we expect the absolute dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period.\nOther Gains from Operations\nOther gains from operations consists of a one-time gain from a legal settlement.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense incurred on our Revolving Credit Facility, and income earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net consists primarily of currency transaction gains or losses and miscellaneous non-operational income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nResults of Operations\nWe manage and operate as one reportable segment.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in subscription and other platform revenue of $54.9 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $19.2 million mainly due to increases in our customer base, as well as the increase in use of our platform by our existing customers, which reflects an increase in demand for our experience management and monitoring services.\nTotal legacy revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $6.3 million, or 75%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily attributable to a decrease in subscription and other Legacy platform revenue as we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018.

The increase in total digital experience platform cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.5 million due to increased headcount to support our platform and deliver services, a $1.9 million increase in bandwidth, transmission and software costs due to the expansion of infrastructure and data centers, and a $1.5 million increase in contractor costs and consulting service fees.\nTotal legacy cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $2.4 million, or 62%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in total Legacy cost of revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in headcount and facilities allocation costs as we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all Legacy revenue ceased after December 2020.\nGross Margin\nGross margin in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 79% as compared to 70% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the significant increase in total digital experience platform revenue, which increased by 92%, compared to our digital experience platform cost of revenue, which increased by 37%.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $9.9 million due to increased headcount to support the growth in our sales force, a $4.4 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses due to increased demand generation activity, and a $0.9 million increase in recruiting costs. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of $1.9 million and conferences and events expenses of $1.4 million, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResearch and Development\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to an increase of $2.3 million in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount for the development of our solutions, an increase of $0.8 million in contractor costs for development activities and an increase of $0.5 million in facilities and other expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to an increase of $3.7 million in professional, legal and accounting related expenses mainly as a result of additional expenses incurred to prepare for the IPO, an increase of $2.4 million in personnel-related expenses due to increased headcount, an increase in bad debt expense of $0.8 million and an increase in facilities and other expenses of $0.5 million.

Our investments generally consist of money market funds and certificates of deposit which are short-term in nature.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through sales of convertible preferred stock and payments from our customers. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued 2,310,067 shares of Class B-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock for an aggregate amount of $25.0 million. We also have a Revolving Credit Facility to obtain up to $30.0 million in debt financing. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $22.4 million and $22.4 million, respectively, aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, which we repaid in full subsequent to December 31, 2020. Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been to fund our operations, invest in research and development and to purchase investments.\nIn February 2021, we raised net proceeds of $348.1 million in our IPO, after deducting the underwriting discount of $26.6 million and other estimated offering costs of $5.3 million.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses associated with our international expansion, including the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and we may need to\nseek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is needed from outside sources, we may not be able to raise the necessary capital or raise the capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,350\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,162\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our customers for subscriptions to use our platform. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are from personnel-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our platform and marketing expenses. Our cash flow from operating activities will continue to be influenced principally by the extent to which we increase spending on our business and our working capital requirements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization expenses, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to our net income of $20.8 million and non-cash charges for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs of $11.1 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.0 million, stock-based compensation of $2.9 million, and provision for accounts receivable allowance of $3.0 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flows from operations by $3.3 million primarily attributable to an unfavorable change in accounts receivable of $29.0 million due to timing of cash receipts from customers, an unfavorable change in deferred contract acquisition costs of $26.4 million driven by an increase in subscriptions, and an unfavorable change in prepaid expense and other assets of $2.9 million driven mainly by timing of prepayments and increased business activities, partially offset by a favorable change in accrued liabilities of $5.0 million primarily due to higher accrued compensation costs driven by increased headcount and higher accrued professional and other service costs driven by company growth, a favorable change in accounts payable of $2.0 million due to timing of payments to vendors, and a favorable change in deferred revenue of $48.0 million due to increases in subscriptions.\nNet cash used in operating activities of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to net loss of $17.5 million, partially offset by non-cash charges for amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs of $7.0 million due to the adoption of Topic 606, depreciation and amortization of $2.3 million, stock-based compensation of $2.0 million and provision for accounts receivable allowances of $0.7 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flows from operations by $5.8 million primarily due an increase in deferred contract acquisition costs of $9.0 million due to the adoption of Topic 606, an increase in accounts receivable of $5.4 million due to increases in subscriptions, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $0.3 million, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $0.3 million and a decrease in other long-term liabilities of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $9.4 million due to increases in subscriptions.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to net proceeds from settlements of short-term investments of $2.0 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $1.0 million to support ongoing operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to net purchases of short-term investments of $3.0 million and capital expenditures of $1.2 million to support ongoing operations.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.8 million, partially offset by payments of IPO related costs of $1.9 million and the repayment of capital lease obligations of $1.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $27.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the issuance of Class B-1 preferred stock of $25.0 million, net proceeds of $3.3 million from the draw down and repayment on the Revolving Credit Facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.4 million, partially offset by the repayment of capital lease obligations of $1.1 million.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are primarily annual and to a lesser extent, multi-year. We may bill for the full term in advance or on an annual or monthly basis, depending on the terms of the agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $148.3 million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $93.4 million and unbilled consideration in the amount of $54.9 million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 70% of the revenue for our remaining performance obligations in 2021 and the remainder thereafter.\nDebt Obligations\nRevolving Credit Facility\nIn April 2013, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Comerica Bank, which was subsequently amended and restated, and provides us the ability to borrow up to $30.0 million with a letter of credit sublimit of $3.9 million and a credit card sublimit of $0.7 million. The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a security interest on substantially all of our assets. As of the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had drawn $22.4 million and $22.4 million, respectively, against the Revolving Credit Facility. Outstanding principal amounts on the Revolving Credit Facility incur interest at the prime rate, as published by the Wall Street Journal (Prime Rate), plus 0,75% effective July 31, 2020 and prime rate, plus 0.50% prior to July 31, 2020. The prime rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 3.25% and 4.75%, respectively. Interest expense on the Revolving Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $0.7 million and $1.2 million, respectively.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2020, we repaid in full the remaining outstanding balance under our Revolving Credit facility of $22.4 million.\nEquipment Loan Agreements\nWe have entered into various equipment loan agreements that allow us to obtain financing to purchase equipment. Borrowings are secured by the equipment purchased. The equipment loan agreements are repaid over 36 months beginning from the date of the advance at an interest rate ranging from 6.5% to 10.1%. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, we owed $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, on the equipment loans.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our noncancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other debt including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Significant Judgments, and Use of Estimates\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those accounting policies and estimates that are both the most important to the portrayal of our net assets and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the nature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial condition or operating performance is material.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our platform and related services. We elected to adopt Topic 606, effective as of January 1, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method of adoption. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs-Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively, references to Topic 606 used herein refer to both Topic 606 and Subtopic 340-40. Accordingly, our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented under Topic 606, with the cumulative impact of the adoption of Topic 606 recorded on January 1, 2019. The primary impact of the adoption of Topic 606 was the capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers. See Note 1, Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIn accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model in accounting for our revenue arrangements:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party's rights regarding the services to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer has the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the combined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the customer's ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer's historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services and the products is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nOur performance obligations generally consist of access to our digital experience platform and related support services, which, together, are considered one performance obligation. Our customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform we provide a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription. Customers may also purchase incremental capacity to our digital experience platform. We recognize incremental access as a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the remaining term of the subscription. Our Legacy offering includes performance obligations to provide customers with access to our platform for the duration of specific contracted events, and revenue is recognized primarily as events occur. Amounts related to our digital experience platform and our Legacy offering are recorded as subscription and other platform revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe also provide professional services, which include consulting services, such as experience management, monitoring and production services, implementation services and premium support services. Professional services are generally considered distinct from the access to our digital experience platform. Amounts are recorded as Professional Services revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\nWe enter into contracts with customers that regularly include promises to transfer multiple services through access to our platform. For arrangements with multiple services, we evaluate whether the individual services qualify as distinct performance obligations. In our assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, we determine whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources and whether the service is separately identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires us to assess the nature of each individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services are significantly integrated, highly interrelated or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur. We apply the practical expedient in Topic 606 paragraph 10-32-18 and do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component for contracts that are one year or less, and none of our multi-year contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities, such as sales and other indirect taxes.\nOur digital experience platform and related support services are typically warranted to perform in a professional manner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form of variable consideration. Historically, we have not experienced any significant incidents affecting the defined levels of reliability and performance as required by the subscription agreements. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on each performance obligation's relative standalone selling price, or the SSP. The SSP is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. In instances where we do not sell or price a product or service separately, establishing SSP requires significant judgement. We estimate the SSP by considering available information, such as market conditions, internally approved pricing guidelines and the underlying cost of delivering the performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of the promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. We recognize subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the applicable contract subscription period beginning on the date access to our platform is granted. We recognize revenue from consulting services related to events in the period the event occurs and the service is delivered. We recognize revenue from implementation services upon completion of the services. We recognize revenue from premium support offerings on a ratable basis over the applicable subscription term.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nPrior to the adoption of Topic 606, costs associated with obtaining customer contracts were recorded as sales and marketing expenses in the period the related customer contract was signed. Subsequent to the adoption of Topic 606, we capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel and third-party referral fees that are incremental to the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs on our consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our sales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer contract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, as we specifically anticipate renewals of customer contracts and commissions paid on renewal contracts are not commensurate with commissions paid on new customer contracts. Sales commissions paid upon renewal of customer contracts are amortized over the contractual renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Sales commissions paid related to professional services are amortized over the expected service period. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and the technological life of our platform and related significant features. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards is recognized based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used to determine the fair value of the option awards represent management's best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement's judgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the awards, which is generally four years. We estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting option forfeitures and record stock-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates are as follows:\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fair Value of Common Stock. As our common stock was not publicly traded prior to the IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input from management and valuation reports prepared by independent third-party valuation firms. For valuations of option grants made after the closing of our IPO, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of common stock based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, or other relevant determination date, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the expected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For stock options granted to nonemployees, the expected term equals the contractual term of the option.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Volatility. As we do not have a trading history for our common stock prior to the IPO, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in our industry which are either similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to declare or pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Black-Scholes assumptions used in evaluating our awards are as follows:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2.32 - $33.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2.32 - $3.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $2.15 - $2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4% - 1.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5% - 2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.7% - 3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected terms (years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.6% - 62.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.7% - 51.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.5% - 58.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimation process, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nFor periods prior to the closing of our IPO, the fair value of our business, or enterprise value, was determined using either the market approach or a combination of the market and income approaches. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company's financial results to estimate the value of the subject company. The income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present value of the company's future estimated cash flows and the residual value of the company beyond the forecast period. These future cash flows, including the cash flows beyond the forecast period for the residual value, are discounted to their present values using an appropriate discount rate, to reflect the risks inherent in the company achieving these estimated cash flows.\nFor valuations prior to October 1, 2019, the resulting equity value is then allocated to each class of stock using the Option Pricing Method, or the OPM. The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common stock is modeled as a call option with a claim on the equity value at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible preferred stock is liquidated. For valuations as of and subsequent to October 1, 2019, we have used a hybrid method utilizing a combination of the OPM and the probability-weighted expected return method, which includes a probability-weighted analysis of varying values for our common stock assuming possible future events for our company, including scenarios for completing an initial public offering, completing an acquisition, and remaining a private company. Prior October 1, 2019, we believed the use of the OPM was appropriate because the range of possible future outcomes was difficult to predict and highly speculative. Under either methodology, after the equity value was determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM, was applied to arrive at the fair value of common stock on a non-marketable basis. A DLOM is applied based on the theory that the stockholder of a private company has limited information and opportunities to sell their stock. A market participant that would purchase this stock would recognize this risk and thereby require a higher rate of return, which would reduce the overall fair market value.\nOur assessments of the fair value of common stock for grant dates were based in part on the current available financial and operational information and the common stock value provided in the most recent valuation as compared to the timing of each grant. For financial reporting purposes, we considered the amount of time between the valuation date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest common stock valuation or a straight-line interpolation between the two valuation dates. This determination included an evaluation of whether the subsequent valuation indicated that any significant change in valuation had occurred between the previous valuation and the grant date. For valuations during the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined the fair values of each share of common stock based on a straight-line interpolation between the valuation date of September 15, 2020, the date on which we first obtained a third-party valuation after we held our IPO organizational meeting on September 3, 2020, and the midpoint of the preliminary IPO price range on an assumed pricing on February 2, 2021, the day prior to our shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nFor valuations after February 3, 2021, when our shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in connection with our IPO, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of common stock based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, or other relevant determination date, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\nJOBS Act Accounting Election\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards. Accordingly, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or that have opted out of using such extended transition period.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for more information.", "summary": "Summary:\nThe report provides a detailed overview of the financial condition and results of operations of the company.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this Report.\nThis section generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons. Similar discussion for 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons may be found in the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section of our final prospectus for our initial public offering, filed with the SEC on February 4, 2021.\nOverview\nWe provide a leading, cloud-based digital experience platform that enables businesses to convert customer engagement into revenue through interactive webinar experiences, virtual event experiences and multimedia content experiences. Our platform's portfolio of interactive, personalized and content-rich digital experience products creates and captures actionable, real-time data at scale from millions of professionals every month to provide businesses with buying signals and behavioral insights to efficiently convert prospects into customers.\nSimilar to what has taken place in the B2C market, our digital experience platform empowers B2B companies with insights to better personalize their engagement. Large social media platforms have been successful at leveraging experiences and insights of consumers on their platforms to enable B2C companies to effectively understand their potential consumers. While these have been effective in the B2C market, B2B companies often lack deep insights about prospective customers to effectively understand and engage them.\nBusinesses today primarily use automated solutions, such as digital advertising and email, for marketing. While these automated solutions reach large numbers of prospective customers, they have generally failed to deepen customer engagement because they were designed with the simple purpose of pushing marketing messages in one direction-from the business to the prospective customer. For businesses to succeed, we believe their sales and marketing strategies must evolve from the era of automation to the era of engagement. Our platform provides an innovative way both to scale digital marketing and deepen prospective customer engagement. We believe our opportunity to help businesses convert digital engagement into revenue will continue to grow as industries modernize their sales and marketing processes, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe sell subscriptions to our platform's experience products that are backed by analytics and our ecosystem of third-party integrations. Before 2013, we offered services and licensed software for managing webinars and virtual events primarily on a per event basis. In 2013, we transitioned to be a software-as-a-service company with the release of ON24 Elite and ON24 Virtual Environment as cloud-based subscription products. Substantially all of our customers subscribe to ON24 Elite, which enables customers to seamlessly broadcast video-based content and drive real-time interactivity in a single immersive experience. Our customers can host multiple tracks of their webinar experiences as a large-scale virtual event experience using ON24 Virtual Environment.\nIn 2018, we launched two complementary experience products, ON24 Engagement Hub and ON24 Target, to provide our customers with a system for digital engagement, offering customers the ability to curate and disseminate rich, multimedia content experiences. In addition to our products, we also provide professional services such as experience management, monitoring and premium support services, which provide the opportunity for recurring revenue, as well as implementation and other services.\nWe deliver our platform products as cloud-based subscriptions that are easy to use and purpose-built for sales and marketing professionals. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 1,900 customers in more than 60 countries. We have a highly engaged and loyal customer base leading to a successful land and expand strategy. As of December 31, 2020, the number of customers with subscriptions to two or more of our experience products increased to 30% as compared to 17% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPrior to developing our current cloud-based subscription model, we generated revenue from our Legacy offering, which primarily consisted of fully managed events and associated services. In connection with shifting to our current data-driven, cloud-based subscription model, we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and stopped selling it to all customers in 2020. As a result, substantially all Legacy revenue ceased after December 2020. Our revenue was $156.9 million, $89.1 million, and $82.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing period-over-period increase of 76% and 8% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our revenue, excluding our Legacy offering, was $154.8 million, $80.7 million, and $68.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, representing period-over-period increase of 92% and 17% for 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had net income of $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a net loss of $17.5 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged, and, by March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governments across the United States and around the world have instituted measures in an effort to slow infection rates, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions and mandated business closure. The global economic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and continue to evolve, as exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment, changes in consumer behavior and market volatility.\nThe imperative to optimize digital sales and marketing investments to drive revenue conversion has become more important as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased usage of our subscription and other platforms. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue increased by 76% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, in part due to the impact of COVID-19.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to experience such accelerated growth. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic subside, our customers and their users may resume in-person marketing activities in a way that decreases usage of our platform. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial performance may be influenced by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, future spikes of COVID-19 infections resulting in additional preventative and mitigative measures, the severity of the economic decline attributable to or influenced by the pandemic, the timing and nature of a potential economic recovery, the impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and our ability to generate new business leads. For additional details, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. We define a customer as a unique organization, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, that has entered into an agreement for paid access to our platform. A single customer may have multiple agreements with us for separate divisions, subsidiaries or affiliates. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend in part on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe we have a significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or the future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in our sales and marketing functions in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing and retaining talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nDespite our strong growth to date, we believe our market is still relatively underpenetrated and, as a result, we see significant opportunity to market our solutions globally. We estimate that our customer base of over 1,900 customers as of December 31, 2020 represents less than 1% of the number of companies that our solutions can address. We intend to pursue new customers through specialized and aligned sales teams focused on Enterprise and Commercial customers.\nRetention and Expansion of ON24 Across Existing Customers\nWe believe we can achieve significant growth by retaining and further penetrating our existing customer base with the addition of new users and new products, and through upsell and cross sell. Our multi-dimensional land and expand model drives onboarding and allows us to acquire customers via free trials, live demos and continuous engagement with an efficient sales and marketing investment. As we continue to drive more actionable revenue generating marketing insights, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to further increase sales among existing customers across different functional and geographic departments within each respective organization. Our ability to pursue this opportunity will require us to scale our sales and marketing organization and otherwise increase our operating expenses, and we may not be successful on the timetable we anticipate, or at all, for any number of reasons, which may cause our results to vary from period to period.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe plan to continually develop new products that enhance the functionality of our platform, improve our user experiences and drive customer engagement in order to further capitalize on new opportunities. We intend to sell these new solutions to both existing and new customers, to drive an increase in revenue as the breadth and depth of our solutions and use cases expands. We also intend to continue investing in our platform and related infrastructure to improve capacity, security and scalability. These development efforts will require significant investments, some of which may be episodic or otherwise cause our expenses to vary from period to period.\nInternational Expansion\nWe believe the expansion of real-time, revenue-generating marketing intelligence in international markets is a significant opportunity. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 24% and 21%, respectively, of our revenue came from outside the United States. We believe there is a compelling opportunity to expand our solutions internationally, both in countries where we currently operate and countries where we do not yet sell subscriptions to our solutions. Continuing to expand our international operations will require considerable management attention and other resources and may present challenges associated with complying with local expectations, customs, laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to sell subscriptions to our solutions and otherwise cause our results to vary from period to period.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Our methods for calculating these metrics may differ from similarly titled metrics at other companies, which may hinder comparability with other companies. The following table sets forth as of the dates indicated our number of customers, our ARR, our NRR, and our $100k Customers:\n\nNumber of Customers\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our customer base. We define a customer as a unique organization, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, that has entered into an agreement for paid access to our platform. We serve customers of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to global Fortune 100 organizations across a diverse set of industries, including technology, financial services, healthcare, industrial and manufacturing, professional services and B2B information services companies. Our diverse customer base has grown from 760 customers as of December 31, 2015 to over 1,900 customers as of December 31, 2020. Our platform is designed with a long-term view toward our customer relationships and to grow with customers as their needs expand.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nWe believe that ARR is a key metric to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscription customers and to maintain and expand our relationship with existing subscription customers. ARR is calculated as the sum of the annualized value of our subscription contracts as of the measurement date, including existing customers with expired contracts that we expect to be renewed. Our ARR amounts exclude professional services, overages from subscription customers and Legacy revenue. Our ARR as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $153.4 million, $76.9 million, and $61.2 million, respectively. Our consistent ARR growth each quarter reflects our success in acquiring new customers and expanding subscriptions with existing customers, which was occurring prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerated in 2020 partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nWe believe NRR is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and organically grow revenue from our customers. Our NRR as of a specified period end is calculated by dividing current period ARR by prior period ARR. Prior period ARR is the ARR for all engagement platform customers as of twelve months prior to such period end. Current period ARR is the ARR for the same customers as of the specified period end. Our NRR includes the effect of any customer renewals, expansion, contraction and churn but excludes ARR from customers that were acquired in the twelve months prior to the specified period end. Our NRR is subject to adjustment for mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and similar transactions involving our customers. Our NRR was149%, 108% and 107% as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We believe our strong NRR reflects our success in retaining customers and expanding their subscriptions as customers realize the increasing importance of digital transformation, which accelerated in 2020 partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCustomers Contributing $100,000 or More to ARR\nWe believe that our ability to increase our $100k Customers is a key indicator for important components of the growth of our business, including our success in expanding the use of our platform within large organizations. We define $100k Customers as customers contributing at least $100,000 in ARR. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had 302, 144 and 116 customers, respectively, that contributed $100,000 or more of ARR, demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger organizations\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription and Other Platform Revenue\nSubscription and other platform revenue primarily consists of subscription fees from customer agreements to access our digital experience platform. Our customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We recognize subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract beginning on the date access to our platform is granted. Subscription and other platform revenue also includes usage fees from customers who acquire incremental capacity during their contract term. We recognize usage fees on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the subscription contract, beginning when usage occurs. We expect our subscription revenue to increase over the long-term, depending on our ability to attract new customers and expand usage with current customers, which fluctuate from period to period.\nSubscription and other platform revenue also contains revenue from our Legacy offering, which consists of contracts with customers for which we grant customers access to our platform only for the duration of specific contracted events. Our Legacy revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time as events occur. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018, and substantially all subscription and other platform revenue associated with our Legacy offering ceased after December 2020.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees from customer agreements to provide consulting services, including experience management, monitoring and production services, implementation services and premium support services. The majority of our professional services consists of experience management and monitoring services, which are prepaid rights to a defined number of managed and monitored experiences. Professional services are generally considered distinct from the access provided to our platform. Professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, as well as one-time and ongoing engagements. We recognize revenue from experience management, monitoring and production services in the period the experience occurs and the services are delivered or, if they are not used by the customer, at the end of the subscription term. We recognize revenue from implementation services upon completion of the services. We recognize revenue from premium support offerings on a ratable basis over the subscription term. We expect our professional services revenue to increase as our customer base and use of our platform by existing customers increases, which may fluctuate from period to period. This fluctuation may include seasonality, with increased customer utilization of our platform in the fourth quarter and decreased utilization in the first quarter, reflecting the timing of our customers' marketing initiatives and their internal budget cycles.\nProfessional services revenue also contains revenue from our Legacy offering, which consists of event-related services, and is recognized when the event occurs. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all professional services revenue associated with our Legacy offering ceased after December 2020.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscription and Other Platform Cost of Revenue\nSubscription and other platform cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our platform and providing operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, personnel-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees and allocated overhead. We expect our subscription and other platform cost of revenue to increase in the near term in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to move to a hybrid cloud and otherwise expand our infrastructure and, over the long term, to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.\nSubscription and other platform cost of revenue also includes Legacy cost of revenue. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and the Legacy component of subscription and other platform cost of revenue substantially ceased after December 2020 consistent with related revenue.\nProfessional Services Cost of Revenue\nProfessional services cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, third-party consulting services and allocated overhead. We expect our professional services cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our professional services revenue increases.\nProfessional services cost of revenue also includes Legacy cost of revenue. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all of the Legacy component of professional services cost of revenue ceased after December 2020 consistent with related revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with our sales and marketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include promotional events to promote our brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, tradeshows and our annual user conference, software license expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions that are directly related to acquiring customer contracts, as well as associated payroll taxes, are deferred upon execution of a contract with a customer, and subsequently amortized to sales and marketing expense. Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, as we specifically anticipate renewals of the customer contracts and commissions paid on renewal contracts are not commensurate with commissions paid on new customer contracts. Sales commissions paid upon renewal of customer contracts are amortized over the contractual renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Sales commissions paid related to professional services are amortized over the expected service period. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, primarily through increased headcount in our sales and marketing functions and investment in brand- and product marketing efforts. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term. However, we expect such expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with our research and development employees, contractor costs related to third-party development and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on further developing our platform and infrastructure. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses will increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits for our personnel in executive, finance, legal and human resources organizations. In addition, these expenses include external legal costs, accounting and other consulting services, bad debt expense and allocated overhead.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations and professional services. As a result, we expect the absolute dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period.\nOther Gains from Operations\nOther gains from operations consists of a one-time gain from a legal settlement.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense incurred on our Revolving Credit Facility, and income earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net consists primarily of currency transaction gains or losses and miscellaneous non-operational income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nResults of Operations\nWe manage and operate as one reportable segment. The discussion below summarize our results of operations for the periods presented, which we derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\n\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $67.8 million, or 76%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in digital experience platform revenue and partially offset by a decrease in Legacy revenue.\n\nTotal digital experience platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $74.1 million, or 92%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in subscription and other platform revenue of $54.9 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $19.2 million mainly due to increases in our customer base, as well as the increase in use of our platform by our existing customers, which reflects an increase in demand for our experience management and monitoring services.\nTotal legacy revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $6.3 million, or 75%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily attributable to a decrease in subscription and other Legacy platform revenue as we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018. Substantially all Legacy revenue ceased after December 2020.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Margin\n\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $6.2 million, or 23%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in digital experience platform and professional services revenue and partially offset by a decrease in Legacy cost of revenue.\nTotal digital experience platform cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $8.5 million, or 37%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in subscription and other platform cost of revenue of $5.2 million and an increase in professional services cost of revenue of $3.3 million. The increase in total digital experience platform cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.5 million due to increased headcount to support our platform and deliver services, a $1.9 million increase in bandwidth, transmission and software costs due to the expansion of infrastructure and data centers, and a $1.5 million increase in contractor costs and consulting service fees.\nTotal legacy cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $2.4 million, or 62%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in total Legacy cost of revenue was primarily driven by a reduction in headcount and facilities allocation costs as we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all Legacy revenue ceased after December 2020.\nGross Margin\nGross margin in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased to 79% as compared to 70% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the significant increase in total digital experience platform revenue, which increased by 92%, compared to our digital experience platform cost of revenue, which increased by 37%.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily attributable to an increase in personnel-related expenses of $9.9 million due to increased headcount to support the growth in our sales force, a $4.4 million increase in marketing and advertising expenses due to increased demand generation activity, and a $0.9 million increase in recruiting costs. These increases were partly offset by a decrease in travel related expenses of $1.9 million and conferences and events expenses of $1.4 million, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResearch and Development\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

We had net income of $20.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a net loss of $17.5 million and $17.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 emerged, and, by March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governments across the United States and around the world have instituted measures in an effort to slow infection rates, including orders to shelter-in-place, travel restrictions and mandated business closure. The global economic impacts of COVID-19 are significant and continue to evolve, as exhibited by, among other things, a rise in unemployment, changes in consumer behavior and market volatility.\nThe imperative to optimize digital sales and marketing investments to drive revenue conversion has become more important as businesses accelerate digital transformation initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in increased usage of our subscription and other platforms. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenue increased by 76% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, in part due to the impact of COVID-19.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to experience such accelerated growth. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic subside, our customers and their users may resume in-person marketing activities in a way that decreases usage of our platform. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial performance may be influenced by a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, future spikes of COVID-19 infections resulting in additional preventative and mitigative measures, the severity of the economic decline attributable to or influenced by the pandemic, the timing and nature of a potential economic recovery, the impact on our customers and our sales cycles, and our ability to generate new business leads. For additional details, see the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. We define a customer as a unique organization, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, that has entered into an agreement for paid access to our platform. A single customer may have multiple agreements with us for separate divisions, subsidiaries or affiliates. Our operating results and growth prospects will depend in part on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe we have a significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or the future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in our sales and marketing functions in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing and retaining talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nDespite our strong growth to date, we believe our market is still relatively underpenetrated and, as a result, we see significant opportunity to market our solutions globally. We estimate that our customer base of over 1,900 customers as of December 31, 2020 represents less than 1% of the number of companies that our solutions can address. We intend to pursue new customers through specialized and aligned sales teams focused on Enterprise and Commercial customers.\nRetention and Expansion of ON24 Across Existing Customers\nWe believe we can achieve significant growth by retaining and further penetrating our existing customer base with the addition of new users and new products, and through upsell and cross sell. Our multi-dimensional land and expand model drives onboarding and allows us to acquire customers via free trials, live demos and continuous engagement with an efficient sales and marketing investment. As we continue to drive more actionable revenue generating marketing insights, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to further increase sales among existing customers across different functional and geographic departments within each respective organization. Our ability to pursue this opportunity will require us to scale our sales and marketing organization and otherwise increase our operating expenses, and we may not be successful on the timetable we anticipate, or at all, for any number of reasons, which may cause our results to vary from period to period.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe plan to continually develop new products that enhance the functionality of our platform, improve our user experiences and drive customer engagement in order to further capitalize on new opportunities. We intend to sell these new solutions to both existing and new customers, to drive an increase in revenue as the breadth and depth of our solutions and use cases expands. We also intend to continue investing in our platform and related infrastructure to improve capacity, security and scalability. These development efforts will require significant investments, some of which may be episodic or otherwise cause our expenses to vary from period to period.\nInternational Expansion\nWe believe the expansion of real-time, revenue-generating marketing intelligence in international markets is a significant opportunity. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 24% and 21%, respectively, of our revenue came from outside the United States. We believe there is a compelling opportunity to expand our solutions internationally, both in countries where we currently operate and countries where we do not yet sell subscriptions to our solutions. Continuing to expand our international operations will require considerable management attention and other resources and may present challenges associated with complying with local expectations, customs, laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to sell subscriptions to our solutions and otherwise cause our results to vary from period to period.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Our methods for calculating these metrics may differ from similarly titled metrics at other companies, which may hinder comparability with other companies. The following table sets forth as of the dates indicated our number of customers, our ARR, our NRR, and our $100k Customers:\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 153,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 76,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NRR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> $100k Customers\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNumber of Customers\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our customer base. We define a customer as a unique organization, including its subsidiaries and affiliates, that has entered into an agreement for paid access to our platform. We serve customers of all sizes, ranging from small businesses to global Fortune 100 organizations across a diverse set of industries, including technology, financial services, healthcare, industrial and manufacturing, professional services and B2B information services companies. Our diverse customer base has grown from 760 customers as of December 31, 2015 to over 1,900 customers as of December 31, 2020. Our platform is designed with a long-term view toward our customer relationships and to grow with customers as their needs expand.\nAnnual Recurring Revenue\nWe believe that ARR is a key metric to measure our business because it is driven by our ability to acquire new subscription customers and to maintain and expand our relationship with existing subscription customers. ARR is calculated as the sum of the annualized value of our subscription contracts as of the measurement date, including existing customers with expired contracts that we expect to be renewed. Our ARR amounts exclude professional services, overages from subscription customers and Legacy revenue. Our ARR as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $153.4 million, $76.9 million, and $61.2 million, respectively. Our consistent ARR growth each quarter reflects our success in acquiring new customers and expanding subscriptions with existing customers, which was occurring prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerated in 2020 partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDollar-Based Net Retention Rate\nWe believe NRR is an important metric that provides insight into the long-term value of our subscription agreements and our ability to retain and organically grow revenue from our customers. Our NRR as of a specified period end is calculated by dividing current period ARR by prior period ARR. Prior period ARR is the ARR for all engagement platform customers as of twelve months prior to such period end. Current period ARR is the ARR for the same customers as of the specified period end. Our NRR includes the effect of any customer renewals, expansion, contraction and churn but excludes ARR from customers that were acquired in the twelve months prior to the specified period end. Our NRR is subject to adjustment for mergers, acquisitions, dispositions and similar transactions involving our customers. Our NRR was149%, 108% and 107% as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We believe our strong NRR reflects our success in retaining customers and expanding their subscriptions as customers realize the increasing importance of digital transformation, which accelerated in 2020 partly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCustomers Contributing $100,000 or More to ARR\nWe believe that our ability to increase our $100k Customers is a key indicator for important components of the growth of our business, including our success in expanding the use of our platform within large organizations. We define $100k Customers as customers contributing at least $100,000 in ARR. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had 302, 144 and 116 customers, respectively, that contributed $100,000 or more of ARR, demonstrating our rapid penetration of larger organizations\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nSubscription and Other Platform Revenue\nSubscription and other platform revenue primarily consists of subscription fees from customer agreements to access our digital experience platform. Our customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We recognize subscription revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract beginning on the date access to our platform is granted. Subscription and other platform revenue also includes usage fees from customers who acquire incremental capacity during their contract term. We recognize usage fees on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the subscription contract, beginning when usage occurs. We expect our subscription revenue to increase over the long-term, depending on our ability to attract new customers and expand usage with current customers, which fluctuate from period to period.\nSubscription and other platform revenue also contains revenue from our Legacy offering, which consists of contracts with customers for which we grant customers access to our platform only for the duration of specific contracted events. Our Legacy revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time as events occur. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018, and substantially all subscription and other platform revenue associated with our Legacy offering ceased after December 2020.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue primarily consists of fees from customer agreements to provide consulting services, including experience management, monitoring and production services, implementation services and premium support services. The majority of our professional services consists of experience management and monitoring services, which are prepaid rights to a defined number of managed and monitored experiences. Professional services are generally considered distinct from the access provided to our platform. Professional services are available through hourly rate and fixed fee contracts, as well as one-time and ongoing engagements. We recognize revenue from experience management, monitoring and production services in the period the experience occurs and the services are delivered or, if they are not used by the customer, at the end of the subscription term. We recognize revenue from implementation services upon completion of the services. We recognize revenue from premium support offerings on a ratable basis over the subscription term. We expect our professional services revenue to increase as our customer base and use of our platform by existing customers increases, which may fluctuate from period to period. This fluctuation may include seasonality, with increased customer utilization of our platform in the fourth quarter and decreased utilization in the first quarter, reflecting the timing of our customers' marketing initiatives and their internal budget cycles.\nProfessional services revenue also contains revenue from our Legacy offering, which consists of event-related services, and is recognized when the event occurs. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all professional services revenue associated with our Legacy offering ceased after December 2020.\nCost of Revenue\nSubscription and Other Platform Cost of Revenue\nSubscription and other platform cost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our platform and providing operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, personnel-related costs such as salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, benefits costs associated with our operations and support personnel, software license fees and allocated overhead. We expect our subscription and other platform cost of revenue to increase in the near term in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to move to a hybrid cloud and otherwise expand our infrastructure and, over the long term, to increase in absolute dollars as our subscription revenue increases.\nSubscription and other platform cost of revenue also includes Legacy cost of revenue. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and the Legacy component of subscription and other platform cost of revenue substantially ceased after December 2020 consistent with related revenue.\nProfessional Services Cost of Revenue\nProfessional services cost of revenue consists primarily of personnel-related costs, including salaries and bonuses, stock-based compensation, third-party consulting services and allocated overhead. We expect our professional services cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our professional services revenue increases.\nProfessional services cost of revenue also includes Legacy cost of revenue. We stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018 and substantially all of the Legacy component of professional services cost of revenue ceased after December 2020 consistent with related revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with our sales and marketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include promotional events to promote our brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, tradeshows and our annual user conference, software license expenses and allocated overhead. Sales commissions that are directly related to acquiring customer contracts, as well as associated payroll taxes, are deferred upon execution of a contract with a customer, and subsequently amortized to sales and marketing expense. Sales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years, as we specifically anticipate renewals of the customer contracts and commissions paid on renewal contracts are not commensurate with commissions paid on new customer contracts. Sales commissions paid upon renewal of customer contracts are amortized over the contractual renewal term. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. Sales commissions paid related to professional services are amortized over the expected service period. We plan to increase our investment in sales and marketing over the foreseeable future, primarily through increased headcount in our sales and marketing functions and investment in brand- and product marketing efforts. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in the near term. However, we expect such expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time as our revenue grows, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period depending on fluctuations in the timing and extent of our sales and marketing expenses.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation directly associated with our research and development employees, contractor costs related to third-party development and allocated overhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase the dollar amount of our investment in research and development for the foreseeable future as we focus on further developing our platform and infrastructure. As a result, we expect our research and development expenses will increase as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, salaries and benefits for our personnel in executive, finance, legal and human resources organizations. In addition, these expenses include external legal costs, accounting and other consulting services, bad debt expense and allocated overhead.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we increase the size of our general and administrative function to support the growth of our business. In addition, as a public company, we expect to incur increased expenses in the areas of insurance, investor relations and professional services. As a result, we expect the absolute dollar amount of our general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future. We expect, however, that our general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of our revenue over time, although the percentage may fluctuate from period to period.\nOther Gains from Operations\nOther gains from operations consists of a one-time gain from a legal settlement.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense incurred on our Revolving Credit Facility, and income earned on cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nOther (income) expense, net consists primarily of currency transaction gains or losses and miscellaneous non-operational income and expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business.\nResults of Operations\nWe manage and operate as one reportable segment. The discussion below summarize our results of operations for the periods presented, which we derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nRevenue\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription and other platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $67.8 million, or 76%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by an increase in digital experience platform revenue and partially offset by a decrease in Legacy revenue.\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Digital Experience Platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription and other platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 121,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 133%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total digital experience platform revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 154,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legacy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription and other platform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (4,887\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional service\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,403\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Legacy revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,290\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 67,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal digital experience platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $74.1 million, or 92%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in subscription and other platform revenue of $54.9 million and an increase in professional services revenue of $19.2 million mainly due to increases in our customer base, as well as the increase in use of our platform by our existing customers, which reflects an increase in demand for our experience management and monitoring services.\nTotal legacy revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $6.3 million, or 75%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily attributable to a decrease in subscription and other Legacy platform revenue as we stopped selling our Legacy offering to new customers in 2018.

The increase in total digital experience platform cost of revenue was primarily driven by an increase in personnel-related expenses of $4.5 million due to increased headcount to support our platform and deliver services, a $1.9 million increase in bandwidth, transmission and software costs due to the expansion of infrastructure and data centers, and a $1.5 million increase in contractor costs and consulting service fees.\nTotal legacy cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $2.4 million, or 62%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.
