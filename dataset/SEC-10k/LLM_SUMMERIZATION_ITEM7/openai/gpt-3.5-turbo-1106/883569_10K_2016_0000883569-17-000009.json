Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSummary\nWe are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.\nDomestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon, Best Buy, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the U.S., our network of Company-owned stores included 94 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 129 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our website, www.fossil.com, as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites.\nInternationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in approximately 150 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 80 independent distributors. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 230 retail stores and 132 outlet stores as of December 31, 2016. Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries.\nOur consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands.\nOur business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers' control.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation liabilities and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the result would have been an approximate $2.6 million change to net income, net of taxes.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of market or average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in selling, general, and administrative expenses of approximately $2.8 million, $7.7 million and $9.3 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of approximately $13.5 million and $3.4 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. An increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate used in our impairment testing would not have resulted in additional impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $0.2 million. We recorded non-impairment restructuring charges related to the write off of property, plant and equipment of approximately $1.5 million in fiscal year 2016.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. Additionally, if events or conditions were to indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable, we would evaluate goodwill for impairment at that time. We have three reporting units for which we evaluate goodwill for impairment: Americas, Europe and Asia. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information and discounted cash flows. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment charge is recorded. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value by over 25%.\nWe evaluate indefinite-lived trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 21% of our total trade name balances at the end of fiscal year 2016, 19% at the end of fiscal year 2015 and 22% at the end of fiscal year 2014. The SKAGEN trade name represented approximately 63% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016, 65% at the end of fiscal year 2015 and 77% at the end of fiscal year 2014. We performed\nthe required annual impairment test and recorded no impairment charges in fiscal year 2016 related to the SKAGEN or MICHELE trade names. In fiscal year 2015, $9.1 million in impairment charges were recorded related to the SKAGEN trade name, and no impairment charges were recorded related to the MICHELE trade name. No trade name impairment charges were recorded in fiscal year 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name approximated its carrying value, and the fair value of the SKAGEN trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%.\nWe acquired the MISFIT trade name on December 22, 2015. The MISFIT trade name represented approximately 15% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016 and 17% at the end of fiscal year 2015. The MISFIT trade name is being amortized over its remaining useful life of 6 years. We monitor finite-lived trade names for events or conditions that indicate the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ, which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit's fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill and trade names may be incurred.\nIncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits (\"uncertain tax positions\"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.\nWarranty Costs. Our watch products are covered by limited warranties against defects in materials or workmanship. Historically, our FOSSIL and RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. have been covered for warranty periods of 11 years and 12 years, respectively, and our SKAGEN branded watches have been covered by a lifetime warranty. Beginning in 2017, these brands will be moving to a two year warranty. Generally, all other products sold in the U.S. and internationally are covered by a comparable one to two year warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The year-end warranty liability for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $15.4 million, $13.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively.\nHedge Accounting. The Company is exposed to certain market risks relating to foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company actively monitors and attempts to manage these exposures using derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts (\"forward contracts\") and interest rate swaps. The Company's main objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risks primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in other income (expense) - net in the period which the intercompany cash payment for inventory is made. Additionally, to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the cash flows being hedged, any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts would be recognized in other income (expense) - net on the Company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Also, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert portions of its variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in interest expense in the period in which the payment is settled. To reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates adversely affecting the Company's investment in foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries, the Company periodically enters into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses from net investment hedges are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income (loss), and will be reclassified into earnings in the event the Company's underlying investments are liquidated or disposed. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, for these hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation. We utilize the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (i) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options and stock appreciation rights before exercising them (\"expected term\"), (ii) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and (iii) the number of stock options and stock appreciation rights that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. If the fair value of our stock-based compensation were to change by 10%, the result would have been a $2.3 million change to net income.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nDuring fiscal year 2016, net sales decreased 6% (4% in constant currency) as compared to the prior fiscal year as we continued to face headwinds, particularly in the traditional watch market. During fiscal 2016, net sales in the Americas and Europe segments declined while Asia grew. However, sales trends improved sequentially during the year in all segments, mainly driven by the wearables category. Despite a challenging backdrop and persistent volatility for much of the retail industry, our team remained focused on our strategic priorities and advanced many of the initiatives that we believe will enable us to drive growth and improve our financial performance in the future. We were able to deliver constant currency growth in fiscal 2016 in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, despite the challenging retail environment. Fiscal 2016 was a year that Fossil Group demonstrated its ability to move at a rapid pace to adjust to consumer demands. In one short year, we acquired Misfit, integrated their team into the organization and leveraged their technology platform across our portfolio of brands, launching over 100 SKUs of wearables in 8 brands, 40 countries and 20 different languages. Across display smart watches, hybrid smart watches and activity trackers, we were able to give the customer the new functionality in beautiful, stylish, and branded products and these products had a strong positive impact on our business.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, FOSSIL branded products were flat (increased 2% in constant currency), including modest growth in watches offset by sales declines in all other product categories. In addition, our SKAGEN branded products increased 8% (9% in constant currency), representing growth across all three major product categories and driven by watches. Our FOSSIL and SKAGEN watch performance was favorably impacted by wearables, including the expansion of Fossil Q product and the launch of Skagen Connected styles. We remain committed to further growing these brands and believe such growth is a key component to our long-term goal of creating a healthy balance between owned and licensed brands. Developing and growing brands today means doing so in a digital-age across e-commerce platforms, mobile platforms and social media channels. Having invested in our omni-channel capabilities over the last several years, launching new branded websites and improving the customer experience on our e-commerce platforms, these investments are supporting our growth initiatives. FOSSIL and SKAGEN are succeeding by offering compelling products with unique functionality supported by clearly communicated brand stories that we can bring to the customer, wherever they choose to shop.\nThe following table presents as reported and constant currency net sales percentage change information by brand for the fiscal year 2016 as compared to the fiscal year 2015:\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth Percentage\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Brand\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>FOSSIL\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>SKAGEN\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur multi-brand global watch portfolio decreased 6% (4% in constant currency) during fiscal year 2016. We experienced strong sales growth in TORY BURCH and KATE SPADE NEW YORK watches, which was offset by sales declines in most other licensed brands in our multi-brand watch portfolio. The wholesale channel continues to be challenging, particularly in the traditional watch market, although we are always in the pursuit of ways to grow our core business. Today, we believe that trend is technology and having added a technology platform to our competitive strengths, we believe we are in a position to continue to attract the best brands to our portfolio as well as grow our existing brands beyond their current levels. During fiscal year 2016, the watch portfolio benefited from the launch of MICHAEL KORS ACCESS, a new line of wearables which was supported by a strong marketing campaign from the brand. Although MICHAEL KORS watches declined for fiscal year 2016, we experienced marked improvement with the launch of their smart watches in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. Considering both our positive FOSSIL and MICHAEL KORS connected sales results and the improved sell through rates for these brands, we believe evidence supports our theory that technology can be the catalyst to drive growth in the watch category.\nDuring fiscal 2016, global comparable store sales declined 5% year-over-year. Positive comparable store sales results in Asia were offset by a modest decline in the Americas while Europe was flat.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we began working on a new multi-year restructuring plan, focused on our growth opportunities, including connected accessories, and improving overall profitability. While it is early in the process, we envision a comprehensive plan that will evolve our model and the way we work, the way we develop product and the way we bring our products to market. We expect the program will touch all aspects of our business as we enhance our operational capabilities, gain greater efficiencies and take optimal advantage of our considerable scale. Our scale should enable us to improve our product costs in wearables and fine tune our price points to be ultra-competitive in the category. We will review and adjust our overall structure with the goal of streamlining the way we work to respond to the changing needs and demands of our customers. We believe the new operating structure will create opportunities to leverage as we drive growth. In fiscal year 2016, we started examining and adjusting our store fleet to reflect the evolving shopping habits of today's consumer and will continue to do so. Our goal is to, over time, improve our financial performance and build an improved operating platform that is nimble and responsive and will be in a position to drive long term shareholder value.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, gross profit decreased as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily resulting from decreased sales and a lower gross margin rate driven by increased promotional activity in the outlet channel, an increased mix of lower margin product and an increased mix of off-price sales. Additionally, the gross margin rate included an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 70 basis points. Partially offsetting these margin headwinds were our margin improvement initiatives.\nOur operating margin contracted during fiscal year 2016, primarily due to lower sales and gross margin rate. During fiscal year 2016, operating expenses decreased due to lower store and core infrastructure costs and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with wearables infrastructure and the Misfit acquisition. During fiscal year 2016, our financial performance, including the unfavorable impacts of currencies, resulted in earnings of $1.63 per diluted share.\nConstant Currency Financial Information\nAs a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business.\nAs a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nConsolidated Net Sales. Net sales decreased $186.4 million or 5.8%, (4.4% in constant currency ) for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015. Global watch sales decreased $145.5 million or 5.9% (4.5% in constant currency) as a result of increases in our owned brands FOSSIL and SKAGEN and licensed brands KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH, being more than offset by declines in most other brands in our portfolio. Our leathers business decreased $15.6 million or 3.8% (2.5% in constant currency). Our jewelry category decreased $20.7 million or 7.6% (5.9% in constant currency), mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL branded products during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nNet sales information by product category is summarized on a reported and constant currency basis as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td>

During fiscal year 2016, we experienced the most significant retail headwinds in the Americas segment. Americas net sales decreased $137.0 million or 8.2% (7.5% in constant currency), driven by watches but with jewelry and leathers contributing to the declines as well. During fiscal year 2016, our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $100.6 million or 8.0% (7.1% in constant currency) and our leathers category decreased $21.9 million or 8.1% (7.7% in constant currency). Our Americas watch sales decline during fiscal year 2016 was primarily driven by MICHAEL KORS and partially offset by increases in KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH. Our jewelry business decreased $8.1 million or 8.1% (7.7% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by declines in MICHAEL KORS jewelry partially offset by increases from the MISFIT brand. Within the region, sales declined in the U.S. and were slightly offset by growth in Mexico and Canada on a constant currency basis. Comparable retail store sales decreased modestly in our owned retail stores, most notably in our outlets.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth (Decline)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage as Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,162.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(100.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers\n</td> <td>247.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>269.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry\n</td> <td>91.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,524.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,661.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(137.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope Net Sales.

During fiscal year 2017, we anticipate opening approximately 15 additional retail stores and closing approximately 40 stores globally.\nA store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation. Stores that experience a gross square footage increase of 10% or more due to an expansion and/or relocation are removed from the comparable store sales base, but are included in total sales. These stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the expansion and/or relocation. Comparable store sales also exclude the effects of foreign currency fluctuations.\nGross Profit. Gross profit of $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2016 decreased 10.0% in comparison to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2015 mainly as a result of decreased sales. Gross profit margin decreased 240 basis points to 51.9% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 54.3% in the prior fiscal year. The gross margin rate decreased as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to increased promotional activity in our outlet stores and an increased mix of connected product sales. Additionally, our wholesale channel was burdened by an increased mix of off-price sales at lower margin rates and the impacts of currency decreased our gross profit margin rate by 70 basis points. Partially offsetting these headwinds were the favorable impacts of our margin improvement initiatives.\nOperating Expenses. For fiscal year 2016, total operating expenses decreased by $11.2 million and as a percentage of net sales, increased to 47.7% compared to 45.3% in fiscal year 2015. Operating expenses decreased due to lower store and core infrastructure costs, a $14.9 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency, the non-recurrence of both the SKAGEN trade name impairment and Misfit acquisition-related professional services recorded in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with wearables infrastructure and Misfit intangible amortization.\nConsolidated Operating Income. Operating income decreased by $164.1 million, or 56.4%, in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year mainly driven by decreased sales and gross margin rate and included a $31.7 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currencies. As a percentage of net sales, operating income decreased to 4.2% in fiscal year 2016 as compared to 9.0% in fiscal year 2015 and was negatively impacted by approximately 90 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies.\nSales and gross profit margins were negatively impacted by currencies in all regional segments in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year, although not as extensively as in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014. On a constant currency basis, sales and gross profit margins decreased in the Americas and Europe and increased in Asia while the gross profit margin rate decreased across all segments. The gross margin rate declined primarily as a result of promotional activity in our outlet stores and an increased mix of connected product sales in all geographies. Additionally, the Americas gross profit margin rate was unfavorably impacted by an increased mix of sales in the wholesale off-price channel to manage inventory levels. These unfavorable impacts to the gross profit margin rate were partially offset by a favorable impact from our margin improvement initiatives in all segments. In fiscal year 2016, total operating expenses decreased compared to fiscal year 2015 as reduced store expenses and lower core infrastructure costs were partially offset by corporate cost increases in wearables infrastructure and Misfit purchase accounting related costs. Our operating expenses in fiscal year 2016 also benefited from real estate sales in the Americas and Europe. During fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, operating expense leverage was relatively flat in Europe and improved in Asia while weakening in the Americas largely due to fixed expenses on lower sales and increased restructuring costs related to store closures.\nOperating income by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth (Decline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Margin %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>241.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(113.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>174.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>210.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>77.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(365.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(345.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(164.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $6.9 million in fiscal year 2016 as a result of increased interest rates in comparison to the prior fiscal year.\nOther Income (Expense)-Net. During fiscal year 2016, other income (expense) - net decreased by approximately $26.4 million, largely driven by decreased net foreign currency gains resulting from cash flow hedging and other transactional activities as compared to fiscal year 2015. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 other income (expense) - net amount included a $5.2 million gain related to an interest rate hedge settlement related to a potential debt issuance which did not occur. Fiscal year 2016 includes a gain of $3.5 million for the liquidation of some non-operating Misfit assets, which partially offset our unfavorable other income (expense) - net change.\nProvision for Income Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2016 was $28.7 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 25.1%, compared to 26.2% in fiscal year 2015. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015 was mostly attributable to lower U.S. taxable income taxed at higher effective tax rates.\nNet Income Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2016 net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was $1.63 per diluted share in comparison to $4.51 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year, mainly driven by the sales decline and reduced margin rate. Diluted earnings per share decreased $0.87 due to the translation impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and less net foreign currency gains resulting from cash flow hedging and other transactional activities. Diluted earnings per share was also unfavorably impacted by a $0.37 per diluted share decrease due to the amortization of acquired Misfit intangible assets and of related contingent equity grants. An increase in interest expense negatively impacted our diluted earnings per share by $0.11 due to increased interest rates. Partially offsetting these decreases were a $0.16 favorable impact to diluted earnings per share due to the sale of real estate.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nThe Company's fiscal year periodically results in a 53-week year instead of a normal 52-week year. Fiscal year 2014 was a 53-week year, with the additional week included in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Accordingly, the information presented herein includes 53 weeks of operations for fiscal year 2014 as compared to 52 weeks in fiscal year 2015. In the following discussion, certain amounts are presented on a comparable calendar basis by removing an estimated week of activity from fiscal year 2014.\nConsolidated Net Sales. Net sales decreased $280.9 million or 8.0% (0.8% in constant currency and comparable calendar) for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014. Global watch sales decreased $260.7 million or 9.5% (2.7% in constant currency and comparable calendar) while our leathers business decreased $10.0 million or 2.4% (increased 4.8% in constant currency and comparable calendar). Our jewelry category decreased $4.4 million or 1.6% (increased 8.9% in constant currency and comparable calendar), as a result of a decrease in sales of FOSSIL branded products, partially offset by a

Americas net sales decreased $85.6 million or 4.9% (2.0% in constant currency and comparable calendar), during fiscal year 2015, driven by watches partially offset by increases in jewelry and leathers on a constant currency and comparable calendar basis. During fiscal year 2015 our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $89.3 million or 6.6% (3.8% in constant currency and comparable calendar) and our leathers category decreased $0.4 million or 0.1% (increased 3.0% in constant currency and comparable calendar). Excluding MICHAEL KORS, our Americas watch sales increased during fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the benefit from the addition of KATE SPADE NEW YORK to our licensed brands in the first half of fiscal year 2015. Our jewelry business increased $8.3 million or 9.1% (12.4% in constant currency and comparable calendar) in fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year driven by increased licensed jewelry sales. Within the region, growth in Canada across the retail and wholesale channels and in our Mexico wholesale business was more than offset by declines in both the wholesale and retail channels in the U.S. Our U.S. wholesale business declined largely driven by a weaker performance in U.S. department stores where traffic continues to be a challenge and softer trends in the business persist. Comparable retail store sales increased slightly in our owned retail stores (normalized for the 53-week calendar) as improved conversion rates offset a decline in traffic.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency and comparable calendar basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions):\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth (Decline)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage as Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency and Comparable Calendar\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,262.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,352.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(89.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers\n</td> <td>269.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>270.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry\n</td> <td>99.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,661.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,747.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(85.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEurope Net Sales.

The following table presents our business segment and product net sales on a constant currency and comparable calendar basis. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for fiscal year 2015 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during fiscal year 2014. To calculate net sales on a comparable calendar basis, we have estimated the impact on net sales of the extra week in fiscal year 2014. Our presentations of net sales on a constant currency and comparable calendar basis are non-GAAP financial measures. We present net sales on a constant currency and comparable calendar basis because we believe that such information is useful to certain investors as a measure of our results of operations year-over-year without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations and the extra week in fiscal year 2014.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Impact of Extra Week\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Comparable Calendar\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,475.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(153.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,628.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,736.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,702.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leathers\n</td> <td>409.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>433.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>419.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>413.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jewelry\n</td> <td>272.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>297.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>273.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>71.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>77.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,228.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(207.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,436.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,509.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,465.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Constant Currency\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Impact of Extra Week\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Comparable Calendar\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,661.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,691.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,747.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,725.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>1,069.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,207.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,195.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,180.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>497.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>537.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>566.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>558.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,228.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(207.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,436.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,509.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,465.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStores.

Gross profit of $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2015 decreased 12.4% in comparison to $2.0 billion in fiscal year 2014 as a result of decreased sales and changes in foreign currencies. Gross profit margin decreased 270 basis points to 54.3% in fiscal year 2015 compared to 57.0% in the prior fiscal year. The gross margin rate decreased as compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily driven by changes in foreign currencies, which unfavorably impacted gross profit margin by approximately 290 basis points. Excluding the impacts of currency, the gross margin rate expanded mainly due to the favorable impacts of our pricing initiatives, lower product costs and our regional distribution mix given the growth in international markets which more than offset the impact of higher markdowns, increased effectiveness of promotional activity in our retail channel, primarily in our outlet stores and clearance activities including increased levels of off-price sales.\nOperating Expenses. For fiscal year 2015, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 45.3% in fiscal year 2015 compared to 40.9% in fiscal year 2014 and included a $96.0 million favorable impact from the translation of foreign-based expenses into U.S. dollars. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses for fiscal year 2015 increased by $123.6 million primarily as a result of our increased marketing and strategic investments, increased store expenses, restructuring charges and increased incentive compensation, partially offset by the additional week of operations included in the prior year. Additionally fiscal year 2015 included a $9.1 million non-cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of our SKAGEN trade name, largely driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and fewer planned store openings as compared to original valuation assumptions, and $8.4 million in costs related to the Misfit acquisition.\nConsolidated Operating Income. Operating income decreased by $275.3 million, or 48.6%, in fiscal year 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year and included a $115.8 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currencies. As a percentage of net sales, operating income decreased to 9.0% in fiscal year 2015 as compared to 16.1% in fiscal year 2014 and was negatively impacted by approximately 280 basis points due to changes in foreign currencies, as well as continued investments in our strategic initiatives to drive future growth. During fiscal year 2015, sales and gross profit margins were negatively impacted by currencies in all regional segments as compared to the prior fiscal year. On a constant currency and comparable calendar basis, sales grew in Europe and decreased in the Americas and Asia, while gross profit margin grew in both Europe and Asia and decreased in the Americas. During fiscal year 2015, gross profit margin in all regions was negatively impacted by clearance activities and the Americas gross profit margin was further impacted by an increased mix of sales in the off-price channel. These unfavorable impacts to gross profit margin were partially offset by favorable impacts from our pricing initiatives in all regions and an increased sales mix of higher margin products within the watch category in the Asia segment. During fiscal year 2015, operating expenses deleveraged in all regions largely due to fixed expenses on lower sales. Additionally, the Americas and Europe segments included restructuring charges and increased marketing and customer engagement costs. Corporate operating expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased compared to fiscal year 2014, largely driven by investments in advertising and strategic initiatives, restructuring charges, a noncash impairment charge, closing costs associated with the Misfit acquisition and increased incentive compensation.\nOperating income by operating segment is summarized as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth (Decline)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Operating Margin %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Americas\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>354.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>463.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>210.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asia\n</td> <td>71.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>116.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate\n</td> <td>(345.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(301.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>566.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(275.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $4.1 million in fiscal year 2015 as a result of increased debt levels in comparison to the prior fiscal year.\nOther Income (Expense)-Net. During fiscal year 2015, other income (expense) - net increased by approximately $33.0 million, largely driven by increased net foreign currency gains resulting from mark-to-market hedging and other transactional activities as compared to fiscal year 2014. Additionally, the fiscal year 2015 other income (expense) - net amount included a $5.2 million gain related to an interest rate hedge settlement while the fiscal year 2014 other income (expense) - net amount included an arbitration judgment gain of $6.0 million related to the purchase price for Skagen Designs.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense for fiscal year 2015 was $81.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 26.2%, compared to 30.7% in fiscal year 2014. The lower effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 as compared to fiscal year 2014 was\nattributable to foreign tax credits generated from the repatriation of foreign earnings, favorable adjustments to the prior year income tax accruals, and the recognition of income tax benefits due to the settlement of audits.\nNet Income Attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. Fiscal year 2015 net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. was $4.51 per diluted share in comparison to $7.10 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year and included a $1.12 per diluted share decrease related to foreign currency changes. Excluding currency impacts, diluted earnings per share included a $0.35 per diluted share decrease related to restructuring charges, a $0.13 per diluted share decrease from a non-cash impairment charge and a $0.12 per diluted share decrease for Misfit transaction costs, offset by a $0.35 per diluted share benefit from a reduction in average shares outstanding and a $0.28 per diluted share increase associated with lower taxes. Net income attributable to Fossil Group, Inc. decreased 41.4% to $220.6 million for fiscal year 2015 in comparison to $376.7 million in the prior year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our business operations have not required substantial cash during the first several months of our fiscal year. Generally, starting in the third quarter, our cash needs begin to increase, typically reaching a peak in the September-November time frame as we increase inventory levels in advance of the holiday season. Our quarterly cash requirements are also impacted by the number of new stores we open, other capital expenditures and strategic investments such as acquisitions. Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of fiscal year 2016 was $297.3 million, including $283.6 million held by foreign subsidiaries outside the U.S., in comparison to $289.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2015.\nFor fiscal year 2016, we generated operating cash flow of $210.1 million. This operating cash flow combined with cash on hand and funds generated from real estate sales was utilized to fund $171.4 million in net repayments on our credit facilities and $65.7 million in capital expenditures. During fiscal year 2016, net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net income of $85.6 million adjusted by non-cash activities of $107.2 million and a net decrease of $17.3 million in working capital items.\nAccounts receivable increased by 1.3% to $375.5 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to $370.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Average days sales outstanding for our wholesale business for fiscal year 2016 remained relatively flat at 50 days compared to 49 days in the prior fiscal year.\nInventory at the end of fiscal year 2016 was $542.5 million, representing a decrease of 13.2% from the prior fiscal year inventory balance of $625.3 million.\nThe following tables reflect our common stock repurchase activity under our repurchase programs for the periods indicated (in millions):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the 2016 Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the 2015 Fiscal Year\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal Year\nAuthorized\n</td> <td>Dollar Value\nAuthorized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Termination Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nShares\nRepurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Value\nRepurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nShares\nRepurchased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar Value\nRepurchased\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2014\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>200.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2012\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 2016 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2010\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>None\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________\n(1) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, the Company completed this repurchase plan.\nWe effectively retired 0.1 million shares of repurchased common stock under our repurchase programs during fiscal year 2016. We account for the retirements by allocating the repurchase price, which is based upon the equity contribution associated with historical issuances, to common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The effective retirement of common stock repurchased during fiscal year 2016 decreased common stock by $1,100, additional paid-in capital by $0.2 million, retained earnings by $5.0 million and treasury stock by $5.2 million. The effective retirement of common stock repurchased during the 2015 fiscal year decreased common stock by $27,300, additional paid-in capital by $0.7 million, retained earnings by $228.8 million and treasury stock by $229.5 million. At January 2, 2016 and December 31, 2016, all treasury stock had been effectively retired. We are currently prohibited by the terms of our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) from repurchasing additional shares of common stock.\nAt the end of the fiscal year 2016, we had working capital of $932.7 million compared to working capital of $953.1 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. Additionally, at the end of the fiscal year 2016, we had approximately $26.4 million of outstanding short-term borrowings and $610.0 million in long-term debt.\nOn March 9, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for (i) revolving credit loans in the amount of $1.05 billion (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), with an up to $20.0 million subfacility for swingline loans (the Swingline Loan\u201d), and an up to $10.0 million subfacility for letters of credit, and (ii) a term loan in the amount of $231.3 million (the Term Loan\u201d). The Credit Agreement expires and is due and payable on May 17, 2018. The Credit Agreement amended and restated that certain credit agreement, dated as of May 17, 2013, as amended (the Prior Agreement\u201d).\nOn August 8, 2016, we entered into the First Amendment. The First Amendment adds two new levels to the applicable margin pricing grid used to calculate the interest rate that is applicable to base rate loans and LIBOR rate loans under the credit facility and increases the applicable margin at each pricing level for LIBOR rate loans by 25 basis points and for base rate loans by 25 basis points. Additionally, the First Amendment provides for the net cash proceeds from certain debt issuances in excess of $25.0 million to be applied, first, to prepay the term loans under our credit facility and, for the excess, if any, to prepay the\nrevolving credit loans under our credit facility with a corresponding reduction in the revolving credit commitment by the amount of such excess proceeds. Furthermore, the First Amendment changes the consolidated total leverage ratio that we must comply with for fiscal quarters ending on or after June 30, 2016 from 2.50:1.00 to 3.25:1.00.\nIn connection with the First Amendment, we, along with certain of our material domestic subsidiaries, entered into a Collateral Agreement in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, pursuant to which, together with such subsidiaries, we granted liens on all or substantially all of their assets in order to secure our obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other loan documents (the Obligations\u201d). Additionally, certain of our domestic subsidiaries entered into a Guaranty Agreement in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, pursuant to which such subsidiaries guarantee the payment and performance of the Obligations.\nAs of August 8, 2016, amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at (i) the base rate (defined as the highest of (a) the prime rate publicly announced by Wells Fargo, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% and (c) London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") for an interest period of one month plus 1.0%) plus the base rate applicable margin (which varies, based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio, from 0.50%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00, to 1.75%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00) or (ii) the LIBOR rate (defined as the quotient obtained by dividing (a) LIBOR by (b) 1.00 minus the Eurodollar reserve percentage) plus the LIBOR rate applicable margin (which varies, based upon the consolidated total leverage ratio, from 1.50%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is less than 1.00 to 1.00, to 2.75%, if the consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00).\nAmounts outstanding under the Swingline Loan under the Credit Agreement or upon any drawing under a letter of credit bear interest at the base rate plus the applicable margin. Interest based upon the base rate is payable quarterly in arrears. Interest based upon the LIBOR rate is payable on the last day of the applicable interest period.\nFinancial covenants in the Credit Agreement require us to maintain (i) a consolidated total leverage ratio no greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and (ii) a consolidated interest coverage ratio no less than 3.50 to 1.00.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we made net principal payments of $21.9 million under the Term Loan. During fiscal year 2016, we had net principal payments of $148.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility at an average interest rate of 2.33%. As of December 31, 2016, we had $189.9 million and $441.0 million outstanding under the Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. The outstanding balance under the Term Loan is net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.8 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, we had $0.9 million of outstanding standby letters of credit at December 31, 2016. Amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility are reduced by any amounts outstanding under standby letters of credit. As of December 31, 2016, we had $303.9 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was favorably impacted by a $200.0 million international cash balance. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were mainly used to fund capital expenditures, normal operating expenses and historical common stock repurchases. At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to all our credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we do not consider $310.2 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested. As such, we have accrued taxes on these amounts net of applicable foreign tax credits. We have not provided for U.S. federal and state income taxes on the remaining $959.0 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The determination of the amount of incremental tax that would be due in the event these earnings are repatriated in the future is not practicable. However, our intent is to keep these funds indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and our current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nFor the fiscal year ending December 30, 2017, we expect total capital expenditures to be approximately $70 million. Of this amount, we expect approximately 70% will be for strategic growth, including investments in omni-channel, global concessions and technology, approximately 15% will be for retail store expansion and renovation and approximately 15% will be for technology and facilities maintenance. Our capital expenditure budget and allocation of it to the foregoing investments are estimates and are subject to change. We believe that cash flows from operations combined with existing cash on hand and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next twelve months.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table identifies our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>609,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on debt (2)\n</td> <td>31,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum royalty payments (3)\n</td> <td>239,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>160,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,174\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>5,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,072\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>799,857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>233,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (5)\n</td> <td>442,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions (6)\n</td> <td>3,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations (7)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,157,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>746,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>994,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Consists of borrowings in the U.S., excluding contractual interest payments and unamortized debt issuance costs of $3.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Consists of estimated interest payments under the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Consists primarily of minimum royalty commitments under exclusive licenses to manufacture watches and jewelry under trademarks not owned by us.

products are not seasonal in nature, a significant portion of our net sales and operating income is generally derived in the second half of the fiscal year. Our third and fourth quarters, which include the \"back to school\" and Christmas seasons, have historically generated a significant portion of our annual operating income. The amount of net sales and operating income generated during the first quarter is affected by the levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season, as well as general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. In general, lower levels of inventory held by retailers at the end of the Christmas season may have a positive impact on our net sales and operating income in the first quarter of the following fiscal year as a result of higher levels of restocking orders placed by retailers.\nAs we expand our e-commerce business and improve productivity in our retail store base, sales from the direct to consumer distribution channel may increase as a percentage of the total sales mix. Based upon the historical seasonality of direct to consumer sales, we believe this expansion could result in higher levels of profitability in the fourth quarter and lower levels of profitability in the first and second quarters when, due to seasonality, it is more difficult to leverage retail store four wall operating costs and back office expenses against a lower level of sales productivity. In addition, new product launches would generally augment the sales and operating expense levels in the quarter the product launch takes place. The results of operations for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of factors, including retail, economic and monetary conditions, timing of orders or holidays, the timing of investments and the mix of products sold by us.", "summary": "The report is a Management's Discussion and Analysis of a global design, marketing, and distribution company specializing in consumer fashion accessories.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSummary\nWe are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.\nDomestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon, Best Buy, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the U.S., our network of Company-owned stores included 94 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 129 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our website, www.fossil.com, as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites.\nInternationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in approximately 150 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 80 independent distributors. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 230 retail stores and 132 outlet stores as of December 31, 2016. Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries.\nOur consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands.\nOur business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers' control.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation liabilities and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the result would have been an approximate $2.6 million change to net income, net of taxes.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of market or average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in selling, general, and administrative expenses of approximately $2.8 million, $7.7 million and $9.3 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of approximately $13.5 million and $3.4 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. An increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate used in our impairment testing would not have resulted in additional impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $0.2 million. We recorded non-impairment restructuring charges related to the write off of property, plant and equipment of approximately $1.5 million in fiscal year 2016.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. Additionally, if events or conditions were to indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable, we would evaluate goodwill for impairment at that time. We have three reporting units for which we evaluate goodwill for impairment: Americas, Europe and Asia. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information and discounted cash flows. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment charge is recorded. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value by over 25%.\nWe evaluate indefinite-lived trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 21% of our total trade name balances at the end of fiscal year 2016, 19% at the end of fiscal year 2015 and 22% at the end of fiscal year 2014. The SKAGEN trade name represented approximately 63% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016, 65% at the end of fiscal year 2015 and 77% at the end of fiscal year 2014. We performed\nthe required annual impairment test and recorded no impairment charges in fiscal year 2016 related to the SKAGEN or MICHELE trade names. In fiscal year 2015, $9.1 million in impairment charges were recorded related to the SKAGEN trade name, and no impairment charges were recorded related to the MICHELE trade name. No trade name impairment charges were recorded in fiscal year 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name approximated its carrying value, and the fair value of the SKAGEN trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%.\nWe acquired the MISFIT trade name on December 22, 2015. The MISFIT trade name represented approximately 15% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016 and 17% at the end of fiscal year 2015. The MISFIT trade name is being amortized over its remaining useful life of 6 years. We monitor finite-lived trade names for events or conditions that indicate the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ, which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit's fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill and trade names may be incurred.\nIncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits (\"uncertain tax positions\"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.\nWarranty Costs. Our watch products are covered by limited warranties against defects in materials or workmanship. Historically, our FOSSIL and RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. have been covered for warranty periods of 11 years and 12 years, respectively, and our SKAGEN branded watches have been covered by a lifetime warranty. Beginning in 2017, these brands will be moving to a two year warranty. Generally, all other products sold in the U.S. and internationally are covered by a comparable one to two year warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The year-end warranty liability for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $15.4 million, $13.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively.\nHedge Accounting. The Company is exposed to certain market risks relating to foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company actively monitors and attempts to manage these exposures using derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts (\"forward contracts\") and interest rate swaps. The Company's main objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risks primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in other income (expense) - net in the period which the intercompany cash payment for inventory is made. Additionally, to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the cash flows being hedged, any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts would be recognized in other income (expense) - net on the Company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Also, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert portions of its variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in interest expense in the period in which the payment is settled. To reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates adversely affecting the Company's investment in foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries, the Company periodically enters into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses from net investment hedges are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income (loss), and will be reclassified into earnings in the event the Company's underlying investments are liquidated or disposed. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, for these hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation. We utilize the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (i) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options and stock appreciation rights before exercising them (\"expected term\"), (ii) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and (iii) the number of stock options and stock appreciation rights that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. If the fair value of our stock-based compensation were to change by 10%, the result would have been a $2.3 million change to net income.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nDuring fiscal year 2016, net sales decreased 6% (4% in constant currency) as compared to the prior fiscal year as we continued to face headwinds, particularly in the traditional watch market. During fiscal 2016, net sales in the Americas and Europe segments declined while Asia grew. However, sales trends improved sequentially during the year in all segments, mainly driven by the wearables category. Despite a challenging backdrop and persistent volatility for much of the retail industry, our team remained focused on our strategic priorities and advanced many of the initiatives that we believe will enable us to drive growth and improve our financial performance in the future. We were able to deliver constant currency growth in fiscal 2016 in our own brands, FOSSIL and SKAGEN, despite the challenging retail environment. Fiscal 2016 was a year that Fossil Group demonstrated its ability to move at a rapid pace to adjust to consumer demands. In one short year, we acquired Misfit, integrated their team into the organization and leveraged their technology platform across our portfolio of brands, launching over 100 SKUs of wearables in 8 brands, 40 countries and 20 different languages. Across display smart watches, hybrid smart watches and activity trackers, we were able to give the customer the new functionality in beautiful, stylish, and branded products and these products had a strong positive impact on our business.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, FOSSIL branded products were flat (increased 2% in constant currency), including modest growth in watches offset by sales declines in all other product categories. In addition, our SKAGEN branded products increased 8% (9% in constant currency), representing growth across all three major product categories and driven by watches. Our FOSSIL and SKAGEN watch performance was favorably impacted by wearables, including the expansion of Fossil Q product and the launch of Skagen Connected styles. We remain committed to further growing these brands and believe such growth is a key component to our long-term goal of creating a healthy balance between owned and licensed brands. Developing and growing brands today means doing so in a digital-age across e-commerce platforms, mobile platforms and social media channels. Having invested in our omni-channel capabilities over the last several years, launching new branded websites and improving the customer experience on our e-commerce platforms, these investments are supporting our growth initiatives. FOSSIL and SKAGEN are succeeding by offering compelling products with unique functionality supported by clearly communicated brand stories that we can bring to the customer, wherever they choose to shop.\nThe following table presents as reported and constant currency net sales percentage change information by brand for the fiscal year 2016 as compared to the fiscal year 2015:\n\nOur multi-brand global watch portfolio decreased 6% (4% in constant currency) during fiscal year 2016. We experienced strong sales growth in TORY BURCH and KATE SPADE NEW YORK watches, which was offset by sales declines in most other licensed brands in our multi-brand watch portfolio. The wholesale channel continues to be challenging, particularly in the traditional watch market, although we are always in the pursuit of ways to grow our core business. Today, we believe that trend is technology and having added a technology platform to our competitive strengths, we believe we are in a position to continue to attract the best brands to our portfolio as well as grow our existing brands beyond their current levels. During fiscal year 2016, the watch portfolio benefited from the launch of MICHAEL KORS ACCESS, a new line of wearables which was supported by a strong marketing campaign from the brand. Although MICHAEL KORS watches declined for fiscal year 2016, we experienced marked improvement with the launch of their smart watches in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016. Considering both our positive FOSSIL and MICHAEL KORS connected sales results and the improved sell through rates for these brands, we believe evidence supports our theory that technology can be the catalyst to drive growth in the watch category.\nDuring fiscal 2016, global comparable store sales declined 5% year-over-year. Positive comparable store sales results in Asia were offset by a modest decline in the Americas while Europe was flat.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we began working on a new multi-year restructuring plan, focused on our growth opportunities, including connected accessories, and improving overall profitability. While it is early in the process, we envision a comprehensive plan that will evolve our model and the way we work, the way we develop product and the way we bring our products to market. We expect the program will touch all aspects of our business as we enhance our operational capabilities, gain greater efficiencies and take optimal advantage of our considerable scale. Our scale should enable us to improve our product costs in wearables and fine tune our price points to be ultra-competitive in the category. We will review and adjust our overall structure with the goal of streamlining the way we work to respond to the changing needs and demands of our customers. We believe the new operating structure will create opportunities to leverage as we drive growth. In fiscal year 2016, we started examining and adjusting our store fleet to reflect the evolving shopping habits of today's consumer and will continue to do so. Our goal is to, over time, improve our financial performance and build an improved operating platform that is nimble and responsive and will be in a position to drive long term shareholder value.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, gross profit decreased as compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily resulting from decreased sales and a lower gross margin rate driven by increased promotional activity in the outlet channel, an increased mix of lower margin product and an increased mix of off-price sales. Additionally, the gross margin rate included an unfavorable currency impact of approximately 70 basis points. Partially offsetting these margin headwinds were our margin improvement initiatives.\nOur operating margin contracted during fiscal year 2016, primarily due to lower sales and gross margin rate. During fiscal year 2016, operating expenses decreased due to lower store and core infrastructure costs and the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency, partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with wearables infrastructure and the Misfit acquisition. During fiscal year 2016, our financial performance, including the unfavorable impacts of currencies, resulted in earnings of $1.63 per diluted share.\nConstant Currency Financial Information\nAs a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The translation of the operations of our foreign-based entities from their local currencies into U.S. dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and can have a significant impact on our reported financial results. In general, our overall financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business.\nAs a result, in addition to presenting financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), our discussion contains references to constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate net sales on a constant currency basis, net sales for the current year for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average rates during the comparable period of the prior fiscal year. We present constant currency information to provide investors with a basis to evaluate how our underlying business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The constant currency financial information presented herein should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations between constant currency financial information and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included where applicable.\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nConsolidated Net Sales. Net sales decreased $186.4 million or 5.8%, (4.4% in constant currency ) for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015. Global watch sales decreased $145.5 million or 5.9% (4.5% in constant currency) as a result of increases in our owned brands FOSSIL and SKAGEN and licensed brands KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH, being more than offset by declines in most other brands in our portfolio. Our leathers business decreased $15.6 million or 3.8% (2.5% in constant currency). Our jewelry category decreased $20.7 million or 7.6% (5.9% in constant currency), mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL branded products during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nNet sales information by product category is summarized on a reported and constant currency basis as follows (dollars in millions):\n\nThe following table sets forth consolidated net sales by segment on a reported and constant currency basis (dollars in millions):\n\nAmericas Net Sales. During fiscal year 2016, we experienced the most significant retail headwinds in the Americas segment. Americas net sales decreased $137.0 million or 8.2% (7.5% in constant currency), driven by watches but with jewelry and leathers contributing to the declines as well. During fiscal year 2016, our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $100.6 million or 8.0% (7.1% in constant currency) and our leathers category decreased $21.9 million or 8.1% (7.7% in constant currency). Our Americas watch sales decline during fiscal year 2016 was primarily driven by MICHAEL KORS and partially offset by increases in KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH. Our jewelry business decreased $8.1 million or 8.1% (7.7% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by declines in MICHAEL KORS jewelry partially offset by increases from the MISFIT brand. Within the region, sales declined in the U.S. and were slightly offset by growth in Mexico and Canada on a constant currency basis. Comparable retail store sales decreased modestly in our owned retail stores, most notably in our outlets.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions):\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nSummary\nWe are a global design, marketing and distribution company that specializes in consumer fashion accessories. Our principal offerings include an extensive line of men's and women's fashion watches and jewelry, handbags, small leather goods, belts, and sunglasses. In the watch and jewelry product categories, we have a diverse portfolio of globally recognized owned and licensed brand names under which our products are marketed. Our products are distributed globally through various distribution channels including wholesale in countries where we have a physical presence, direct to the consumer through our retail stores and commercial websites and through third-party distributors in countries where we do not maintain a physical presence. Our products are offered at varying price points to meet the needs of our customers, whether they are value-conscious or luxury oriented. Based on our extensive range of accessory products, brands, distribution channels and price points, we are able to target style-conscious consumers across a wide age spectrum on a global basis.\nDomestically, we sell our products through a diversified distribution network that includes department stores, specialty retail locations, specialty watch and jewelry stores, Company-owned retail and outlet stores, mass market stores and through our FOSSIL website. Our wholesale customer base includes, among others, Amazon, Best Buy, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Target and Wal-Mart. In the U.S., our network of Company-owned stores included 94 retail stores located in premier retail sites and 129 outlet stores located in major outlet malls as of December 31, 2016. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our website, www.fossil.com, as well as proprietary and licensed watch and jewelry brands through other managed and affiliated websites.\nInternationally, our products are sold to department stores, specialty retail stores and specialty watch and jewelry stores in approximately 150 countries worldwide through 23 Company-owned foreign sales subsidiaries and through a network of approximately 80 independent distributors. Internationally, our network of Company-owned stores included 230 retail stores and 132 outlet stores as of December 31, 2016. Our products are also sold through licensed and franchised FOSSIL retail stores, retail concessions operated by us and kiosks in certain international markets. In addition, we offer an extensive collection of our FOSSIL brand products on our websites in certain countries.\nOur consolidated gross profit margin is impacted by our diversified business model that includes but is not limited to: (i) a significant number of product categories we distribute, (ii) the multiple brands we offer within several product categories, (iii) the geographical presence of our businesses and (iv) the different distribution channels we sell to or through. The components of this diversified business model produce varying ranges of gross profit margin. Generally, on a historical basis, our fashion branded watch and jewelry offerings produce higher gross profit margins than our leather goods offerings. In addition, in most product categories that we offer, brands with higher retail price points generally produce higher gross profit margins compared to those of lower retail priced brands. Gross profit margins related to sales in our Europe and Asia businesses are historically higher than our Americas business primarily due to the following factors: (i) premiums charged in comparison to retail prices on products sold in the U.S.; (ii) the product sales mix in our international businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, is comprised more predominantly of watches and jewelry that generally produce higher gross profit margins than leather goods; and (iii) the watch sales mix in our Europe and Asia businesses, in comparison to our Americas business, are comprised more predominantly of higher priced licensed brands.\nOur business is subject to the risks inherent in global sourcing supply. Certain key components in our products come from limited sources of supply, which exposes us to potential supply shortages that could disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products. Any interruption or delay in the supply of key components could significantly harm our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and cause us to lose sales. Interruptions or delays in supply may be caused by a number of factors that are outside of our and our contractor manufacturers' control.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included therewith.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product returns, bad debt, inventories, long-lived asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and trade names, income taxes, warranty costs, hedge accounting, litigation liabilities and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant estimates and judgments.\nProduct Returns. We accept limited returns and may request that a customer return a product if we feel the customer has an excess of any style that we have identified as being a poor performer for that customer or geographic location. We monitor returns and maintain a provision for estimated returns based upon historical experience and any specific issues identified. While returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, future return rates may differ from those experienced in the past. In the event that our products are performing poorly in the retail market and/or we experience product damages or defects at a rate significantly higher than our historical rate, the resulting returns could have an adverse impact on the operating results for the period or periods in which such returns occur. If our allowance for product returns were to change by 10%, the result would have been an approximate $2.6 million change to net income, net of taxes.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of market or average cost, including any applicable duty and freight charges. We account for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the average cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand, market conditions and available liquidation channels. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if liquidation channels are not readily available, additional inventory valuation reductions may be required. We assess our off-price sales on an ongoing basis and update our estimates accordingly. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment. We test for asset impairment of property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows related to the asset. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we calculate fair value using our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. When undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated through the operations of our Company-owned retail stores are less than the carrying value of the underlying assets, the assets are impaired. If it is determined that assets are impaired, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount the asset's book value exceeds its fair value. Should actual results or market conditions differ from those anticipated, additional losses may be recorded. We recorded impairment losses in selling, general, and administrative expenses of approximately $2.8 million, $7.7 million and $9.3 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recorded impairment losses in restructuring charges of approximately $13.5 million and $3.4 million in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. An increase of 100 basis points to the discount rate used in our impairment testing would not have resulted in additional impairment expense. A 10% decrease in future expected cash flows would have increased impairment expense by $0.2 million. We recorded non-impairment restructuring charges related to the write off of property, plant and equipment of approximately $1.5 million in fiscal year 2016.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Trade Names. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of the end of the fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its recorded value. Additionally, if events or conditions were to indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable, we would evaluate goodwill for impairment at that time. We have three reporting units for which we evaluate goodwill for impairment: Americas, Europe and Asia. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using market comparable information and discounted cash flows. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no impairment charge is recorded. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value by over 25%.\nWe evaluate indefinite-lived trade names by comparing the fair value of the asset to its recorded value annually as of the end of the fiscal year and whenever events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of the trade name may not be recoverable. The fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies. The MICHELE trade name represented approximately 21% of our total trade name balances at the end of fiscal year 2016, 19% at the end of fiscal year 2015 and 22% at the end of fiscal year 2014. The SKAGEN trade name represented approximately 63% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016, 65% at the end of fiscal year 2015 and 77% at the end of fiscal year 2014. We performed\nthe required annual impairment test and recorded no impairment charges in fiscal year 2016 related to the SKAGEN or MICHELE trade names. In fiscal year 2015, $9.1 million in impairment charges were recorded related to the SKAGEN trade name, and no impairment charges were recorded related to the MICHELE trade name. No trade name impairment charges were recorded in fiscal year 2014. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the MICHELE trade name approximated its carrying value, and the fair value of the SKAGEN trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5%.\nWe acquired the MISFIT trade name on December 22, 2015. The MISFIT trade name represented approximately 15% of our total trade name balance at the end of fiscal year 2016 and 17% at the end of fiscal year 2015. The MISFIT trade name is being amortized over its remaining useful life of 6 years. We monitor finite-lived trade names for events or conditions that indicate the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making the estimates and assumptions used in the fair value analysis, actual results may differ, which could alter the fair value of the trade names and possibly cause impairment charges to occur in future periods.\nJudgments and assumptions are inherent in our estimate of future cash flows used to determine the estimate of the reporting unit's fair value. The most significant assumptions associated with the fair value calculations include net sales growth rates and discount rates. If the actual future sales results do not meet the assumed growth rates, future impairments of goodwill and trade names may be incurred.\nIncome Taxes. We record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary, in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (\"ASC 740\"). Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset, increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made. In addition, we have not recorded U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.\nOur continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. We accrue an amount for our estimate of additional income tax liability which we believe we are more likely than not to incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits (\"uncertain tax positions\"). We review and update the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities, upon completion of tax audits, upon expiration of statutes of limitation, or upon occurrence of other events. The results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits.\nWarranty Costs. Our watch products are covered by limited warranties against defects in materials or workmanship. Historically, our FOSSIL and RELIC watch products sold in the U.S. have been covered for warranty periods of 11 years and 12 years, respectively, and our SKAGEN branded watches have been covered by a lifetime warranty. Beginning in 2017, these brands will be moving to a two year warranty. Generally, all other products sold in the U.S. and internationally are covered by a comparable one to two year warranty. We determine our warranty liability using historical warranty repair experience. As changes occur in sales volumes and warranty experience, the warranty accrual is adjusted as necessary. The year-end warranty liability for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $15.4 million, $13.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively.\nHedge Accounting. The Company is exposed to certain market risks relating to foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The Company actively monitors and attempts to manage these exposures using derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward contracts (\"forward contracts\") and interest rate swaps. The Company's main objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risks primarily associated with certain anticipated inventory purchases. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in other income (expense) - net in the period which the intercompany cash payment for inventory is made. Additionally, to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the cash flows being hedged, any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts would be recognized in other income (expense) - net on the Company's consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Also, the Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert portions of its variable rate debt obligations to fixed rates. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders' equity, and are recognized in interest expense in the period in which the payment is settled. To reduce exposure to changes in currency exchange rates adversely affecting the Company's investment in foreign currency-denominated subsidiaries, the Company periodically enters into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses from net investment hedges are recognized in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income (loss), and will be reclassified into earnings in the event the Company's underlying investments are liquidated or disposed. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial\ninstruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules as required by ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, for these hedges.\nStock-Based Compensation. We utilize the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights on the date of grant. The model requires us to make assumptions concerning (i) the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options and stock appreciation rights before exercising them (\"expected term\"), (ii) the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and (iii) the number of stock options and stock appreciation rights that will be forfeited. Changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and, consequently, the related expense amounts recognized on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. If the fair value of our stock-based compensation were to change by 10%, the result would have been a $2.3 million change to net income.\nResults of Operations\nExecutive Summary\nDuring fiscal year 2016, net sales decreased 6% (4% in constant currency) as compared to the prior fiscal year as we continued to face headwinds, particularly in the traditional watch market.

Net sales decreased $186.4 million or 5.8%, (4.4% in constant currency ) for fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015. Global watch sales decreased $145.5 million or 5.9% (4.5% in constant currency) as a result of increases in our owned brands FOSSIL and SKAGEN and licensed brands KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH, being more than offset by declines in most other brands in our portfolio. Our leathers business decreased $15.6 million or 3.8% (2.5% in constant currency). Our jewelry category decreased $20.7 million or 7.6% (5.9% in constant currency), mostly as a result of a decrease in sales of MICHAEL KORS and FOSSIL branded products during fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal year 2015.\nNet sales information by product category is summarized on a reported and constant currency basis as follows (dollars in millions):\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td>

During fiscal year 2016, we experienced the most significant retail headwinds in the Americas segment. Americas net sales decreased $137.0 million or 8.2% (7.5% in constant currency), driven by watches but with jewelry and leathers contributing to the declines as well. During fiscal year 2016, our multi-brand watch portfolio decreased $100.6 million or 8.0% (7.1% in constant currency) and our leathers category decreased $21.9 million or 8.1% (7.7% in constant currency). Our Americas watch sales decline during fiscal year 2016 was primarily driven by MICHAEL KORS and partially offset by increases in KATE SPADE NEW YORK and TORY BURCH. Our jewelry business decreased $8.1 million or 8.1% (7.7% in constant currency) in fiscal year 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by declines in MICHAEL KORS jewelry partially offset by increases from the MISFIT brand. Within the region, sales declined in the U.S. and were slightly offset by growth in Mexico and Canada on a constant currency basis. Comparable retail store sales decreased modestly in our owned retail stores, most notably in our outlets.\nThe following table sets forth product net sales for the Americas segment on a reported and constant currency basis by fiscal year (dollars in millions):\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Growth (Decline)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage as Reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage Constant Currency\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollars\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Watches\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,162.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
