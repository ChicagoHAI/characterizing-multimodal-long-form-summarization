(the Company\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Limestone Bank, Inc. (the Bank\u201d). The Company is a Louisville, Kentucky-based bank holding company that operates banking offices in twelve Kentucky counties. Our markets include metropolitan Louisville in Jefferson County and the surrounding counties of Henry and Bullitt. The Bank serves south central Kentucky and southern Kentucky from banking offices in Butler, Green, Hart, Edmonson, Barren, Warren, Ohio, and Daviess Counties. The Bank also has an office in Lexington, the second largest city in Kentucky. The Bank is a community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products.\nHistorically, the Bank has focused on commercial and commercial real estate lending, both in markets where we have banking offices and other growing markets in our region. Commercial, commercial real estate and real estate construction loans accounted for 60.9% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, and 58.4% as of December 31, 2017. Commercial lending generally produces higher yields than residential lending, but involves greater risk and requires more rigorous underwriting standards and credit quality monitoring.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other schedules presented elsewhere in the report.\nOverview\nNet income before taxes was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Income tax expense was $2.0 million for 2018 and income tax benefit was $31.9 million for 2017 due to the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $8.8 million compared with net income of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After allocating earnings to participating securities, net income attributable to common shareholders was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted income per common share were $1.23 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net income per common share of $6.15 for 2017, and net loss per common share of ($0.46) for 2016.\nThe following significant items are of note for the year ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Average loans receivable increased approximately $75.9 million or 11.4% to $743.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $667.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loan interest income benefited with an increase in interest revenue volume of approximately $3.8 million and interest rate increases of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the year ended December 31, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.53% for the year ended 2018 compared with 3.48% in the year ended December 31, 2017.

The negative provision was attributable to net loan recoveries, declining historical loss rates, improvements in loan quality, and management's assessment of risk in the loan portfolio. Net loan recoveries were $1.2 million for 2018, compared to net loan recoveries of $35,000 for 2017 and net loan charge-offs of $624,000 for 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Nonaccrual loans decreased $3.5 million to $2.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $5.5 million at December 31, 2017.

Management believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of management assumptions and judgments that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance using, among other things, historical loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions and trends. The allowance may be allocated for specific loans or loan categories, but the entire allowance is available for any loan. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually evaluated and measured for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative environmental factors. Management develops allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends. Allowance estimates are a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio applied to individual loans based on loan type. If the mix and amount of future charge-off percentages differ significantly from the assumptions used by management in making its determination, management may be required to materially increase its allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses, which could adversely affect results.\nOther Real Estate Owned - OREO is real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. It is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. OREO is recorded at its fair market value less estimated cost to sell. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred in order to perfect the lien prior to foreclosure may be capitalized if the fair value less the cost to sell exceeds the balance of the loan at the time of transfer to OREO. Examples of eligible costs to be capitalized are payments of delinquent property taxes to clear tax liens or payments to contractors and subcontractors to clear mechanics' liens. Fair value of OREO is determined on an individual property basis. To determine the fair value of OREO for smaller dollar single family homes, management consults with staff from the Bank's special assets group as well as external realtors and appraisers. If the internally evaluated market price is below the underlying investment in the property, appropriate write-downs are taken. For larger dollar residential and commercial real estate properties, management obtains a new appraisal of the subject property or has staff from our special assets group evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to OREO. Management generally obtains updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent. When an asking price is lowered below the most recent appraised value, appropriate write-downs are taken.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred tax liabilities ( DTLs\u201d) and assets ( DTAs\u201d) are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. A DTL or DTA is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward (used) in future years. The valuation of current and deferred income tax liabilities and assets is considered critical, as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws. The assessment of tax liabilities and assets involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes.\nThere can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings. The Company believes its tax assets and liabilities are adequate and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2018 compared with 2017:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change from Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (negative provision) for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(500 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(800 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sale of securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(294 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102.1 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,641 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income before taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,899 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,659 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM: Not Meaningful\nNet income of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $29.7 million from net income of $38.5 million for 2017. Net income for 2017 was impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $31.9 million for 2017. During 2018, improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories continued. A negative provision for loan losses expense of $500,000 was recorded during 2018, compared to $800,000 negative provision for loan losses expense for 2017. Non-interest income increased $669,000 during 2018. There was an increase of $310,000 in bank card interchange fees, $232,000 in other non-interest income, and $102,000 in service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest expense decreased $1.6 million during 2018 due primarily to decreases in OREO expense of $1.1 million and FDIC insurance of $855,000 offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $399,000.\nThe following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2017 compared with 2016:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change from Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (negative provision) for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(800 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,450 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sale of securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,254 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.1 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,732 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,899 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,920 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,753 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM: Not Meaningful\nNet income of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $41.2 million from a net loss of $2.8 million for 2016. During the period, improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories continued. In addition, net income for 2017 was impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The net result of these two items, as well as income tax expense for the year, was an income tax benefit of $31.9 million for 2017. A negative provision for loan losses expense of $800,000 was recorded during 2017, compared to $2.5 million negative provision for loan losses expense for 2016. Non-interest income increased $114,000 during 2017. There was an increase of $295,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, $218,000 in bank card interchange fees, and $62,000 in other non-interest income which was offset by no OREO income during 2017, compared to $456,000 during 2016. Non-interest expense decreased $9.3 million during 2017 due primarily to a decrease in litigation and loan collection expense of $8.6 million as 2016 was negatively impacted by a ruling from the Kentucky Court of Appeals against the Bank that approximated $8.0 million. After consideration of earnings attributable to participating securities, net income attributable to common shareholders was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for 2016.\nNet Interest Income - Net interest income was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, compared with $31.1 million for the same period in 2017. Net interest spread and margin were 3.32% and 3.53%, respectively, for 2018, compared with 3.35% and 3.48%, respectively, for 2017. Average nonaccrual loans were $3.5 million and $7.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAverage interest-earning assets were $957.5 million for 2018, compared with $904.1 million for 2017, a 5.9% increase, primarily attributable to higher average loans, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities. Average loans were $743.4 million for 2018, compared with $667.5 million for 2017, an 11.4% increase. Average investment securities were $178.9 million for 2018, compared with $193.1 million for 2017, a 7.3% decrease. Average interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and fed funds sold were $27.9 million in 2018, compared with $36.2 million in 2017, a 22.8% decrease. Total interest income increased 15.8% to $43.5 million for 2018, compared with $37.5 million for 2017.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by 3.3% to $799.0 million for 2018, compared with $773.2 million for 2017. Total interest expense increased by 52.8% to $9.8 million for 2018, compared with $6.4 million during 2017, due primarily to increases in rates paid on certificates of deposits and other time deposits as well as increases in average balances of FHLB advances in 2018 compared to 2017. Average volume of certificates of deposit decreased 2.8% to $439.6 million for 2018, compared with $452.4 million for 2017. The average interest rate paid on certificates of deposit increased to 1.35% for 2018, compared with 0.93% for 2017. Average volume of interest checking and money market deposit accounts increased 0.9% to $249.4 million for 2018, compared with $247.3 million for 2017. The average interest rate paid on interest checking and money market deposit accounts increased to 0.62% for 2018, compared with 0.38% for 2017. Both the yield on earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities were impacted by increases in short-term interest rates during 2017 and 2018.\nNet interest income was $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.5 million, or 5.1%, compared with $29.6 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest spread and margin were 3.35% and 3.48%, respectively, for 2017, compared with 3.32% and 3.42%, respectively, for 2016.

Average loans were $667.5 million for 2017, compared with $621.3 million for 2016, a 7.4% increase. Average investment securities were $193.1 million for 2017, compared with $183.7 million for 2016, a 5.1% increase. Average interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and fed funds sold were $36.2 million in 2017, compared with $62.9 million in 2016, a 42.4% decrease. Total interest income increased 5.4% to $37.5 million for 2017, compared with $35.6 million for 2016.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by 1.7% to $773.2 million for 2017, compared with $760.7 million for 2016. Total interest expense increased by 7.1% to $6.4 million for 2017, compared with $6.0 million during 2016, due primarily to the completion of a $10.0 million senior debt transaction during 2017 as well as an increase in FHLB advances outstanding during 2017. Average volume of certificates of deposit decreased 2.9% to $452.4 million for 2017, compared with $466.0 million for 2016. The average interest rate paid on certificates of deposit increased to 0.93% for 2017, compared with 0.88% for 2016.

This increase was primarily attributable to a $310,000 increase in bank card interchange fees, a $232,000 increase in other non-interest income, and a $102,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts partially offset by a $6,000 net loss on sale of securities for 2018 compared to a $288,000 net gain during 2017.\nThe $232,000 net increase in other non-interest income for 2018 includes a $150,000 third quarter gain on sale of the Bank's secondary market residential mortgage servicing rights portfolio, as well as a $632,000 fourth quarter gain on sale of a subdivided lot at the Company's headquarters, partially offset by a $392,000 fourth quarter impairment charge associated with the transfer of the Bank's data processing center to Premises Held for Sale.\nIn December 2018, the Bank completed a core system conversion, which Management believes will provide opportunities for work flow efficiencies and improvements in customer experience. In connection with the completion of the core systems conversion, Management approved the closure of its central data processing facility. Support services personnel will be relocated from the bank-owned data processing facility to other nearby facilities in 2019. In December 2018, the data processing facility was transferred to Premises Held For Sale at fair value, as determined by an independent third party appraisal, less estimated cost to sell. The transfer to held for sale resulted in the $392,000 impairment charge noted above, which is included in other non-interest income. Upon sale of the facility, Management expects to realize annual occupancy expense savings of approximately $200,000.\nNon-interest income increased by $186,000 in 2017 to $5.4 million compared with $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to a $295,000 increase in service charges on deposit accounts, a $218,000 increase in bank card interchange fees, and a $72,000 increase in net gain on sale of securities partially offset by no OREO income during 2017, compared to $456,000 during 2016.\nNon-interest Expense - The following table presents the major categories of non-interest expense:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salary and employee benefits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,517 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FDIC insurance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,412 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data processing expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,185 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketing expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,098 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>973 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State franchise and deposit tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>965 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deposit account related expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Communications\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>706 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Insurance expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>565 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Postage and delivery\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Litigation and loan collection expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other real estate owned expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,541 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,852 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,882 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $29.1 million represented a 3.1% decrease from $30.8 million for 2017. The decrease in non-interest expense was attributable primarily to a decrease in OREO expense of $1.1 million. Non-interest expense also benefited from a $855,000 decrease in FDIC insurance as a result of the Bank's improved risk profile, partially offset by a $399,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits. As shown below, expenses related to OREO decreased due to lower valuation adjustment write-downs during 2018 compared to 2017.\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(72 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation adjustment write-downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,963 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,973 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, fair value write-downs of $850,000 were recorded compared with $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The 2018 write-downs reflect declines in the fair value due to changes in marketing strategies and new appraisals. OREO sales totaled $876,000 and $793,000 during 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-interest Expense Comparison - 2017 to 2016\nNon-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $30.8 million represented a 23.1% decrease from $40.0 million for 2016. The decrease in non-interest expense was attributable primarily to a decrease in litigation and loan collection expense, which decreased $8.6 million. Litigation expense was negatively impacted in 2016 by a ruling from the Kentucky Court of Appeals against the Bank that approximated $8.0 million. Non-interest expense also benefited from a $590,000 decrease in professional fees, a $418,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, and a $248,000 decrease in FDIC insurance. As shown below, expenses related to OREO trended higher due to higher valuation adjustment write-downs during 2017 compared to 2016.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(74 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(222 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation adjustment write-downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>583 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,541 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, fair value write-downs totaled $2.0 million compared with $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, management concluded it was more-likely-than-not the asset would be utilized to reduce future taxes payable related to the future taxable income of the Company, and as such, reversed the valuation allowance. As a result of the conclusion to reverse the valuation allowance, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $54.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law. Among other significant changes to the tax code, the new law lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. As a result, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset at the new 21% rate for 2017. Due to this revaluation, the Company recorded a $20.3 million charge to income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe combination of the reversal of the valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates, as well as income tax expense for the year, resulted in an income tax benefit of $31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSee Note 11, Income Taxes\u201d, for additional discussion of our income taxes.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nTotal assets at December 31, 2018 were $1.07 billion compared with $970.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $98.9 million or 10.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loans of $52.5 million as well as an increase in securities available for sale of $48.5 million.\nTotal assets at December 31, 2017 were $970.8 million compared with $945.2 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $25.6 million or 2.7%. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net loans of $73.6 million as well as the restoration of a net deferred tax asset of $31.3 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of $41.9 million as well as a $30.9 million decrease in interest bearing deposits in banks.\nLoans Receivable - Loans receivable increased $53.1 million, or 7.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2018, to $765.2 million.

This represents a $274,000 increase in loans past due 30-89 days. This trend in delinquency levels is considered during the evaluation of qualitative trends in the portfolio when establishing the general component of our allowance for loan losses.\nNonaccrual loans decreased $3.5 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by $3.6 million in paydowns, $293,000 in charge-offs, $730,000 in transfers to OREO, and $77,000 in loans returned to accrual status, offset by $1.2 million in loans placed on non-accrual. The $2.0 million in nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018, and $5.5 million at December 31, 2017, were generally secured by farmland and 1-4 family residential real estate loans. Management believes it has established adequate loan loss reserves for these credits.\nTroubled Debt Restructuring - A troubled debt restructuring (TDR) occurs when the Bank has agreed to a loan modification in the form of a concession to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty. The Bank's TDRs typically involve a reduction in interest rate, a deferral of principal for a stated period of time, or an interest only period. All TDRs are considered impaired, and the Bank has allocated reserves for these loans to reflect the present value of the concessionary terms granted to the borrower. If the loan is considered collateral dependent, it is reported net of allocated reserves, at the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell.\nThe Bank does not have a formal loan modification program. If a borrower is unable to make contractual payments, management reviews the particular circumstances of that borrower's situation and determine whether or not to negotiate a revised payment stream. The goal when restructuring a credit is to afford the borrower a reasonable period of time to remedy the issue causing cash flow constraints so that the credit may return to performing status over time. If a borrower fails to perform under the modified terms, the loan(s) are placed on nonaccrual status and collection actions are initiated.\nManagement periodically reviews renewals and modifications of previously identified TDRs for which there was no principal forgiveness, to consider if it is appropriate to remove the TDR classification. If the borrower is no longer experiencing financial difficulty and the renewal/modification did not contain a concessionary interest rate or other concessionary terms, management considers the potential removal of the TDR classification. If deemed appropriate based upon current underwriting, the TDR classification is removed as the borrower has complied with the terms of the loan at the date of renewal/modification and there was a reasonable expectation that the borrower would continue to comply with the terms of the loan after the date of the renewal/modification. Additionally, the TDR classification may be removed in circumstances in which the Company performs a non-concessionary re-modification of the loan at terms that were considered to be at market for loans with comparable risk. Management expects the borrower will continue to perform under the re-modified terms based on the borrower's past performance.\nIf the borrower fails to perform, management places the loan on nonaccrual status and seeks to liquidate the underlying collateral. The nonaccrual policy for restructured loans is identical to the nonaccrual policy for all loans. The policy calls for a loan to be reported as nonaccrual if it is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, payment in full of principal and interest is not expected, or principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the assets are both well secured and in the process of collection. Changes in value for impairment, including the amount attributed to the passage of time, are recorded entirely within the provision for loan losses. Upon determination that a loan is collateral dependent, the loan is charged down to the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell.\nAt December 31, 2018, the Bank had two restructured loans totaling $910,000 with borrowers who experienced deterioration in financial condition compared with six restructured loans totaling $3.0 million at December 31, 2017. In general, these loans were granted interest rate reductions to provide cash flow relief to borrowers experiencing cash flow difficulties. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had no restructured loans that had been granted principal payment deferrals until maturity compared with two loans totaling approximately $1.8 million at December 31, 2017. There were no concessions made to forgive principal relative to these loans, although partial charge-offs have been recorded for certain restructured loans. In general, these loans are secured by first liens on 1-4 residential properties, commercial real estate properties, or farmland. At December 31, 2018 both TDRs were performing according to their modified terms, compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nThere were no modifications granted during 2018 or 2017 that resulted in loans being identified as TDRs. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, TDRs were reduced as a result of $1.5 million in payments and $500,000 due to the transfer of a loan to OREO. See Note 3 - Loans,\u201d to the financial statements for additional disclosure related to troubled debt restructuring.\nNon-Performing Assets - Non-performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated, loans past due 90 days or more still on accrual, loans on which interest is no longer accrued, real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets. Loans, including impaired loans, are placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection. Loans are considered impaired if full principal or interest payments are not anticipated in accordance with the contractual loan terms. Impaired loans are carried at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell if the loan is collateral dependent. Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and normal collection procedures are implemented when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan. If the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds 120 days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not agreed to with the borrower, management institutes measures to remedy the default, including commencing a foreclosure action. Consumer loans generally are charged off when a loan is deemed uncollectible and often before any available collateral has been disposed. Commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies are handled on an individual basis with the advice of legal counsel.\nInterest income on loans is recognized on the accrual basis except for those loans placed on nonaccrual status. The accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when management believes, after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrowers' financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful, which typically occurs after the loan becomes 90 days delinquent. When interest accrual is discontinued, existing accrued interest is reversed and interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received on well-secured loans.\nReal estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. New and used automobiles and other motor vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets until they are sold. When such property is acquired it is recorded at its fair market value less cost to sell. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent gains and losses are included in non-interest expense.\nThe following table sets forth information with respect to non-performing assets as of the dates indicated:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans on nonaccrual status\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,991 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,175 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Troubled debt restructurings on accrual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,985 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Past due 90 days or more still on accrual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing loans and TDRs on accrual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate acquired through foreclosure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,197 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other repossessed assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-performing assets and TDRs on accrual\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing loans and TDRs on accrual to total loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.94 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.28 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.09 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-performing assets and TDRs on accrual to total assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.14 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.26 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.35 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.35 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for non-performing loans\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,253 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for non-performing loans to non-performing loans and TDRs on accrual\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.86 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.62 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.65 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.94 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.81 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income that would have been earned on non-performing loans was $274,000, $465,000, and $738,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Interest income recognized on non-performing loans was $452,000, $135,000, and $445,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The allowance for loan losses is based on management's continuing review and evaluation of individual loans, loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various categories of loans and such other factors that, in management's judgment, require current recognition in estimating loan losses.\nManagement has established loan grading procedures that result in specific allowance allocations for any estimated inherent risk of loss. For loans not individually evaluated, a general allowance allocation is computed using factors developed over time based on actual loss experience. The specific and general allocations plus consideration of qualitative factors represent management's estimate of probable losses contained in the loan portfolio at the evaluation date. Although the allowance for loan losses is comprised of specific and general allocations, the entire allowance is available to absorb any credit losses.\nThe following table sets forth an analysis of

The allowance for loan losses is comprised of general reserves and specific reserves. The loan loss reserve, as a percentage of total loans at December 31, 2018, was stable at 1.16% and 1.15% at December 31, 2017. New loans continue to be underwritten with lower loss expectations. Historical loss experience, risk grade classification metrics, charge-off levels, and past due trends remained stable between periods. The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans was 306.10% at December 31, 2018, compared with 122.88% at December 31, 2017. Net recoveries totaled $1.2 million for 2018 compared to $35,000 for 2017.\nA general reserve is maintained for each loan type in the loan portfolio. In determining the amount of the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses, management considers factors such as our historical loan loss experience, the growth, composition and diversification of our loan portfolio, current delinquency levels, loan quality grades, the results of recent regulatory examinations and general economic conditions. Based on these factors, management applies estimated percentages to the various categories of loans, not including any loan that has a specific allowance allocated to it, based on our historical experience, portfolio trends and economic and industry trends. This information is used by management to set the general reserve portion of the allowance for loan losses at a level it deems prudent.\nGenerally, all loans identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific allowance is required. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Bank will not receive all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan has been identified as impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with ASC 310-10, Impairment of a Loan.\u201d When management's measured value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the amount of the impairment is recorded as a specific reserve or charged-off if the loan is deemed collateral dependent. These specific reserves are determined on an individual loan basis based on management's current evaluation of our loss exposure for each credit given the payment status, financial condition of the borrower and value of any underlying collateral. Loans for which specific reserves have been provided are excluded from the general reserve calculations described below. Changes in specific reserves from period to period are the result of changes in the circumstances of individual loans such as charge-offs, pay-offs, changes in collateral values or other factors.\nThe allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of the amount necessary to provide for probable losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business. Due to the uncertainty of risks in the loan portfolio, management's judgment of the amount of the allowance necessary to absorb loan losses is approximate. The allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and may be adjusted in response to a determination by the regulatory agencies as to its adequacy in comparison with peer institutions.\nManagement makes specific allowances for each impaired loan based on its type and risk classification as discussed above. At year-end 2018, the allowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans and TDRs on accrual increased to 306.10% from 122.88% at year-end 2017. It is important to look more closely at this ratio as a significant portion of impaired loans are collateral dependent and have been charged down to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less cost to sell. Please see the next table for comparison and disclosure of recorded investment less allocated allowance relative to the unpaid principal balance. Impaired loans have been assessed for collectability which considered, among other things, the borrower's ability to repay, the value of the underlying collateral, and other market conditions to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses.\nThe following table presents the unpaid principal balance, recorded investment and allocated allowance related to loans individually evaluated for impairment in the commercial real estate and residential real estate portfolios as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Commercial\nReal Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Residential\nReal Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Commercial\nReal Estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Residential\nReal Estate\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unpaid principal balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,421 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,456 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Prior charge-offs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,911 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,050 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,099 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,506 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded investment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,950 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allocated allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(168 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(206 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded investment, less allocated allowance\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,744 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Recorded investment, less allocated allowance/ Unpaid principal balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.62 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.16 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.66 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.62 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on prior charge-offs, the current recorded investments in loans individually evaluated for impairment in the commercial real estate and residential real estate segments of the portfolio are significantly below the unpaid principal balances of those loans. The recorded investment net of the allocated allowance was 19.62% and 64.16% of the unpaid principal balance in the commercial real estate and residential real estate segments, respectively, at December 31, 2018.\nA significant portion of the portfolio is comprised of loans secured by real estate. A decline in the value of the real estate serving as collateral for loans may impact our ability to collect those loans. In general, management obtains updated appraisals on property securing our loans when circumstances are warranted such as at the time of renewal or when market conditions have significantly changed. Management uses qualified licensed appraisers approved by our Board of Directors. These appraisers possess prerequisite certifications and knowledge of the local and regional marketplace.\nBased on its assessment of the loan portfolio, management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses to the Bank's Board of Directors, indicating any change in the allowance for loan losses since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance for loan losses.\nThis assessment is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as events change. The allowance for loan losses was stable as a percentage of loans outstanding at 1.16% at December 31, 2018 and 1.15% at December 31, 2017. New loans continue to be underwritten with lower loss expectations. Historical loss experience, risk grade classification metrics, charge-off levels, and past due trends remained stable between periods. The level of the allowance is based on estimates, and losses may ultimately vary from these estimates.\nThe Bank follows a loan grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. Through this loan grading process, an internally classified watch list is maintained which helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Loans categorized as watch list loans show warning elements where the present status exhibits one or more deficiencies that require attention in the short-term or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted. These loans do not have all of the characteristics of a classified loan (substandard or doubtful) but show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit. These loans are reviewed to assist in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.\nIn establishing the appropriate risk rating for specific assets, management considers, among other factors, the borrower's ability to repay, the borrower's repayment history, the current delinquency status, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, and the capacity and willingness of a guarantor to satisfy the obligation. As a result of this process, loans are categorized as special mention, substandard or doubtful.\nLoans classified as special mention\u201d do not have all of the characteristics of substandard or doubtful loans. They have one or more deficiencies that warrant special attention and which corrective action, such as accelerated collection practices, may remedy.\nLoans classified as substandard\u201d are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as a highly leveraged position, unfavorable financial ratios, uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the repayment of the debt as contractually agreed. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected.\nLoans classified as doubtful\u201d are those loans which have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable.\nSpecific reserves may be carried for accruing TDRs in compliance with restructured terms. Once a loan is deemed impaired or uncollectible as contractually agreed (other than performing TDRs), the loan is charged-off either partially or in-full against the allowance for loan losses, based upon the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or the fair value of collateral less estimated cost to sell with respect to collateral-based loans if collateral dependent.\nAs of December 31, 2018, $6.4 million of loans were classified as substandard, $113,000 classified as special mention and no loans classified as doubtful or loss. This compares with $13.2 million of loans classified as substandard, $164,000 classified as special mention and no loans classified as doubtful or loss as of December 31, 2017. The $6.8 million decrease in loans classified as substandard was primarily driven by $12.6 million in principal payments received, $730,000 in migration to OREO, $92,000 in loans upgraded from substandard, and $480,000 in charge-offs, offset by $7.1 million in loans moved to substandard during 2018. Substandard loans are primarily concentrated in the residential real estate portfolio. As of December 31, 2018, $266,000 of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to substandard loans. This compares to allocations of $418,000 in the allowance for loan losses related to substandard loans at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table depicts management's allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type. Allowance funding and allocation is based on management's current evaluation of risk in each category, economic conditions, past loss experience, loan volume, past due history and other factors. Since these factors and management's assumptions are subject to change, the allocation is not necessarily predictive of future portfolio performance. The allocation is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the categories in which future losses may occur. The total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of loans.\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

losses of $500,000 was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with a negative provision for loan losses of $800,000 for 2017 and a negative provision for loan losses of $2.5 million for 2016. The negative provision in 2018 was driven by declining historical loss rates, net recoveries for the year, improvements in asset quality, changes on the composition of the portfolio, and management's assessment of risk within the portfolio. Asset quality improvement is evidenced by, among other things, improvements in loan risk category migration. The pass category increased approximately $72.6 million, the watch category declined approximately $12.6 million, the special mention category declined approximately $51,000 and the substandard category declined approximately $6.8 million. Additionally, non-accrual loans decreased $3.5 million or 63.5% during 2018. Net recoveries were $1.2 million for 2018 compared to net recoveries of $35,000 in 2017 and net charge-offs of $624,000 in 2016. Management considers the size and volume of our portfolio as well as the credit quality of our loan portfolio based upon risk category classification when determining the loan loss provision for each period and the allowance for loan losses at period end.\nForeclosed Properties - Foreclosed properties at December 31, 2018 were $3.5 million compared with $4.4 million at December 31, 2017. See Note 5 - Other Real Estate Owned,\u201d to the financial statements. During 2018, the Bank acquired $730,000 of OREO properties and sold properties totaling approximately $876,000. Management values foreclosed properties at fair value less estimated cost to sell when acquired and expects to liquidate these properties to recover our investment in the due course of business.\nOREO is recorded at fair market value less estimated cost to sell at time of acquisition. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. When foreclosed properties are acquired, management obtains a new appraisal or has staff from the Bank's special assets group evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to OREO. Management typically obtains updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent. Subsequent reductions in fair value are recorded as non-interest expense when a new appraisal indicates a decline in value or in cases where a listing price is lowered below the appraisal amount.\nThe following table presents the major categories of OREO at the year-ends indicated:\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Real Estate:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Construction, land development, and other land\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,571 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Farmland\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential Real Estate:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 1-4 Family\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet activity relating to other real estate owned during the years indicated is as follows:\nTable 92: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OREO Activity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OREO as of January 1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,214 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate acquired\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>730 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation adjustment write-downs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(850 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,963 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,180 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on sale\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proceeds from sale of properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(876 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(793 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,708 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> OREO as of December 31\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet gain on sales, write-downs, and operating expenses for OREO totaled $868,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $2.0 million in 2017 and $1.5 million in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, fair value write-downs of $850,000 were recorded compared with $2.0 million for 2017 and $1.2 million for 2016. The write-downs recorded in each year reflect fair value write-downs due to updated appraisals, changes in marketing strategies, and reductions in listing prices for certain properties. OREO sales totaled $876,000, $793,000, and $12.7 million during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Management expects to resolve certain nonaccrual loans through the acquisition and sale of the underlying real estate collateral.\nInvestment Securities - The securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk. Investments are made in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, corporate bonds, collateralized loan obligations, certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks, bankers' acceptances and federal funds. The investment portfolio increased by $48.5 million, or 31.7%, to $201.2 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $152.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the carrying

were calculated on a tax equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of 21%. Mortgage-backed securities are securities that have been developed by pooling a number of real estate mortgages. These securities are issued by federal agencies such as Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as non-agency company issuers. These securities are deemed to have high credit ratings, and minimum regular monthly cash flows of principal and interest. Cash flows from agency backed mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the issuing agencies.\nUnlike U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities, which have a lump sum payment at maturity, mortgage-backed securities provide cash flows from regular principal and interest payments and principal prepayments throughout the lives of the securities. Mortgage-backed securities that are purchased at a premium will generally return decreasing net yields as interest rates drop because home owners tend to refinance their mortgages. Thus, the premium paid must be amortized over a shorter period. Therefore, those securities purchased at a discount will obtain higher net yields in a decreasing interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the opposite will generally be true. During a period of increasing interest rates, fixed rate mortgage-backed securities do not tend to experience heavy prepayments of principal and consequently, average life will not be shortened. If interest rates begin to fall, prepayments will generally increase. Non-agency issuer mortgage-backed securities do not carry a government guarantee. Management limits purchases of these securities to bank qualified issues with high credit ratings. At this time, there are no holdings of this type in the portfolio. At December 31, 2018, 80.7% of the Bank's agency mortgage-backed securities had contractual final maturities of more than ten years with a weighted average life of 20.5 years.\nThe Bank owns Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), which are debt securities secured by professionally managed portfolios of senior-secured loans to corporations. CLO managers are typically large non-bank financial institutions or banks and are typically $300 million to $1 billion in size, contain one hundred or more loans and have five to six credit tranches ranging from AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B and equity tranche. Interest and principal are paid first to the AAA tranche then to the next lower rated tranche. Losses are borne first by the equity tranche then by the subsequently higher rated tranche. CLOs may be less liquid than government securities from time to time and volatility in the CLO market may cause the value of these investments to decline.\nThe market value of CLOs may be affected by, among other things, changes in composition of the underlying loans, changes in the cash flows from the underlying loans, defaults and recoveries on the underlying loans, capital gains and losses on the underlying loans, and prepayments on the underlying loans. Although we attempt to mitigate the credit and liquidity risks associated with CLOs by purchasing CLOs with credit ratings of A or higher, completing pre-purchase due diligence, and through ongoing monitoring, no assurance can be given that these risk mitigation efforts will be successful.\nAt December 31, 2018, $33.1 million and $16.7 million of our CLOs were AA and A rated, respectively. There were no CLOs rated below A and none of the CLOs were subject to ratings downgrade in 2018. All of our CLOs are floating rate, with rates set on a quarterly basis at three month LIBOR plus a spread.\nDeposits - The Bank attracts both short-term and long-term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates. In recent years, the Bank has been required by market conditions to rely increasingly on short to mid-term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives, which are more responsive to market interest rates.\nThe Bank primarily relies on its banking office network to attract and retain deposits in its local markets and has in the past leveraged the online channel to attract out-of-market deposits. Market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits. During 2018, total deposits increased $47.2 million compared with 2017. During 2017, total deposits decreased $2.9 million compared with 2016. The increase in deposits for 2018 and 2017 was primarily in certificates of deposit balances as well as money market accounts.\nTo evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from continually changing conditions, management evaluates simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins along with other pertinent economic data. The Bank continues to offer attractively priced deposit products along its product line to allow it to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during various rising and falling interest rate cycles.\nThe Bank offers savings accounts, interest checking accounts, money market accounts and fixed rate certificates with varying maturities. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. Management adjusts interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties on the Bank's deposit products periodically. The variety of deposit products allows the Bank to compete more effectively in obtaining funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into outside investment alternatives. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the cost of these funds have been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by market conditions.\nThe following table sets forth the

mature.\nBorrowing - Deposits are the primary source of funds for lending and investment activities and for general business purposes. The Bank also uses advances (borrowings) from the FHLB of Cincinnati to supplement the pool of lendable funds, meet deposit withdrawal requirements and manage the terms of liabilities. Advances from the FHLB are secured by the Bank's stock in the FHLB, and substantially all of its first mortgage residential loans. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $46.5 million in advances outstanding from the FHLB and the capacity to increase borrowings by an additional $42.7 million. The FHLB of Cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and is authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages and other assets (principally, securities that are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States) provided that it meets certain standards related to creditworthiness.\nThe following table sets forth information about our FHLB advances as of and for the periods indicated:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average balance outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,184 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Maximum amount outstanding at any month-end during the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,630 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,830 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> End of period balance\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> At end of period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.45 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.48 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.85 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> During the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.00 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.31 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.34 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nJunior Subordinated Debentures - At December 31, 2018, the Company had four issues of junior subordinated debentures outstanding totaling $21.0 million as shown in the table below.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> Description\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Liquidation\nAmount\nTrust\nPreferred\nSecurities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Issuance Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Interest Rate (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Junior\nSubordinated\nDebt and\nInvestment\nin Trust\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Maturity Date\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory Trust I\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> 2/13/2004\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-month LIBOR + 2.85%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> 2/13/2034\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory Trust II\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> 2/13/2004\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-month LIBOR + 2.85%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> 2/13/2034\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory Trust III\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> 4/15/2004\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-month LIBOR + 2.79%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> 4/15/2034\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory Trust IV\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> 12/14/2006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-month LIBOR + 1.67%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> 3/1/2037\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018, the 3-month LIBOR was 2.80%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption at the liquidation preference. The subordinated debentures are redeemable before the maturity date at our option at their principal amount plus accrued interest.\nThe Company has the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. A deferral period may begin at the Company's discretion so long as interest payments are current.\nOn June 29, 2016, the Company began deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures held by our trust subsidiaries, requiring the trust subsidiaries to defer distributions on the trust preferred securities held by investors. Deferred distributions on the $21.0 million of trust preferred securities outstanding totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2017. In June 2018, the Company paid all deferred interest payments and brought interest current. At December 31, 2018, the Company is current on all interest payments.\nThe Federal Reserve Board rules allow trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 to be included in Tier 1 capital, subject to quantitative and qualitative limits. Currently, no more than 25% of our Tier 1 capital can consist of trust preferred securities and qualifying perpetual preferred stock. To the extent the amount of our trust preferred securities exceeds the 25% limit, the excess would be includable in Tier 2 capital. As of December 31, 2018, the Company's trust preferred securities totaled 21% of its Tier 1 capital and 10% of its Tier 2 capital.\nEach of the trusts issuing the trust preferred securities holds junior subordinated debentures issued with an original maturity of 30 years. In the last five years before the junior subordinated debentures mature, the associated trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 capital and included in Tier 2 capital. In addition, the trust preferred securities during this five-year period are amortized out of Tier 2 capital by one-fifth each year and excluded from Tier 2 capital completely during the year before maturity.\nSenior Debt - On June 30, 2017, the Company entered into a $10.0 million senior secured loan agreement with a commercial bank. The loan matures on June 30, 2022. Interest is payable quarterly at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 250 basis points through June 30, 2020, at which time quarterly principal payments of $250,000 plus interest will commence. The loan is secured by a first priority pledge of 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Bank. The Company may prepay any amount due under the promissory note at any time without premium or penalty.\nThe Company contributed $9.0 million of the borrowing proceeds to the Bank as common equity Tier 1 capital. The remaining $1.0 million of the borrowing proceeds were retained by the lender in escrow to service quarterly interest payments. At December 31, 2018, the escrow account had a balance of $417,000.\nThe loan agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, including the following financial covenants: (i) the Company must maintain minimum cash on hand of not less than $2,500,000, (ii) the Company must maintain a total risk based capital ratio at least equal to 10% of risk-weighted assets, (iii) the Bank must maintain a total risk based capital ratio at least equal to 11% of risk-weighted assets, and (iv) non-performing assets of the Bank may not exceed 2.5% of the Bank's total assets. Both the Company and Bank were in compliance with the covenants as of December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity risk arises from the possibility the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments, or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources. The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers, as well as operating cash needs, taking into account all on- and off-balance sheet funding demands. Liquidity risk management also involves ensuring that cash flow needs are met at a reasonable cost. Management maintains an investment and funds management policy, which identifies the primary sources of liquidity, establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity, and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance. The Asset Liability Committee regularly monitors and reviews our liquidity position.\nFunds are available to the Bank from a number of sources, including the sale of securities in the available for sale investment portfolio, principal pay-downs on loans and mortgage-backed securities, customer deposit inflows, and other wholesale funding.\nThe Bank also borrows from the FHLB to supplement funding requirements. At December 31, 2018, the unused borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $42.7 million. Advances are collateralized by first mortgage residential loans and borrowing capacity is based on the underlying book value of eligible pledged loans.\nThe Bank also has available on an unsecured basis federal funds borrowing line from a correspondent bank totaling $5.0 million. Management believes the sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future. Historically, the Bank has also utilized brokered and wholesale deposits to supplement its funding strategy. At December 31, 2018, the Bank had no brokered deposits.\nThe Company uses cash on hand to service senior debt, service junior subordinated debentures, and to provide for operating cash flow needs. The Company also may issue common equity, preferred equity and debt to support cash flow needs and liquidity requirements. At December 31, 2018, cash on hand totaled $5.4 million, of which, $417,000 is held in escrow by the Company's senior debt holder to service interest payments.\nCapital\nStockholders' equity increased $19.4 million to $92.1 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $72.7 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was due primarily to the $14.9 million issuance of common stock completed during the first quarter of 2018, as well as current year net income $8.8 million, offset by the $3.5 million repurchase of the Company's series E and F preferred shares and the other comprehensive loss for the year of $1.3 million.\nThe Company completed a private placement of common stock on March 30, 2018. In the transaction, the Company issued 150,000 common shares and 1.0 million non-voting common shares to Patriot Financial Partners III, L.P. at $13.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $14.9 million of which $5.0 million was contributed as capital to the Bank. The balance of proceeds was maintained by the Company for general corporate purposes and to support the growth of the Bank.\nThe following table shows the ratios of Tier 1 capital, common equity Tier 1, and total capital to risk-adjusted assets and the leverage ratios (excluding the capital conservation buffer) for the Bank at December 31, 2018:\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Regulatory\nMinimums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Well-Capitalized\nMinimums\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Limestone\nBank\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.83 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common equity Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total risk-based capital\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tier 1 leverage ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements could result in additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if taken, could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition.\nEach of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established risk-based capital requirements for banking organizations. The Basel III regulatory capital reforms became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015, and include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. These rules refine the definition of what constitutes capital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios, including the definitions of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. The final rules allowed banks and their holding companies with less than $250 billion in assets a one-time opportunity to opt-out of a requirement to include unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in their capital calculation. The Company and the Bank opted out of this requirement. The rules also establish a capital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital ratios. Once the capital conservation buffer is fully phased in, the minimum ratios are a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year until fully implemented at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if capital levels fall below minimum levels plus the buffer amounts. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Bank enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of its customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe commitments associated with outstanding standby letters of credit and commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2018 are summarized below. Since commitments associated with letters of credit and commitments to extend credit may expire unused, the amounts shown do not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One year\nor less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 1\nyear but less\nthan 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 years or\nmore but less\nthan 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years\nor more\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitments to extend credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standby letters of credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,855 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nStandby Letters of Credit - Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments the Bank issues to guarantee the performance of a borrower to a third party. If the borrower does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, the Bank may be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Bank could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, the Bank would be entitled to seek recovery from the borrower. The Bank's policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements be underwritten in a manner consistent with a loan of similar characteristics.\nCommitments to Extend Credit - The Bank enters into contractual commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Substantially all of the Bank's commitments to extend credit are contingent upon borrowers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding. The Bank minimizes our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures.\nRisk Participation Agreements - In connection with the purchase of loan participations, the Bank has entered into risk participation agreements, which had notional amounts totaling $26.6 million at December 31, 2018 and $19.8 million at December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> One year\nor less\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 1\nyear but less\nthan 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 years or\nmore but less\nthan 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5 years or\nmore\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time deposits\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>176,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450,886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FHLB borrowing (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,549 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Junior subordinated debentures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>301,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>178,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>528,435 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Fixed rate borrowings with rates ranging from 0% to 5.24%, and maturities ranging from 2019 through 2033, averaging 2.45%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nThe Bank has an asset and liability structure that is essentially monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates, and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates. As market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on loans and investments, the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively.\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of Limestone Bancorp, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Limestone Bancorp, Inc. (the Company\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Limestone Bank, Inc. (the Bank\u201d). The Company is a Louisville, Kentucky-based bank holding company that operates banking offices in twelve Kentucky counties. Our markets include metropolitan Louisville in Jefferson County and the surrounding counties of Henry and Bullitt. The Bank serves south central Kentucky and southern Kentucky from banking offices in Butler, Green, Hart, Edmonson, Barren, Warren, Ohio, and Daviess Counties. The Bank also has an office in Lexington, the second largest city in Kentucky. The Bank is a community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products.\nHistorically, the Bank has focused on commercial and commercial real estate lending, both in markets where we have banking offices and other growing markets in our region. Commercial, commercial real estate and real estate construction loans accounted for 60.9% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, and 58.4% as of December 31, 2017. Commercial lending generally produces higher yields than residential lending, but involves greater risk and requires more rigorous underwriting standards and credit quality monitoring.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other schedules presented elsewhere in the report.\nOverview\nNet income before taxes was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Income tax expense was $2.0 million for 2018 and income tax benefit was $31.9 million for 2017 due to the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $8.8 million compared with net income of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After allocating earnings to participating securities, net income attributable to common shareholders was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted income per common share were $1.23 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net income per common share of $6.15 for 2017, and net loss per common share of ($0.46) for 2016.\nThe following significant items are of note for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n \u25cf Average loans receivable increased approximately $75.9 million or 11.4% to $743.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $667.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loan interest income benefited with an increase in interest revenue volume of approximately $3.8 million and interest rate increases of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u25cf Net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.53% for the year ended 2018 compared with 3.48% in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in margin between periods was primarily due to an increase in the rate of interest earned on interest earning assets from 4.18% in 2017 to 4.55% in 2018, which was partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.83% to 1.23%. \n \u25cf Improving trends in asset quality continued. The Company recorded negative provision for loan losses expense of $500,000 in 2018, compared to a negative provision for loan losses expense of $800,000 for 2017. The negative provision was attributable to net loan recoveries, declining historical loss rates, improvements in loan quality, and management's assessment of risk in the loan portfolio. Net loan recoveries were $1.2 million for 2018, compared to net loan recoveries of $35,000 for 2017 and net loan charge-offs of $624,000 for 2016. \n \u25cf Nonaccrual loans decreased $3.5 million to $2.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $5.5 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to $3.6 million in paydowns, $293,000 in charge-offs, $77,000 in loans returned to accrual status, and $730,000 in transfers to OREO, offset by $1.2 million in loans placed on non-accrual. \n \u25cf The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.60% at December 31, 2018, compared with 1.14% at December 31, 2017, and 1.70% at December 31, 2016. \n \u25cf Deposits were $894.2 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $847.0 million at December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $5.2 million or 3.8% during 2018 to $142.6 million compared with $137.4 million at December 31, 2017. Money market accounts increased $20.5 million or 13.6% during 2018 to $171.9 million compared with $151.4 million at December 31, 2017. Certificate of deposit balances increased $26.7 million during 2018 to $450.9 million at December 31, 2018, from $424.2 million at December 31, 2017. \n \u25cf The Company completed a private placement of common stock on March 30, 2018. In the transaction, the Company issued 150,000 common shares and 1.0 million non-voting common shares to Patriot Financial Partners III, L.P. at $13.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $14.9 million of which $5.0 million was contributed as capital to the Bank. The balance of proceeds was maintained by the Company for general corporate purposes and to support the growth of the Bank. \n \u25cf On June 26, 2018, the Company completed the purchase and retirement of all of its issued and outstanding Series E and Series F Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Shares for an aggregate price of $3.5 million paid in cash. The Series E and Series F Shares had an aggregate liquidation preference of $10.5 million. \nThese items are discussed in further detail throughout this Item 7.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Management believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of management assumptions and judgments that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance using, among other things, historical loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions and trends. The allowance may be allocated for specific loans or loan categories, but the entire allowance is available for any loan. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually evaluated and measured for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative environmental factors. Management develops allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends. Allowance estimates are a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio applied to individual loans based on loan type. If the mix and amount of future charge-off percentages differ significantly from the assumptions used by management in making its determination, management may be required to materially increase its allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses, which could adversely affect results.\nOther Real Estate Owned - OREO is real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. It is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. OREO is recorded at its fair market value less estimated cost to sell. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred in order to perfect the lien prior to foreclosure may be capitalized if the fair value less the cost to sell exceeds the balance of the loan at the time of transfer to OREO. Examples of eligible costs to be capitalized are payments of delinquent property taxes to clear tax liens or payments to contractors and subcontractors to clear mechanics' liens. Fair value of OREO is determined on an individual property basis. To determine the fair value of OREO for smaller dollar single family homes, management consults with staff from the Bank's special assets group as well as external realtors and appraisers. If the internally evaluated market price is below the underlying investment in the property, appropriate write-downs are taken. For larger dollar residential and commercial real estate properties, management obtains a new appraisal of the subject property or has staff from our special assets group evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to OREO. Management generally obtains updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent. When an asking price is lowered below the most recent appraised value, appropriate write-downs are taken.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred tax liabilities ( DTLs\u201d) and assets ( DTAs\u201d) are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. A DTL or DTA is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward (used) in future years. The valuation of current and deferred income tax liabilities and assets is considered critical, as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws. The assessment of tax liabilities and assets involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes.\nThere can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings. The Company believes its tax assets and liabilities are adequate and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2018 compared with 2017:\n\nNM: Not Meaningful\nNet income of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $29.7 million from net income of $38.5 million for 2017. Net income for 2017 was impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $31.9 million for 2017. During 2018, improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories continued. A negative provision for loan losses expense of $500,000 was recorded during 2018, compared to $800,000 negative provision for loan losses expense for 2017. Non-interest income increased $669,000 during 2018. There was an increase of $310,000 in bank card interchange fees, $232,000 in other non-interest income, and $102,000 in service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest expense decreased $1.6 million during 2018 due primarily to decreases in OREO expense of $1.1 million and FDIC insurance of $855,000 offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $399,000.\nThe following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2017 compared with 2016:\n\nNM: Not Meaningful\nNet income of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $41.2 million from a net loss of $2.8 million for 2016. During the period, improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories continued. In addition, net income for 2017 was impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The net result of these two items, as well as income tax expense for the year, was an income tax benefit of $31.9 million for 2017. A negative provision for loan losses expense of $800,000 was recorded during 2017, compared to $2.5 million negative provision for loan losses expense for 2016. Non-interest income increased $114,000 during 2017. There was an increase of $295,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, $218,000 in bank card interchange fees, and $62,000 in other non-interest income which was offset by no OREO income during 2017, compared to $456,000 during 2016. Non-interest expense decreased $9.3 million during 2017 due primarily to a decrease in litigation and loan collection expense of $8.6 million as 2016 was negatively impacted by a ruling from the Kentucky Court of Appeals against the Bank that approximated $8.0 million. After consideration of earnings attributable to participating securities, net income attributable to common shareholders was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for 2016.\nNet Interest Income - Net interest income was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, compared with $31.1 million for the same period in 2017. Net interest spread and margin were 3.32% and 3.53%, respectively, for 2018, compared with 3.35% and 3.48%, respectively, for 2017. Average nonaccrual loans were $3.5 million and $7.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAverage interest-earning assets were $957.5 million for 2018, compared with $904.1 million for 2017, a 5.9% increase, primarily attributable to higher average loans, partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities. Average loans were $743.4 million for 2018, compared with $667.5 million for 2017, an 11.4% increase. Average investment securities were $178.9 million for 2018, compared with $193.1 million for 2017, a 7.3% decrease. Average interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and fed funds sold were $27.9 million in 2018, compared with $36.2 million in 2017, a 22.8% decrease. Total interest income increased 15.8% to $43.5 million for 2018, compared with $37.5 million for 2017.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by 3.3% to $799.0 million for 2018, compared with $773.2 million for 2017. Total interest expense increased by 52.8% to $9.8 million for 2018, compared with $6.4 million during 2017, due primarily to increases in rates paid on certificates of deposits and other time deposits as well as increases in average balances of FHLB advances in 2018 compared to 2017. Average volume of certificates of deposit decreased 2.8% to $439.6 million for 2018, compared with $452.4 million for 2017. The average interest rate paid on certificates of deposit increased to 1.35% for 2018, compared with 0.93% for 2017. Average volume of interest checking and money market deposit accounts increased 0.9% to $249.4 million for 2018, compared with $247.3 million for 2017. The average interest rate paid on interest checking and money market deposit accounts increased to 0.62% for 2018, compared with 0.38% for 2017. Both the yield on earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities were impacted by increases in short-term interest rates during 2017 and 2018.\nNet interest income was $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.5 million, or 5.1%, compared with $29.6 million for the same period in 2016. Net interest spread and margin were 3.35% and 3.48%, respectively, for 2017, compared with 3.32% and 3.42%, respectively, for 2016. Average nonaccrual loans were $7.1 million and $11.4 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAverage interest-earning assets were $904.1 million for 2017, compared with $875.3 million for 2016, a 3.3% increase, primarily attributable to higher average loans and investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest bearing deposits with financial institutions. Average loans were $667.5 million for 2017, compared with $621.3 million for 2016, a 7.4% increase. Average investment securities were $193.1 million for 2017, compared with $183.7 million for 2016, a 5.1% increase. Average interest bearing deposits with financial institutions and fed funds sold were $36.2 million in 2017, compared with $62.9 million in 2016, a 42.4% decrease. Total interest income increased 5.4% to $37.5 million for 2017, compared with $35.6 million for 2016.\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities increased by 1.7% to $773.2 million for 2017, compared with $760.7 million for 2016. Total interest expense increased by 7.1% to $6.4 million for 2017, compared with $6.0 million during 2016, due primarily to the completion of a $10.0 million senior debt transaction during 2017 as well as an increase in FHLB advances outstanding during 2017. Average volume of certificates of deposit decreased 2.9% to $452.4 million for 2017, compared with $466.0 million for 2016. The average interest rate paid on certificates of deposit increased to 0.93% for 2017, compared with 0.88% for 2016.

Financial Condition and Results of Operation\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of Limestone Bancorp, Inc. (the Company\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Limestone Bank, Inc. (the Bank\u201d). The Company is a Louisville, Kentucky-based bank holding company that operates banking offices in twelve Kentucky counties. Our markets include metropolitan Louisville in Jefferson County and the surrounding counties of Henry and Bullitt. The Bank serves south central Kentucky and southern Kentucky from banking offices in Butler, Green, Hart, Edmonson, Barren, Warren, Ohio, and Daviess Counties. The Bank also has an office in Lexington, the second largest city in Kentucky. The Bank is a community bank with a wide range of commercial and personal banking products.\nHistorically, the Bank has focused on commercial and commercial real estate lending, both in markets where we have banking offices and other growing markets in our region. Commercial, commercial real estate and real estate construction loans accounted for 60.9% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, and 58.4% as of December 31, 2017. Commercial lending generally produces higher yields than residential lending, but involves greater risk and requires more rigorous underwriting standards and credit quality monitoring.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other schedules presented elsewhere in the report.\nOverview\nNet income before taxes was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Income tax expense was $2.0 million for 2018 and income tax benefit was $31.9 million for 2017 due to the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $8.8 million compared with net income of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and a net loss of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. After allocating earnings to participating securities, net income attributable to common shareholders was $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net income attributable to common shareholders of $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted income per common share were $1.23 for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with net income per common share of $6.15 for 2017, and net loss per common share of ($0.46) for 2016.\nThe following significant items are of note for the year ended December 31, 2018:\n \u25cf Average loans receivable increased approximately $75.9 million or 11.4% to $743.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with $667.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loan interest income benefited with an increase in interest revenue volume of approximately $3.8 million and interest rate increases of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u25cf Net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.53% for the year ended 2018 compared with 3.48% in the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in margin between periods was primarily due to an increase in the rate of interest earned on interest earning assets from 4.18% in 2017 to 4.55% in 2018, which was partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities from 0.83% to 1.23%. \n \u25cf Improving trends in asset quality continued. The Company recorded negative provision for loan losses expense of $500,000 in 2018, compared to a negative provision for loan losses expense of $800,000 for 2017. The negative provision was attributable to net loan recoveries, declining historical loss rates, improvements in loan quality, and management's assessment of risk in the loan portfolio. Net loan recoveries were $1.2 million for 2018, compared to net loan recoveries of $35,000 for 2017 and net loan charge-offs of $624,000 for 2016. \n \u25cf Nonaccrual loans decreased $3.5 million to $2.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $5.5 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to $3.6 million in paydowns, $293,000 in charge-offs, $77,000 in loans returned to accrual status, and $730,000 in transfers to OREO, offset by $1.2 million in loans placed on non-accrual. \n \u25cf The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets decreased to 0.60% at December 31, 2018, compared with 1.14% at December 31, 2017, and 1.70% at December 31, 2016. \n \u25cf Deposits were $894.2 million at December 31, 2018, compared with $847.0 million at December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $5.2 million or 3.8% during 2018 to $142.6 million compared with $137.4 million at December 31, 2017. Money market accounts increased $20.5 million or 13.6% during 2018 to $171.9 million compared with $151.4 million at December 31, 2017. Certificate of deposit balances increased $26.7 million during 2018 to $450.9 million at December 31, 2018, from $424.2 million at December 31, 2017. \n \u25cf The Company completed a private placement of common stock on March 30, 2018. In the transaction, the Company issued 150,000 common shares and 1.0 million non-voting common shares to Patriot Financial Partners III, L.P. at $13.00 per share resulting in net proceeds of $14.9 million of which $5.0 million was contributed as capital to the Bank. The balance of proceeds was maintained by the Company for general corporate purposes and to support the growth of the Bank. \n \u25cf On June 26, 2018, the Company completed the purchase and retirement of all of its issued and outstanding Series E and Series F Non-Voting Perpetual Preferred Shares for an aggregate price of $3.5 million paid in cash. The Series E and Series F Shares had an aggregate liquidation preference of $10.5 million. \nThese items are discussed in further detail throughout this Item 7.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's accounting and reporting policies comply with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Management believes the following significant accounting policies may involve a higher degree of management assumptions and judgments that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change.\nAllowance for Loan Losses - The Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses believed to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio. The Board of Directors evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis. Management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance using, among other things, historical loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated value of the underlying collateral and current economic conditions and trends. The allowance may be allocated for specific loans or loan categories, but the entire allowance is available for any loan. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually evaluated and measured for impairment. The general component is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative environmental factors. Management develops allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends. Allowance estimates are a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio applied to individual loans based on loan type. If the mix and amount of future charge-off percentages differ significantly from the assumptions used by management in making its determination, management may be required to materially increase its allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses, which could adversely affect results.\nOther Real Estate Owned - OREO is real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. It is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. OREO is recorded at its fair market value less estimated cost to sell. Any write-down of the property at the time of acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred in order to perfect the lien prior to foreclosure may be capitalized if the fair value less the cost to sell exceeds the balance of the loan at the time of transfer to OREO. Examples of eligible costs to be capitalized are payments of delinquent property taxes to clear tax liens or payments to contractors and subcontractors to clear mechanics' liens. Fair value of OREO is determined on an individual property basis. To determine the fair value of OREO for smaller dollar single family homes, management consults with staff from the Bank's special assets group as well as external realtors and appraisers. If the internally evaluated market price is below the underlying investment in the property, appropriate write-downs are taken. For larger dollar residential and commercial real estate properties, management obtains a new appraisal of the subject property or has staff from our special assets group evaluate the latest in-file appraisal in connection with the transfer to OREO. Management generally obtains updated appraisals within five quarters of the anniversary date of ownership unless a sale is imminent. When an asking price is lowered below the most recent appraised value, appropriate write-downs are taken.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax liabilities or assets are established for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. Deferred tax liabilities ( DTLs\u201d) and assets ( DTAs\u201d) are also established for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax returns. A DTL or DTA is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and deductions that can be carried forward (used) in future years. The valuation of current and deferred income tax liabilities and assets is considered critical, as it requires management to make estimates based on provisions of the enacted tax laws. The assessment of tax liabilities and assets involves the use of estimates, assumptions, interpretations and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes.\nThere can be no assurance that future events, such as court decisions or positions of federal and state taxing authorities, will not differ from management's current assessment, the impact of which could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings. The Company believes its tax assets and liabilities are adequate and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2018 compared with 2017:\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change from Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (negative provision) for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(500 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(800 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sale of securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(294 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(102.1 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,641 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income before taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,899 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,929 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,794 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,659 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM: Not Meaningful\nNet income of $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $29.7 million from net income of $38.5 million for 2017. Net income for 2017 was impacted by the reversal of the Company's deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the change in federal corporate tax rates in connection with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This resulted in an income tax benefit of $31.9 million for 2017. During 2018, improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories continued. A negative provision for loan losses expense of $500,000 was recorded during 2018, compared to $800,000 negative provision for loan losses expense for 2017. Non-interest income increased $669,000 during 2018. There was an increase of $310,000 in bank card interchange fees, $232,000 in other non-interest income, and $102,000 in service charges on deposit accounts. Non-interest expense decreased $1.6 million during 2018 due primarily to decreases in OREO expense of $1.1 million and FDIC insurance of $855,000 offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $399,000.\nThe following table summarizes components of income and expense and the change in those components for 2017 compared with 2016:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the\nYears Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change from Prior Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision (negative provision) for loan losses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(800 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,450 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gains on sale of securities, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,254 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.1 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) before taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,732 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>339.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,899 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,920 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,753 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNM: Not Meaningful\nNet income of $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $41.2 million from a net loss of $2.8 million for 2016. During the period, improving trends in non-performing loans, past due loans, and loan risk categories continued.

There was an increase of $295,000 in service charges on deposit accounts, $218,000 in bank card interchange fees, and $62,000 in other non-interest income which was offset by no OREO income during 2017, compared to $456,000 during 2016. Non-interest expense decreased $9.3 million during 2017 due primarily to a decrease in litigation and loan collection expense of $8.6 million as 2016 was negatively impacted by a ruling from the Kentucky Court of Appeals against the Bank that approximated $8.0 million. After consideration of earnings attributable to participating securities, net income attributable to common shareholders was $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for 2016.\nNet Interest Income - Net interest income was $33.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, compared with $31.1 million for the same period in 2017.
