Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe have changed our fiscal year end from May 31 to April 30, effective for our fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years. Accordingly, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reported fiscal 2016 as the period of May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2016 and fiscal 2015 as the 11-month transition period from June 1, 2014 through April 30, 2015.\nWithin this Management's Discussion and Analysis, fiscal 2016 is compared to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported. In addition, to facilitate comparisons to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported, we have presented the similar unaudited 11-month period as recast for fiscal 2014 (June 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data presented above, our Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented, as well as our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, fair value of equity-based compensation, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, restructuring obligations and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience and on other information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made. We believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from our estimates.\nAny reference to we, our, us, Infor or the Company refers to Infor, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nManagement Overview\nGeneral\nInfor is a global provider of enterprise business applications software and services focused primarily on medium and large enterprises. We develop, market, distribute and service enterprise software applications that help organizations manage their businesses. We deliver integrated enterprise business solutions including customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise asset management (EAM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), financial management, human capital management (HCM), performance management, product lifecycle management, property management systems, central reservations systems, supplier relationship management and supply chain management (SCM), including business-specific inventory management, transportation logistics, manufacturing and warehouse management software. Infor also offers software license updates and product support as well as other services including consulting, advanced product services, hosting and education.\nIndex to Financial Statements We offer a broad range of software applications and industry-specific solutions that we believe help our customers improve their business processes and reduce costs, resulting in better business or operational performance. Our solutions help automate and integrate critical business processes which enable our customers to better manage their suppliers, partners, customers and employees.\nWe specialize in and target specific industries (or verticals), and have industry-specific business units that leverage our industry-oriented products and teams. We provide industry-specific ERP software products to companies in the manufacturing, distribution, healthcare, public sector, automotive, service industries, equipment services, management and rental (ESM&R), consumer products & retail and hospitality industries. Our industry-specific approach distinguishes us from larger competing ERP vendors, whose primary focus is on less specialized software programs that take more time and cost to tailor to our target customers' specific needs. Augmenting our vertical-specific applications, we have leading horizontal software applications, including our CRM, EAM, HCM, SCM and financial application suites, which, through our proprietary light-weight middleware solution ION, are integrated with our enterprise software applications and sold across verticals.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of perpetual software licenses granting customers use of our software products, providing access to software products through our SaaS subscription offerings, providing product updates and support and providing consulting services to our customers. We operate in three segments: License, Maintenance and Consulting. We market and sell our software and services primarily through a direct sales force, which is augmented by systems integrators and resellers. In addition to providing software products, we generate substantial recurring revenue by providing on-going software support services to our customers through our maintenance and support programs. The product updates and support we provide are valued by our customers as evidenced by our high annual maintenance retention rates. We also help our customers implement and use our applications effectively through our consulting services offerings, including training, implementation and consulting services.\nWe serve customers across three geographic regions-the Americas, EMEA and APAC. We have approximately 14,390 employees worldwide and have offices in 43 countries. We have established a worldwide infrastructure for distribution, development and support of our enterprise software. This worldwide coverage provides us with both economies of scale and the ability to leverage our geographical expertise to effectively enter new markets and segments. In fiscal 2016, our Americas, EMEA and APAC regions generated approximately 62.8%, 29.6% and 7.6% of our revenues, respectively. Though we have a considerable presence outside of the U.S. today, we believe we have significant opportunities to expand internationally and capture market share, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions.\nFiscal 2016 Overview\nFiscal 2016 was another year of investment, innovation and growth for Infor as we continued our pivot to the cloud. We continued to make significant investments in our products to meet the specific needs of customers in targeted microvertical industries, in our user interface to unify and beautify the user experience, and in upgrading our customer base through Infor UpgradeX to Infor CloudSuite. Flexibility, agility, collaboration, mobility and ease of use are our key design principles focused on helping our customers become faster and more efficient.\nWe now have more than 58 million users accessing Infor cloud applications in 100 different countries. We have expanded our Infor CloudSuite portfolio by delivering 12 industry suites: Infor CloudSuite Automotive, Infor CloudSuite Aerospace & Defense, Infor CloudSuite Chemicals, Infor CloudSuite Distribution, Infor CloudSuite Equipment, Infor CloudSuite Fashion, Infor CloudSuite Food & Beverage, Infor CloudSuite Healthcare, Infor CloudSuite High-Tech, Infor CloudSuite Hospitality, Infor CloudSuite Industrial, and Infor CloudSuite Public Sector. We also delivered Infor CloudSuite Corporate and Infor CloudSuite Business, ready-to-run ERP cloud platforms that provide streamlined back-office management and deep visibility into business facets, from financials, reporting, and human resources to supply chain, project, sales, and customer relationship management for large enterprises (Corporate) and SMBs (Business). We also offer CloudSuite products for Financial Management (Infor CloudSuite Financials) and facilities management (Infor CloudSuite Facilities).Infor now has more than 4,700 cloud customers in more than 7,200 customer sites. As a result of our robust CloudSuite offerings, our SaaS revenues continued to experience significant growth in fiscal 2016.\nWe are actively rolling-out our Infor Xi platform across all of our growth products, with many complete this year. Building on our previous release, Infor 10x, Infor Xi delivers a major step in achieving our vision for cloud applications that address specific industry needs with responsive design infused with machine-learning and big data analytics.\nOur fiscal 2016 results were driven by our continued investments in innovative products and applications and the expansion of our CloudSuite offerings. We entered into over 16,570 deals and added approximately 2,500 new customers. Our customer retention rate continues to exceed 93%. Our average deal size continues to grow; we experienced a 37.1% increase in the number of deals valued at greater than $1 million and a 14.3% increase in the average size of deals valued at greater than $1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Total revenues increased by 15.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5.1%, as we realized strong growth in our software license fees and subscription revenue across all regions.\nIndex to Financial Statements Acquisitions\nAn acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. We have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases our overall value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. Operating results relating to these acquisitions have been included in our results of operations as of the applicable acquisition dates.\nWe believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings, or additional equity. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nFiscal 2016 Acquisitions\nOn September 18, 2015, we acquired a majority ownership stake of 81.48% in GT Nexus, for $549.9 million, net of cash acquired (the GT Nexus Acquisition). GT Nexus is a cloud-based SCM vendor based in Oakland, California and provides the cloud platform that some of the world's largest companies, across many sectors, such as manufacturing and retail, use to monitor and orchestrate their global supply chains including automation of sourcing, trade finance and logistics operations, enabling Infor to create a global commerce cloud providing end-to-end visibility and control across physical and financial supply chains. We funded the total consideration related to this transaction through the use of the proceeds of the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes discussed below, together with cash on hand and equity issued to certain shareholders and management of GT Nexus.\nFiscal 2015 Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2015, we completed one acquisition. On September 2, 2014, we acquired the assets of Saleslogix, a division of privately held Swiftpage, Inc., for approximately $30.1 million, net of cash acquired. Based in Scottsdale, Arizona, Saleslogix is a provider of SaaS CRM software accessible via mobile devices, desktops, and laptops. The acquisition of Saleslogix complemented our CRM product offerings and added additional sales and service functionality to our industry-focused Infor CloudSuites in the high-growth CRM market.\nFiscal 2014 Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2014, we completed two acquisitions. On January 7, 2014, we acquired PeopleAnswers, a privately held company based in Dallas, Texas, for approximately $200.0 million. PeopleAnswers is a provider of predictive talent analytics which complemented and further expanded our Infor HCM suite. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed an additional acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $1.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nOver the past few fiscal years, we have undertaken significant financing activities in conjunction with our acquisitions and the recapitalization and refinancing of our debt structure.\nIn fiscal 2016, in connection with the GT Nexus Acquisition, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% first lien senior secured notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), after fees and expenses, of approximately $478.5 million were used to fund the GT Nexus Acquisition, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2015 we issued $1,630.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes and \u0080350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes. The proceeds from the issuance of the 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes were used to repay the balance of all of our outstanding senior notes, including our 9 3/8%, 10.0% and 11.5% Senior Notes, as well as applicable redemption premiums thereon, accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2014 we amended our Credit Agreement to refinance all of our then outstanding term loans under our credit facilities at favorable interest rates and extended the applicable maturity dates.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt, below for details of our financing activities.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2014 affiliates of Infor issued senior notes to finance the repayment of their existing debt and fund distributions to our equity investors. On April 8, 2014, Infor Software Parent, LLC (HoldCo), an indirect holding company for Infor, and its direct subsidiary Infor Software Parent, Inc., issued $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of their 7.125%/7.875% Senior Contingent Cash Pay Notes (the HoldCo Notes). Proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to repay the outstanding balance of HoldCo's affiliate's existing debt of $166.8 million, to make a $565.5 distribution to HoldCo equityholders, to pay a call premium and accrued interest related to their existing debt, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses. We may from time-to-time service interest payments related to the HoldCo Notes. Any payment of interest that we may pay will be funded primarily through dividend distributions from Infor to HoldCo. We have not reflected the HoldCo Notes in our Consolidated Financial Statements for any of the periods presented in accordance with applicable SEC guidance. See Note 12, Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our affiliate company borrowings.\nIndex to Financial Statements Restructuring Activities\nOver the past few years, in response to the challenging and sometimes uncertain domestic and global economic conditions, we have undertaken certain restructuring actions to reduce our headcount and streamline our operations. We have also taken certain actions to better focus our efforts on our targeted industry-specific solutions. In addition, as a result of our active acquisition program, we have taken certain actions related to acquired entities from time-to-time to streamline back-office functions and eliminate redundancies incurred through acquisitions. We also restructured and consolidated office lease arrangements to eliminate redundant locations worldwide.\nOur results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 include restructuring charges of $28.0 million, $5.7 million and $18.6 million, respectively, relating to these actions. We continue to closely monitor our discretionary spending while preserving targeted investments that we believe will facilitate our long-term growth and increase our operational efficiencies. During fiscal 2016, we engaged an outside consulting firm to provide restructuring advisory services focusing on all areas of our operations across all geographies. Specific actions related to these efforts are reflected in the restructuring charges taken in fiscal 2016. We may consider possible future actions to reduce our operating costs if circumstances warrant.\nForeign Currency\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro and British Pound. Our revenues and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. Downward fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to a foreign currency generally have the effect of increasing our revenues but also increasing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Similarly, strengthening in the U.S. Dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In addition, we have certain intercompany transfer pricing transactions, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are not considered permanent in nature. Fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these intercompany balances may impact our results of operations.\nFor fiscal 2016, the average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound strengthened by approximately 9.9% and 5.5%, respectively, as compared to the average exchange rates for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015, the average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound strengthened by approximately 8.9% and 1.2%, respectively, as compared to the average exchange rates for fiscal 2014.\nOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, the most current period results for our entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the average exchange rates in effect in the prior comparable period) rather than the average exchange rates in effect during the respective period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual results in reported currency and in constant currency.\nThe following tables summarize the period-over-period change, both in U.S. Dollars and percentages, in revenues and costs and expenses, isolating the fluctuations in exchange rates from changes in activity and pricing on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 versus the 11-month transition period ended April 30, 2015, and for the 11-month transition period ended April 30, 2015 versus the comparable unaudited 11-month period ended April 30, 2014, as recast:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The policies that reflect those areas that require more significant use of estimates, judgments and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements include the following:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue Recognition; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Business Combinations; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Restructuring; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Valuation of Accounts Receivable; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Valuation and Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Contingencies-Litigation Reserves; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Equity-Based Compensation. </td> </tr>\n</table> In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management and investors to evaluate our performance. Revenue recognition for software businesses is very complex. We follow specific guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded. However, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to year. The significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable. In addition, our transactions often consist of multiple-element arrangements, which typically include software license fees, maintenance and support fees and consulting service fees. The amounts of revenue reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations may vary, due to the amount of judgment required to address significant assumptions, risks and uncertainties in applying the guidelines under GAAP.\nWe generate revenues primarily by licensing software and SaaS subscriptions, providing software support and product updates, and providing consulting services to our customers. We record software license, product updates and support, and related service revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, and we record revenues related to non-software deliverables such as SaaS subscriptions and related service revenue in accordance with guidance provided by ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded net of applicable taxes. Our specific revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nIndex to Financial Statements Software license fees and subscriptions\nSoftware license fees and subscriptions revenues are primarily from sales of perpetual software licenses granting customers use of our software products and access to software products through our SaaS subscription offerings. Software license fees are recognized when the following criteria are met: 1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, 2) the software product has been delivered, 3) the fees are fixed or determinable and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. SaaS subscription revenues are recognized over the contract term once the software is made available for use in an environment hosted, supported, and maintained by Infor.\nWe do not generally offer rights of return or acceptance clauses. If a software license contains rights of return or customer acceptance criteria, recognition of the software license fee revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation of the right of return.\nWe record revenues from sales of third-party products on a \u201cgross\u201d basis pursuant to ASC 605-45 Revenue Recognition, Principal Agent Considerations, when we are the primary obligor in the arrangement with the end customer and have the risks and rewards as principal in the transaction, such as responsibility for fulfillment, retaining the risk for collection, and establishing the price of the products. If these indicators have not been met, or if indicators of net revenue reporting specified in ASC 605-45 are present in the arrangement, revenue is recognized net of related direct costs.\nRevenue arrangements through our resellers that involve Infor contracting directly with an end user follow the same revenue recognition rules as our direct sales business. Revenue arrangements which involve Infor contracting directly with a reseller are generally recognized when the reseller purchases a product for resale to an identified end user provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nWe enter into multiple element arrangements for software and software-related products and services, which may include software licenses, product updates and support and/or implementation and consulting services agreements. Revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based upon their fair value as determined by vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE). VSOE of fair value for the elements in an arrangement reflects the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately.\nWe generally do not have VSOE of fair value for software license fees as software licenses are typically not sold separately from product updates and support. Since the fair value of a delivered element (license) has not been established, the residual method is used to record license revenue when VSOE of fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable. Under the residual method, the VSOE of fair value of an undelivered element (product updates and support and/or services) is deferred and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered element (license) and is recognized as revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 985-605. In instances where VSOE of fair value of one or more of the undelivered elements is not established, license revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement once all other services have been delivered and one undelivered element remains.\nCertain software products are offered as term based license arrangements where the customer has the right to use the software for a specified period of time. Under these arrangements, license fees for multi-year term licenses can either be recognized up front when product updates and support obligations are charged separately and the product updates and support renewal rate and term are considered substantive, or are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying arrangement if the product updates and support renewal rate and term are not considered to be substantive.\nFor customer arrangements that include software license fees, implementation and/or other consulting services, the portion of the fees related to software licenses is generally recognized when delivered, as the implementation and consulting services typically qualify for separate recognition. The significant factors considered in determining whether the elements constitute multiple units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes include: 1) the nature of the services and consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product, 2) degree of risk related to delivering the services, 3) availability of comparable services from other vendors, 4) timing of payments and 5) impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the recognition of the software license fee. The portion of the fees related to implementation and other consulting services is recognized as such services are performed. If there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the services, revenues are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved. If it is determined that the services are not separable from the arrangement for revenue recognition purposes, the license fees and services are recognized using contract accounting either on a percentage of completion basis, measured by the percentage of labor hours incurred to date to estimated total labor hours for each contract, or on a completed contract basis when dependable estimates are not available. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements: 1) that include milestones or customer-specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees; 2) where services include significant modification or customization of the software; or 3) where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services.\nWe also enter into multiple element arrangements that may include a combination of our various software-related and non-software- related products and services offerings including software licenses, SaaS subscriptions, product updates and support, consulting services, education and hosting services. Each element within a non-software multiple element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided the following criteria of ASC 605-25 are met: 1) the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and 2) if the arrangement includes a general right to return relative to the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control. We consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by Infor or another vendor or could be resold by the customer. In such arrangements, we first allocate the total arrangement\nIndex to Financial Statements\nconsideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the non-software elements. We then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group following the guidance in ASC 985-605 and our policies as described above. For the non-software group, revenue is then allocated to each element using a selling price hierarchy; VSOE if available, third-party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (BESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE are available.\nTo determine the selling price in non-software multiple-element arrangements, we establish VSOE of selling prices, as described earlier, to the extent possible. We establish TPE by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone arrangements with similarly situated customers. If we are unable to determine the selling price because VSOE or TPE is unavailable, BESP is determined for the purposes of allocating the arrangement. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which the vendor would transact if the deliverable were sold by the vendor regularly on a standalone basis. Infor determines BESP for its offerings by considering many factors, including, but not limited to, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices.\nProduct Updates and Support Fees\nProduct updates and support fees entitle the customer to receive, for an agreed upon period, unspecified product upgrades (when and if available), release updates, regulatory updates and patches, as well as support services including access to technical information and technical support staff. The term of product updates and support services is typically twelve months. The product updates and support fees are recorded as product updates and support fees revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. Revenues for product updates and support that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the VSOE of fair value of the bundled product updates and support and recognized over the term of the agreement.\nConsulting Services and Other Fees\nWe also provide software-related services, including systems implementation and integration services, consulting, training, custom modification and application managed services. Consulting services are usually separately priced and are generally not essential to the functionality of our software products. Consulting services are generally provided under time and materials contracts and revenues are recognized as the services are provided. However, when we enter into arrangements with a fixed-fee or a maximum-fee basis where services are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, revenue is recognized based upon a proportionate performance method. When we enter into arrangements where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software, revenue is recognized based upon a percentage of completion method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based upon labor hours incurred as a percentage of total estimated labor hours to complete the project. Provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Revenues for consulting services that are bundled with license fees are deferred based on the VSOE of fair value of the bundled services and recognized when the services are performed.\nConsulting services and other fees also include education and hosting services. Hosted customers with perpetual licenses have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosted period. The customer has the right to choose not to renew its hosting arrangement upon its expiration and can deploy the software internally or contract with another party unrelated to Infor to host the software. Customers can self-host and any penalties to do so are not significant. Accordingly, the portion of an arrangement allocated to the hosting element is recognized once the service begins and then ratably over the term of the hosting arrangement.\nIn accordance with the provisions set forth in ASC 605, we recognize amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses as revenue on a gross basis. Such amounts have been classified as consulting services and other fees.\nDeferred Revenues\nDeferred revenues represent amounts billed or payments received from customers for software licenses, SaaS subscriptions, product updates and support and/or services in advance of recognizing revenue or performing services. We defer revenues for any undelivered elements, and recognize revenues when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed, in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such elements. Product updates and support is normally billed quarterly or annually in advance of performing the service.\nDeferred Costs\nCommissions payable to our direct sales force and independent affiliates who resell our software products, as well as royalties payable to third-party software vendors, are recorded when a sale is completed or cash received, which coincides with the timing of revenue recognition in most cases. When revenue is recognized ratably over time, related commissions and royalties are deferred and amortized over the same period as the recognition of the revenue.\nIndex to Financial Statements Collectability\nWe assess the probability of collection based upon several factors including 1) third-party credit agency information, 2) customer financial statements and/or 3) customer payment history. We typically do not provide for payment terms in excess of six months. Certain customer arrangements are recognized upon collection due to their specific collection history.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. ASC 805 requires recognition of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed separately from goodwill, generally at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While best estimates and assumptions are used as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill, are recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in our results of operations in the reporting period such adjustments are made.\nAccounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, support obligations assumed, estimated restructuring liabilities, contingent consideration and pre-acquisition contingencies. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>future expected cash flows from software license fees and subscriptions, product updates and support fees, consulting contracts, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>expected costs to develop the in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the acquired company's brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company's product portfolio; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>discount rates. </td> </tr>\n</table> Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of product updates and support, SaaS subscription and service contract obligations assumed. The acquired deferred revenue is recognized at fair value to the extent it represents a legal obligation assumed by Infor. We consider post-contract support (PCS) obligations/services in their entirety, SaaS subscription contracts and service contracts to be legal obligations of the acquired entity. PCS arrangements of acquired entities typically include unspecified product upgrades (when and if available), release updates, regulatory updates and patches, as well as support including access to technical information and technical support staff. SaaS subscription arrangements of acquired entities provide access to product functionality through a hosted environment and other services. We consider PCS and SaaS subscription arrangements to be separate elements when determining the legal obligations assumed from the acquired entity. We expect to fulfill each underlying obligation element of these arrangements. The estimated fair values of these PCS arrangements, SaaS subscription contracts and service contracts are determined utilizing a top-down approach. The top-down approach relies on market indicators of expected revenue for any obligation yet to be delivered with appropriate adjustments. Conceptually, we start with the amount we would expect to receive in a transaction, less the estimated selling effort, which has already been performed, including an estimated profit margin on that selling effort.\nThe purchase agreements related to certain of our acquisitions may include provisions for the payment of additional cash consideration if certain future performance conditions are met. These contingent consideration arrangements are to be recognized at their acquisition date fair value and included as part of the purchase price at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of these contingent consideration arrangements are classified as accrued liabilities or other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As such, their fair value is remeasured each reporting period with any change in fair value being recognized in the applicable period's results of operations and included in acquisition-related and other costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Measuring the fair value of contingent consideration at the acquisition date, and for all subsequent remeasurement periods, requires a careful examination of the facts and circumstances to determine the probable resolution of the contingency(ies).\nIndex to Financial Statements In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items periodically with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values. Subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value or tax related valuation allowances, changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nRestructuring\nCosts to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company, or our internal operations, are accounted for as one-time termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. If acquisition related, they are accounted for separately from the business combination. Liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are measured at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in the period in which the liability is incurred. In the normal course of business, Infor may incur restructuring charges related to personnel which are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits. These restructuring charges represent severance associated with redundant positions. When estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activities, assumptions are applied regarding estimated sub-lease payments to be received, which can differ materially from actual results. This may require revision of initial estimates which may materially affect our results of operations and financial position in the period the change in estimate occurs.\nWe estimate the amounts of these costs based on our expectations at the time the charges are taken and we reevaluate the remaining accruals at each reporting date based on current facts and circumstances. If our estimates or expectations change because we are subjected to contractual obligations or negotiations we did not anticipate, we choose to further restructure our operations, or there are other costs or changes we did not foresee, we adjust the restructuring accruals in the period that our estimates change. Such changes are recorded as increases or decreases to the restructuring related charges in our results of operations.\nValuation of Accounts Receivable\nWe have established an allowance for estimated billing adjustments and an allowance for estimated amounts that will not be collected. We record provisions for billing adjustments as a reduction of revenue and provisions for doubtful accounts as a component of general and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. We review specific accounts, including significant accounts with balances past due over 90 days, for collectability based on circumstances known at the date of the financial statements.\nIn judging the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience, the general economic environment, the need for specific customer reserves and the aging of our receivables. To assess the need for specific customer reserves, we evaluate the probability of collection based upon several factors including: 1) third-party credit agency information, 2) customer financial statements and/or 3) customer payment history. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors. If the factors used in determining the allowance do not reflect future events, then a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be necessary at the time of determination. Such a change may have a significant impact on our future results of operations. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when we determine it is probable the receivable will not be recovered.\nValuation and Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nOur goodwill and intangible assets resulted primarily from our acquisitions. We account for intangible assets and goodwill pursuant to ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we review these assets for impairment or disposal. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or a significant adverse change in the business climate in which we operate. In order to perform these reviews we must first determine our reporting units in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. ASC 280 requires a public enterprise to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments, and thus its reporting units. We have determined that we operate as three reporting units: License, Maintenance and Consulting.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. We have adopted the FASB guidance that allows for an initial qualitative analysis to assess potential goodwill impairment prior to performing the two-step impairment test. Our annual testing for goodwill impairment begins with a qualitative comparison of a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying value to determine if it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value is less than the carrying value and thus whether any further two-step impairment tests are necessary. If further two-step impairment testing is necessary, the first step is used to identify potential impairment and compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If our carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test would be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of impairment loss and compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess. Any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. After a goodwill impairment loss is recognized, the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is the new accounting basis. A subsequent reversal of a previously recognized goodwill impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed and the loss has been recognized.\nIndex to Financial Statements The estimate of the total fair value of our reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projections of future cash flows and discount rates. The discount rate utilized is based on management's best estimate of the related risks and return at the time the impairment assessment is made. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30. The results of our most recent annual tests performed in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 did not indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill and we have no accumulated impairment charges related to our goodwill.\nThe carrying amount of our intangible assets, other than acquired technology, are reviewed whenever circumstances arise that indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of our acquired technology is reviewed for recoverability on at least an annual basis. The carrying value of our intangible assets is compared to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate. An asset is considered to be impaired if the carrying value of that asset exceeds its estimated fair value and this difference is recognized as an impairment loss. The estimated fair value of these intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projections of future cash flows and remaining useful lives of the intangible assets. We have not recognized any losses from impairment of our intangible assets during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nIncome Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nOur provision for income taxes consists of provisions for federal, state, and foreign income taxes. We operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, our combined income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting our operating results in various locations and the applicable rates.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Our judgments, assumptions, and estimates relative to the provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws, and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the final tax outcome of matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals. Such differences, if identified in future periods, could have a material effect on the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in ASC 740 Income Taxes. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates that are applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized to the differences between the financial statements carrying amount and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in net loss (or net income) in the period in which the tax rate change is enacted. The statement also requires a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.\nOur worldwide net deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, disallowed interest expense carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income (loss) on our tax returns and income (loss) before income taxes under GAAP, primarily related to goodwill and intangible assets. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes. We maintain certain strategic management and operational activities in overseas subsidiaries and our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are generally lower than in the U.S. As of April 30, 2016, we did not provide for U.S. federal income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely.\nA valuation allowance is recognized for a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. as well as certain foreign tax jurisdictions. This valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of these assets. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence. This evidence includes historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. Projected future taxable income is based on our expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. We expect to continue to provide a valuation allowance against these assets until, or unless, we can sustain a level of profitability in the respective tax jurisdictions that demonstrates our ability to utilize these assets. At that time, the valuation allowance could be reduced in part or in total.\nWe are subject to the provisions of ASC 740-10, which defines the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing thresholds and attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. This standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure. The amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. Our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for\nIndex to Financial Statements\nour uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, judicial rulings and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made.\nThe provisions of ASC 740-10 contain a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes line of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company is included in the GGC Software Parent, Inc. consolidated federal income tax return. The Company and its subsidiaries provide for income taxes under the separate return method, by which Infor, Inc. and its subsidiaries compute tax expense as though they file a separate company tax return.\nContingencies-Litigation Reserves\nWe may, from time to time, have unresolved regulatory, legal, tax or other matters. We provide for contingent liabilities in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies. Pursuant to this guidance, a loss contingency is charged to income when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure in the notes to the financial statements is required for loss contingencies that do not meet both conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized. We expense all legal costs to resolve regulatory, legal, tax, or other matters in the period incurred.\nPeriodically, at a minimum at each reporting date, we review the status of each significant matter to assess our potential financial exposure. If a potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated as defined by the guidance related to accounting for contingencies, we reflect the estimated loss in our results of operations. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability can be reasonably estimated. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available to us at that time. Further, estimates of this nature are highly subjective, and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nLitigation by its nature is uncertain and the determination of whether any particular case involves a probable loss and quantifying the amount of loss for purposes of establishing or adjusting applicable reserves requires us to exercise considerable judgment, which is applied as of a certain date. The required reserves may change in the future due to new matters, developments in existing matters, or if we determine to change our strategy with respect to the resolution of any particular matter.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity-based payments, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock and other equity-based awards, in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires that equity-based payments (to the extent they are compensatory) be recognized in our results of operations based on their fair values and the estimated number of securities we ultimately expect will vest.\nWe utilize the Option-Pricing Method to estimate the fair value of our equity awards. This approach models the various classes of equity securities as a series of call options on our total equity. The exercise prices of the call options are derived based on the distribution waterfall of the issuing entity. Assumptions utilized under the Option-Pricing Method include: (a) stock price, derived from the estimated fair value of our total equity, (b) time to expiration, derived from the expected time to a potential liquidity event, (c) risk- free interest rate, derived from the U.S. Treasury rate over the expected time to expiration, (d) expected dividend yield and (e) expected volatility of the total equity value.\nCircumstances may change and additional data may become available over time which could result in changes to these input assumptions and our estimates of the number of securities we expect will vest. Such changes could materially impact our fair value estimates and how much we recognize as equity-based compensation.\nAs more fully described in Note 16, Share Purchase and Option Plans, certain stock options, restricted stock and other equity-based awards outstanding under our Share Purchase and Option Plans are subject to vesting and repurchase features that function as in-substance forfeiture provisions. The repurchase features are removed only following the Company's election not to exercise such repurchase rights within a certain period of time following the termination of the recipient's employment. If the exercise of the Company's repurchase rights is considered probable as of a given reporting date, no compensation costs are recognized for securities subject to these repurchase features in that period.\nIndex to Financial Statements Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth certain line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as reported in conformity with GAAP, the period-over-period actual percentage change (Actual) and the period-over-period constant currency percentage change (Constant Currency) for the periods indicated. With the change in our fiscal year, we have presented our results of operations for fiscal 2016 (12 months) compared to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported. In addition, to facilitate comparisons to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported, we have presented the similar unaudited 11-month period as recast for fiscal 2014 (June 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014).\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

We generate revenues from licensing our software, providing access to our software through SaaS subscriptions, providing product updates and support related to our licensed products and providing consulting services. We utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products, product updates and support and consulting services are sold to our customers. As our product updates and support and consulting services are primarily attributable to our licensed products, growth in our product updates and support and consulting services is generally tied to the level of our license contracting activity.\nTotal revenues increased by 15.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5.1%. On a constant currency basis, revenues in each category increased including a 32.5% increase in our software license fees and subscriptions, primarily our SaaS revenues as we continue to expand our CloudSuite offerings and shift our license mix to SaaS subscriptions, a 10.4% increase in our product updates and support fees, as well as a 13.0% increase in our consulting services and other fees revenues. The increase in total revenues also reflects the inclusion of the results of operations of GT Nexus since the acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis the May 2015 impact on total revenues was an increase of 9.1 points and the other 11 months of fiscal 2016 resulted in an increase of 6.4 points.\nTotal revenues increased by 3.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 recast, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 4.2%. On a constant currency basis, the increase was due primarily to growth in our software license fees and subscriptions revenues, which were up 17.7%. We realized growth in our software license fees and subscriptions revenues across all geographic regions primarily due to continued momentum in our SaaS subscription and CloudeSuite offerings. In fiscal 2015 we continued to see traction in the higher growth products where we have made investments over the past three years and with our SaaS subscription offerings. On a constant currency basis our product updates and support fees revenues were also up 2.5% across all regions. These increases were somewhat offset by a year-over-year decrease of 2.1% in our consulting services and other fees revenues as demand for our consulting services continues to be lower globally.\nIndex to Financial Statements Software License Fees and Subscriptions. Our software license fees and subscriptions primarily consist of fees resulting from products licensed to customers on a perpetual basis and subscription revenues related to our SaaS offerings. Product license fees result from a customer's licensing of a given software product for the first time or with a customer's licensing of additional users for previously licensed products.\nFiscal 2016 software license fees and subscriptions revenues increased by 32.5% compared to fiscal 2015, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency rate impact of 4.0%. At constant currency, we reported higher subscriptions revenues for fiscal 2016 which contributed an increase of 28.8 points. The increase in subscriptions revenues was experienced across all geographic regions, especially in the Americas, as we continued to see strong demand for our expanding CloudSuite and other subscription offerings. The increase in subscriptions revenues in fiscal 2016 also reflects the inclusion of the results of GT Nexus, acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, with no related amounts in the corresponding prior period. GT Nexus contributed 13.9 points of the increase. The impact of May 2015 subscriptions revenues was an increase of approximately 2.7 points while the remaining 11 months' subscriptions revenues accounted for a 26.1 point increase. Higher license fees revenues accounted for 3.7 points of the increase, with increases in the Americas and EMEA regions more than offsetting a decrease in our APAC region. May 2015 software license fees accounted for approximately 5.1 points of the year-to-date increase while the remaining 11 months' software license fees resulted in a decrease of 1.3 points. We continued to see a shift in our software license business from the sale of perpetual licenses to the sale of SaaS subscriptions, which negatively impacts our perpetual license fees revenues. Revenue from perpetual licensing transactions is generally recorded up-front, while revenue from SaaS transactions is recognized over the term of the subscription contract.\nFor fiscal 2015, license fees and subscriptions revenues increased by 17.7% compared to fiscal 2014 recast, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5.7%. At constant currency, the increase was due to higher subscriptions revenues, which contributed 9.9 points of the increase and includes the results of our recent acquisitions, primarily PeopleAnswers. In fiscal 2015 we increased the volume and the average deal size of our SaaS transactions. In addition, license fees revenues accounted for 7.8 points of the increase. The year-to-date increase was across all of our geographic regions. The total number of perpetual licensing transactions for fiscal 2015 was relatively flat compared to last year, however we had an increase of over 18.8% in transactions with total contract values greater than $250,000. The increase in license fees was also benefitted by the change in our fiscal year, which drove the focus of our fourth quarter quarterly sales cycle to April 30 in fiscal 2015 compared to May 31 in fiscal 2014.\nProduct Updates and Support Fees. Our product updates and support fees revenues represent the ratable recognition of fees to enroll and renew on-premise licensed products in our maintenance programs. These fees are typically charged annually and are based on the on-premise license fees initially paid by the customer. Product updates and support revenues can fluctuate based on the number and timing of new on-premise license contracts, renewal rates and price increases.\nFor fiscal 2016, product updates and support fees increased by 10.4%, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 4.7%, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in product updates and support fees was across all geographic regions. At constant currency, the increase was primarily the result of the impact of May 2015, which accounted for an increase of approximately 9.6 points. Product updates and support fees were relatively flat for the other 11 months of fiscal 2016, accounting for a 0.8 point increase, as revenues related to new maintenance pull-through from new on-premise license transactions and price increases offset customer attrition and decreases related to customers converting from on-premise maintenance to our SaaS subscription offerings. We continue to experience maintenance retention rates of over 93.0%.\nProduct updates and support fees increased by 2.5%, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 3.3%, in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 recast. The increase was primarily the result of revenues related to new maintenance pull-through from new on-premise license transactions and price increases offsetting customer attrition. In addition, fiscal 2015 was favorably impacted by the inclusion of the results of our recent acquisitions, primarily Saleslogix.\nConsulting Services and Other Fees. Our consulting services and other fees revenues consist primarily of software-related services, including systems implementation and integration services, consulting, custom modification, hosting services, application managed services and education and training services for customers who have licensed our products. Consulting services and other fees revenues also includes revenues related to hardware systems products and Inforum, our customer event.\nConsulting services and other fees increased by 13.0%, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 6.5%, in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. At constant currency, our consulting services revenues were up across all geographic regions and accounted for an increase of 11.8 points with the Americas, EMEA and APAC accounting for increases of approximately 7.3, 4.0 and 0.5 points, respectively. In addition, our other fees revenues increased by 1.2 points compared to fiscal 2015. The May 2015 impact on consulting services and other fees revenues was an increase of approximately 8.7 points and the other 11 months of fiscal 2016 accounted for an increase of 4.3 points.\nIndex to Financial Statements Fiscal 2015 consulting services and other fees decreased by 2.1%, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 4.9%, compared to fiscal 2014 recast. At constant currency, the decrease in consulting services revenues was experienced in all of our regions with EMEA, APAC and Americas accounting for decreases of approximately 1.4, 1.1 and 0.7 points, respectively, compared to last year. These decreases were somewhat offset by a 1.0 point increase in other fees primarily related to the timing of Inforum, our annual customer event, which was held in September during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 with no amounts recorded in the fiscal 2014 recast period as our previous Inforum event was held in April 2013.\nDeferred Revenue. Certain of our revenues are deferred when all conditions of revenue recognition have not been met. Deferred revenue represents revenue that is to be recognized in future periods when such conditions have been satisfied related to certain license agreements (including SaaS), maintenance contracts and certain consulting arrangements, as discussed above. We had total deferred revenues of $973.9 million and $894.1 million at April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the components of deferred revenue:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in millions) </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software license fees and subscriptions\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product updates and support fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>757.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>754.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consulting services and other fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total deferred revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>973.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>894.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: current portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>936.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>867.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred revenue-non-current\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Within our fiscal year, changes in the balance of our deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance services renewal cycles. Our peak renewal activity levels occur in December and May with revenues being recognized ratably over the applicable service periods. We generate substantial recurring product update and support fees revenue from our customer support programs and other software maintenance services. Maintaining our current level of product update and support fees revenue is dependent upon our ability to enroll our customers in our maintenance programs and having our customers renew their maintenance agreements, primarily on an annual basis. Deferred SaaS subscription revenues are a growing part of our deferred software license fees and subscriptions balance and are less cyclical than the balance of our deferred product updates and support fees revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Statements Cost of Software License Fees and Subscriptions. Cost of software license fees and subscriptions reflects costs related to the sale of our software licenses including royalties to third parties, channel partner commissions and other software delivery expenses, and costs related to our SaaS offerings including salaries, employee benefits, vendor costs associated with providing our subscription offerings, and applicable overhead costs. Our software solutions may include embedded components of third-party vendors for which a fee is paid to the vendor upon the sale of our products. In addition, we resell third-party products in conjunction with the license of our software solutions, which also results in a fee. We also sell our software solutions through our third-party channel relationships which require us to pay applicable commissions to our channel partners. The cost of software license fees and subscriptions is generally higher, as a percentage of revenues, when we sell products of third-party vendors. As a result, software license fees and subscriptions gross margins will vary depending on the proportion of third-party product sales and/or sales through our business partner channel in our revenue mix.\nCost of license fees and subscriptions for fiscal 2016 increased by 59.0%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 3.8%, compared to fiscal 2015. At constant currency, this increase was primarily due to a 49.2 point increase related to higher SaaS costs in-line with higher subscriptions revenues, a 6.3 point increase related to higher third-party royalties, a 2.7 point increase related to higher channel partner commissions, and a 0.8 point increase in other costs. The impact of May 2015 on cost of license fees and subscriptions was an increase of approximately 6.4 points.\nFiscal 2015 cost of license fees and subscriptions increased by 37.5%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 3.6%, compared to fiscal 2014 recast. At constant currency, this increase was primarily due to a 32.0 point increase related to higher SaaS costs in line with our higher revenues. In addition, we recorded higher channel partner commissions and third-party royalties which accounted for increases of 8.3 and 0.9 points, respectively, again in-line with our higher revenues in fiscal 2015. These increases were somewhat offset by a 3.7 point decrease related to other costs.\nCost of Product Updates and Support Fees. Cost of product updates and support fees includes salaries, employee benefits, related travel, third-party maintenance costs associated with embedded and non-embedded third-party products, related channel partner commissions, and the overhead costs of providing our customers product updates and support.\nFor fiscal 2016, cost of product updates and support fees increased by 10.0%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 5.5%, compared to fiscal 2015. At constant currency, the increase was primarily due to a 6.1 point increase related to higher third-party royalties, a 2.7 point increase related to higher professional fees, a 0.8 point increase in employee-related support costs and overhead allocations, and a 0.4 point increase due to higher channel partner commissions. The impact of May 2015 on cost of product updates and support fees was an increase of approximately 9.3 points.\nFiscal 2015 cost of product updates and support fees increased by 3.0%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 3.4%, compared to the corresponding prior period. At constant currency, the increase was primarily due to a 2.0 point increase related to higher channel partner commissions, a 1.9 point increase related to higher professional fees, and a 0.6 point increase related to higher third-party royalties. These increases were somewhat offset by a 1.5 point decrease in employee-related costs and related overhead allocations due to lower headcount in our customer support organization in fiscal 2015 compared to last year.\nCost of Consulting Services and Other Fees. Cost of consulting services and other fees includes salaries, employee benefits, third-party consulting costs, related travel, and the overhead costs of providing our customers systems implementation and integration services, consulting, custom modification, hosting services, application managed services and education and training services. Cost of consulting services and other fees also includes costs associated with our hardware business.\nFor fiscal 2016, cost of consulting services and other fees increased by 18.4%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 7.4%, compared to fiscal 2015. At constant currency, cost of consulting services increased 14.0 points due to higher employee-related costs and overhead allocations, a 2.6 point increase related to higher billable employee costs, and a 1.8 point increase related to an increase in other costs. The impact of May 2015 on cost of consulting services and other fees was an increase of approximately 9.7 points.\nFor fiscal 2015, cost of consulting services and other fees decreased by 1.4%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 4.7%, compared to the corresponding prior period. At constant currency, the decrease was primarily due to a 0.9 point decrease in employee costs and related overhead allocations due to lower headcount in our professional services organizations, a 0.3 point decrease due to lower professional fees, and 0.6 points related to a decrease in other service costs. These decreases were somewhat offset by a 0.2 point increase in billable employee costs and a 0.2 point increase related to our hosting services costs.\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, employee benefits, travel, trade show activities, advertising and branding costs, overhead costs related to our sales and marketing functions, and the costs of Inforum, our customer event.\nIndex to Financial Statements For fiscal 2016, sales and marketing expenses increased by 9.3%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 4.3%, compared to fiscal 2015. On a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expenses increased 9.7 points due to higher employee-related sales costs and related overhead allocations and 0.3 points due to an increase in other sales costs. These increases were somewhat offset by a 0.7 point decrease related to lower marketing program costs. The impact of May 2015 on sales and marketing expenses was an increase of approximately 8.3 points.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by 5.6%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 3.2%, in fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014 recast. On a constant currency basis, sales and marketing expenses increased 3.3 points due to an increase in our marketing program costs primarily related to our September 2014 Inforum customer conference. In addition, 2.3 points relate to increased employee-related costs and overhead allocations. The increase in employee-related costs included an increase in salaries and commission costs which were somewhat offset by a decrease in equity-based compensation.\nResearch and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenditures, third-party consulting and professional services, and overhead costs related to our research and development function.\nFor fiscal 2016, research and development expenses increased by 18.0%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 4.0%, compared to fiscal 2015. On a constant currency basis, research and development expenses increased 16.0 points as a result of higher employee-related costs and related overhead allocations due to higher headcount in our development organization, 6.9 points related to higher professional fees, 2.1 points related to higher share-based compensation, and 0.6 points related to an increase in other development costs. These increases were somewhat offset by a 7.6 point decrease related to higher capitalization of software development costs in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The impact of May 2015 on research and development expenses was an increase of approximately 9.9 points.\nResearch and development expenses increased 6.8%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 3.2%, in fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014 recast. On a constant currency basis, research and development expenses increased 4.2 points due to an increase in professional fees, 2.8 points as a result of higher employee-related costs and 0.6 points in overhead allocations. The increase in employee-related costs included an increase in salaries which was somewhat offset by a decrease in equity-based compensation. These increases were somewhat offset by a 0.8 point decrease related to other development costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenditures for information technology, finance, legal and human resources support functions.\nFor fiscal 2016, general and administrative expenses increased by 16.0%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 7.3%, compared to fiscal 2015. On a constant currency basis, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 11.3 points due to higher employee-related costs and related overhead allocations, 4.4 points related to higher consulting and professional fees, and 6.0 points related to an increase in other general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 4.7 points due to lower legal settlement costs incurred in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 and 1.0 points due to lower share-based compensation. The impact of May 2015 on general and administrative expenses was an increase of approximately 9.3 points.\nFiscal 2015 general and administrative expenses increased by 6.8%, excluding the favorable foreign currency impact of 4.7%, compared to fiscal 2014 recast. On a constant currency basis, general and administrative expenses increased approximately 8.6 points due to higher legal settlement costs incurred in fiscal 2015 compared to the reversal, recorded in the second quarter last year, of the accrual we had recorded related to certain patent litigation matters (see Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies- Litigation, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, higher premise cost accounted for a 0.9 point increase, and an increase in other general and administrative expenses accounted for 1.6 points. These increases were partially offset by a 3.0 point decrease related to consulting and professional fees, primarily due to lower legal fees, and lower employee-related costs and overhead allocations of 1.3 points.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets and Depreciation. Amortization of intangible assets primarily relates to the on-going amortization of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions. Depreciation expense relates primarily to our computer equipment and purchased software, furniture and fixtures as well as amortization of leasehold improvements.\nFiscal 2016 amortization of intangible assets and depreciation increased by 13.0%, excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency of 3.6%, compared to fiscal 2015. The increase resulted primarily from the impact of May 2015, which accounted for an increase of approximately 9.6 points, as well as higher amortization expense related to intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets recorded as part of the GT Nexus Acquisition. These increases were somewhat offset by lower amortization related to certain of our assets being fully amortized or depreciated in fiscal 2016 with no corresponding expense recorded in fiscal 2015.\nFiscal 2015 amortization of intangible assets and depreciation decreased by 5.0%, excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency of 2.7%, compared with fiscal 2014 recast. The decrease resulted primarily from certain of our intangible assets being fully amortized in fiscal 2014 recast with no corresponding expense recorded in fiscal 2015, somewhat offset by additional amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded as part of our recent acquisitions.\nIndex to Financial Statements Restructuring. We have recorded restructuring charges related to our acquisitions and on occasion to eliminate redundancies, improve our operational efficiency and reduce our operating costs. These cost reduction measures included workforce reductions relating to restructuring our workforce, the exiting of certain leased facilities and the consolidation of space in certain other facilities. These restructuring charges include employee severance costs and costs related to the reduction of office space. See Note 11, Restructuring Charges, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn fiscal 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $28.0 million compared to $5.7 million in fiscal 2015 and $12.8 million in fiscal 2014 recast. The restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2016 were related to employee severance costs for personnel in all functions and across all geographies as well as charges related to exiting or consolidating space in certain leased facilities. During fiscal 2016, we engaged an outside consulting firm to provide restructuring advisory services focusing on all areas of our operations. These efforts resulted in the charges taken in fiscal 2016. The restructuring charges recorded in fiscal 2015 were related to employee severance costs for personnel in our sales and professional services organizations primarily in our EMEA region as well as personnel in our product development organization primarily in our APAC region. The fiscal 2014 restructuring charges were primarily for employee severance costs related to actions taken in our professional services and sales organizations in our EMEA region.\nAcquisition-Related and Other Costs. Acquisition-related and other costs include transaction and integration costs related to our acquisitions, including professional services fees, certain employee costs related to transitional and certain other employees, as well as changes to the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to our acquisitions. Acquisition-related and other costs also include certain costs incurred in financing our acquisitions, reorganizing our operations and other debt financing activities.\nFiscal 2016 acquisition-related and other costs of $17.1 million increased by approximately $15.7 million compared to $1.4 million in fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016, acquisition-related and other costs were primarily for the GT Nexus Acquisition in September 2015, adjustments to the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liability related to previous acquisitions, costs related to our investment in LogicBlox-Predictix Holdings, Inc. (Predictix), as well as costs of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 that we filed with the SEC (Form S-4) related to the Exchange Offer (as defined below). See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt, below.\nFiscal 2015 acquisition-related and other costs of $1.4 million decreased by approximately $25.9 million compared to $27.3 million in fiscal 2014 recast. Fiscal 2015 acquisition-related and other costs related primarily to costs incurred for our recent acquisitions, primarily Saleslogix, as well as cost related to changing our fiscal year end. These costs were somewhat offset by adjustments to the estimated fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities related to prior period acquisitions. For fiscal 2014, acquisition-related and other costs related primarily to our refinancing activities during the year as well as costs incurred related to our acquisition of PeopleAnswers.\nNon-Operating Income and Expenses\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

</td> <td>NM Percentage not meaningful </td> </tr>\n</table> Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net consists of the interest expense related to our debt less the interest income on cash and marketable securities.\nFiscal 2016 interest expense, net of $311.5 million decreased by $8.6 million, or 2.7%, compared to $320.1 million in fiscal 2015. The decrease in our interest expense was primarily due to the refinancing of our Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 at more favorable interest rates somewhat offset by interest on our Senior Secured Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt, below. As a result of these refinancing transactions, our interest expense decreased by approximately $19.3 million. This decrease was somewhat offset by $10.8 million of additional interest related to our interest rate swaps. The May 2015 impact on interest expense, net was an unfavorable $24.4 million and the other 11 months of fiscal 2016 was a favorable $33.0 million, for a net favorable impact of $8.6 million.\nIndex to Financial Statements Fiscal 2015 interest expense, net of $320.1 million decreased by $28.3 million, or 8.1%, compared to $348.4 million in fiscal 2014 recast. The decrease was primarily due to the refinancing of our term loans under our Credit Agreement in fiscal 2014 and the refinancing of our senior notes in April 2015 at favorable interest rates which resulted in a $28.3 million decrease in our interest expense. In addition, the amortization of deferred financing fees decreased $2.8 million from fiscal 2014 recast. These decreases were somewhat offset by a $1.8 million increase in the amortization of debt discounts and $1.0 million in additional interest related to our interest rate swaps.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt consists of redemption premiums paid, the net book value of deferred financing fees and debt discounts written off, and other costs incurred in connection with our refinancing activities. See Note 12, Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $172.4 million related to the refinancing of our existing senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. This amount includes $134.7 million in applicable redemption premiums on our existing senior notes, $34.8 million related to the net book value of deferred financing fees and debt discounts written off, and $2.9 million in other costs incurred in connection with the repayment of our existing senior notes.\nThe $5.2 million loss on extinguishment of debt recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the amendments to our Credit Agreement refinancing our then outstanding term loans. This amount represents the net book value of deferred financing fees written off in connection with our refinancing transactions during the first and third quarters of fiscal 2014 for those lenders whose participation was treated as an extinguishment rather than a modification of the related debt.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net consists of the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, gain/loss on the sale of fixed assets, and other costs.\nFiscal 2016 other (income) expense, net was net expense of $75.9 million compared to net income of $66.8 million in fiscal 2015 and $52.0 million in fiscal 2014 recast. These changes in other (income) expense, net were primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to the Euro and British Pound. In fiscal 2016, the May 2015 impact on other (income) expense was a favorable $19.4 million and the other 11 months of fiscal 2016 was an unfavorable $162.0 million, for a net unfavorable impact of $142.7 million.\nIncome Tax Provision (Benefit)\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2016 vs. </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 Months Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 Months Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 Months Ended April 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in millions, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Actual </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Currency </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(unaudited) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(recast) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax provision (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(48.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(52.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.5 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.7 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>312.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>NM Percentage not meaningful </td> </tr>\n</table> The effective tax rate for the periods presented is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of changes in the forecasted annual income level and geographical mix of our operating earnings as well as a result of acquisitions, changes in liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits, changes in the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, tax settlements with U.S. and foreign tax authorities, and the impact from changes in enacted tax laws.\nOur provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, states taxes, and foreign earnings taxed at lower income tax rates than in the U.S.\nFor fiscal 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $48.8 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 312.8%. The change in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 was driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance for various foreign deferred tax assets, a reduction in tax expense as a result of various U.S. Federal and State research and development tax credits, a reduction in the foreign tax rate benefit from differential tax rates due to a change in our mix of earnings and an increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.\nFor fiscal 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $52.2 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 160.6%. The change in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was driven by a reduction in foreign earnings subject to U.S. taxes (Subpart F income), a reduction in non-deductible stock compensation, the ability to utilize the benefits of IRC Section 199 for domestic manufacturing, and a reduction in various permanent taxable income addbacks.\nIndex to Financial Statements For fiscal 2014, we recorded income tax expense of $12.6 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 9.4%. The change in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in foreign earnings subject to lower tax rates, the elimination of the requirement to provide additional valuation allowance for IRC Section 163(j) interest disallowance, the release of foreign related valuation allowances due to the increase in foreign earnings and various foreign entity restructurings, the elimination of the need to provide for a valuation allowance for certain foreign earnings, and a reduction in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits due to the lapse of statutes for various exposures.\nDuring fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016, we executed multiple legal entity organizational restructuring actions to streamline and simplify business operations, lower backoffice costs, and provide access to various foreign deferred tax assets. As a result of such actions, various foreign valuation allowances were able to be eliminated during fiscal 2014, 2015 and 2016. In fiscal 2016, we released the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the Netherlands based on the removal of negative evidence related to the entities' most recent three years of operating results, as well as the execution of a tax planning strategy. During fiscal 2016, we completed certain tax planning strategies in the Netherlands which resulted in the release of a $51.5 million valuation allowance relating to certain net operating losses and deferred tax assets. During fiscal 2016, we continued to examine various tax structuring alternatives that may be executed during fiscal 2017 which could provide additional positive evidence in our valuation allowance considerations.\nInfor is included in the GGC Software Parent, Inc. consolidated federal income tax return. The Company and its subsidiaries provided for income taxes under the separate return method, by which Infor, Inc. and its subsidiaries compute tax expense as though they file a separate tax return. GGC Software Parent, Inc. and Infor Software Parent LLC have entered into a tax allocation agreement (Tax Allocation Agreement) with the Company that was effective as of April 5, 2012. The Tax Allocation Agreement sets forth the obligation of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries with regard to preparing and filing tax returns and allocating tax payments under the consolidated reporting rules of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and local tax laws governing combined or consolidated filings. The Tax Allocation Agreement provides that each domestic subsidiary that is a member of the consolidated, unitary or combined tax group will pay its share of the taxes of the group. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and fiscal 2014, we made cash payments of $17.6 million, $11.7 million and $11.5 million, respectively, to GGC Software Parent, Inc. under the terms of the Tax Allocation Agreement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur results of operations in this Management's Discussion and Analysis are presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with GAAP, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Adjusted EBITDA as defined in our credit agreements and the indentures that govern our senior notes, and Adjusted EBITDA margin. We believe our presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful insight into our operating performance and an alternative perspective of our results of operations. We use these non-GAAP measures to assess our operating performance, to develop budgets and to serve as a measurement for incentive compensation awards. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement of our operating performance as per the financial covenants in our debt agreements. Presentation of these non-GAAP measures allows users to review our results of operations from the same perspective as management and our Board of Directors. These non-GAAP financial measures provide users an enhanced understanding of our operations, facilitate analysis and comparisons of our current and past results of operations, facilitate comparisons of our operating results with those of our competitors and provide insight into the prospects of our future performance. We also believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to users because they provide supplemental information that research analysts, investment bankers and lenders frequently use to analyze software companies including those that have recently made significant acquisitions. Additionally, certain non-GAAP disclosures are required by our lenders in our reporting to them.\nThe method we use to produce non-GAAP financial measures is not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from the methods used by other companies reporting similar measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a substitute for the corresponding GAAP measures but instead should be utilized as supplemental measures of operating performance in evaluating our business. Non-GAAP measures do have limitations in that they do not reflect certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be viewed in conjunction with both our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and the reconciliation of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures presented below.\nIndex to Financial Statements Non-GAAP Revenues\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of our non-GAAP revenues to our GAAP

our reported GAAP revenues are primarily related to purchase accounting and other acquisition matters. These amounts reflect adjustments to increase software license fees and subscriptions, product updates and support fees, and consulting services and other fees that we would have recognized if we had not adjusted acquired deferred revenues to their fair values as required by GAAP. Certain deferred revenue for software license fees and subscriptions, product updates and support fees, and consulting services and other fees on the acquired entity's balance sheet, at the time of the acquisition, were eliminated from our GAAP results as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition as they do not reflect the fair value of performance obligations to us. As a result, our GAAP results do not, in management's view, reflect all of our software license fees and subscriptions, product updates and support fees, and consulting services and other fees. We believe the presentation of non-GAAP revenues provides investors and other external users a helpful alternative view of our operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table presents the

adjustments we make to our reported GAAP net income attributable to Infor to get to Adjusted EBITDA include certain non-operating expenses and non-cash charges that are allowed to be added back under the provisions of our debt agreements. These adjustments eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance or that may vary from period to period without any correlation to the results of our core operations. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides investors and other external users a supplemental measure of our performance and a helpful alternative view of our operations. In addition, the reporting of Adjusted EBITDA is a requirement of our debt agreements.\nWhile Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric that is frequently used by our lenders, analysts and others in their evaluation of our performance, it has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our GAAP results as reported. For example, Adjusted EBITDA excludes a number of significant cash and non-cash recurring items including but not limited to interest paid on our debt, income tax payments, the amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of capitalized tangible assets used in generating revenues in our business, and share-based compensation expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nTable

is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their subscriptions for licensed software updates (maintenance) and product support agreements. Payments from customers for these maintenance and support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts' terms, which are generally one year in length. We also generate significant cash from new software license sales and, to a lesser extent, consulting and other services. Our primary uses of cash for operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures. We also make significant cash payments related to interest payments, taxes and leased facilities. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 we have also undertaken significant investing and financing activities related to our acquisitions and the refinancing of our long-term debt. We are highly leveraged and our liquidity requirements are significant, primarily due to debt service requirements.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may use cash to acquire additional companies or products from time-to-time to enhance our product lines and expand our customer base, which could have a material effect on our capital resources. In fiscal 2016, we completed one acquisition for a purchase price of $549.9 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2015, we completed one acquisition for a purchase price of $30.1 million, net of cash acquired. In fiscal 2014, we completed two acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $202.0 million, net of cash acquired. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndex to Financial Statements As of each of our reported balance sheet dates, we have reported a deficit in working capital. This deficit in working capital represents an excess of our current liabilities over our current assets and is primarily the result of the significant balance of deferred revenue, reported as a current liability, at each balance sheet date. Our deferred revenues represent the excess of our collections from, or our billings due from our customers, for which the related revenues have not yet met all the criteria necessary to be recognized as earned in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition above for a further description of those criteria.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations, together with our cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, and investments for fiscal 2017 and for the foreseeable future. At some point in the future we may require additional funds for either operating or strategic purposes and may seek to raise the additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. If we ever need to seek additional financing, there is no assurance that this additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on reasonable terms. If our liquidity and capital resources are insufficient to meet our requirements or fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems, may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 was $419.1 million. Our net income adjusted for non-cash items provided $316.0 million in cash due to strong cash flows from operations, and changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $103.1 million. The operating assets and liabilities sources of cash related primarily to a $107.5 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily due to an increase in accrued interest due to the timing of debt payments and an increase in accounts payable, and a $58.6 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to increased deferred SaaS revenue. The sources of cash were partially offset by a $38.2 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily due to the timing of certain of our significant service agreements, and a $32.3 million increase in accounts receivable, net.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2015 was $208.2 million. Our net income adjusted for non-cash items provided $322.6 million in cash due to strong cash flows from operations, while changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $114.4 million. The operating assets and liabilities uses of cash related primarily to a $68.1 million decrease in deferred revenue, primarily due to decreased deferred maintenance resulting from the timing of our maintenance renewals in May, and a $39.8 million decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily due to a decrease in accrued interest related to the recent refinancing of our senior notes. The uses of cash were partially offset by a $29.4 million decrease in accounts receivable, net.\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2014 was $414.6 million. Our net income adjusted for non-cash items provided $380.4 million in cash due to strong cash flows from operations, and changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $34.2 million. The operating assets and liabilities sources of cash related to a $28.9 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily due to increased deferred SaaS revenue as well as increased deferred maintenance, and a $19.9 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily due to an increase in accrued interest. The sources of cash were partially offset by a $29.5 million change in income tax receivable/payable.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $641.4 million in fiscal 2016. The primary uses of cash were $549.6 million net cash used for the GT Nexus Acquisition, $65.5 million used to purchase property, equipment and software, and $25.0 million for our investment in Predictix.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $48.7 million in fiscal 2015. The primary uses of cash were $35.7 million used to purchase property, equipment and software, and $30.1 million net cash used for our acquisitions, partially offset by $17.1 million decrease in restricted cash.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $251.7 million in fiscal 2014. The primary uses of cash were $199.7 million net cash used for our acquisitions, $32.5 million used to purchase property, equipment and software and a $19.5 million increase in restricted cash.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $402.5 million in fiscal 2016. The source of cash was $495.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of debt in connection with the GT Nexus Acquisition. This was partially offset by uses of cash, primarily $35.0 million in dividend payments, $34.2 million in debt repayments, and $16.5 million in deferred financing fees related to the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes.\nIndex to Financial Statements Net cash used in financing activities was $158.2 million in fiscal 2015. The primary uses of cash were $1,932.5 million in debt repayments including the outstanding balances of our senior notes in April 2015, $168.7 million in fees paid relating to our refinancing transactions during the fiscal year including approximately $137.7 million in early redemption premiums and other fees related to the repayment of our existing senior notes and $31.0 million that we capitalized as deferred financing fees related to the issuance of our new senior notes, and $65.7 million for dividends paid. These uses of cash were mostly offset by $2,019.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of debt related to the refinancing of our senior notes in April 2015.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $15.7 million in fiscal 2014. The primary uses of cash were $3,457.5 million in debt repayments and $37.5 million that we capitalized as deferred financing fees relating to our refinancing transactions during the year. These uses of cash were mostly offset by $3,487.7 million from the issuance of debt related to our recent refinancing transactions.\nEffect of Exchange Rate Changes\nIn fiscal 2016, changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a $1.2 million decrease in our cash and cash equivalents. In fiscal 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a $49.9 million decrease in our cash and cash equivalents. Foreign currency exchange rate changes increased our cash and cash equivalents by $6.2 million in fiscal 2014.\nWorking Capital Deficit\nOur working capital deficit, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was $208.5 million at April 30, 2016, compared to $226.4 million at April 30, 2015. At April 30, 2016, our cash increased by $179.0 million compared to the balance at April 30, 2015. Generally, increases in current assets are considered to be uses of cash and increases in current liabilities are considered to be sources of cash. During fiscal 2016, the most significant changes in our current assets, other than cash, were an increase of $53.9 million in accounts receivable, net, and a $37.3 million increase in prepaid expenses. During fiscal 2016 the most significant changes in our current liabilities included an increase in accrued expenses of $93.6 million, primarily due to an increase in accrued interest in relation to the timing of our debt payments and an increase in accrued restructuring charges, a $69.7 million increase in deferred revenue, primarily in deferred SaaS revenue, a $56.2 million increase in the current portion of our long-term debt due to the timing of payments related to our term loans, and a $54.4 million increase in accounts payable.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of April 30, 2016, we had $705.7 million in cash and cash equivalents including amounts in operating accounts, money market investments and other short-term, highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less. As of April 30, 2016, $163.7 million of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held in the U.S. The remaining $542.0 million of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held in foreign countries. Under current tax laws and regulations, if cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held outside the U.S. are distributed to the U.S. in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of these potential additional taxes due to the complexities of the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the number of jurisdictions in which we operate, the complexity of our legal entity structure, and the hypothetical nature of the calculations.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table summarizes our long-term debt balances for the periods indicated:\nTable

and the indentures that govern our senior notes.\nCredit Facilities\nOn April 5, 2012, we entered into a secured credit agreement with certain banks which consists of a secured term loan facility and a secured revolving credit facility (the Credit Agreement) which was subsequently amended pursuant to several refinancing amendments described below.\nUnder the secured term loan facility, we borrowed initial term loans having aggregate principal amounts of $2,770.0 million (the Tranche B Term Loan), $400.0 million (the Tranche B-1 Term Loan) and \u0080250.0 million (the Euro Term Loan) on April 5, 2012, each of which has been refinanced with additional term loans as described below. Interest on the term loans borrowed under the secured term loan facility is payable quarterly, in arrears. Quarterly principal payment amounts are set for each of the term loans with balloon payments at the applicable maturity dates. The term loans are subject to mandatory prepayments in the case of certain situations.\nThe secured revolving credit facility (the Revolver) has a maximum availability of $150.0 million. As of April 30, 2016, we have made no draws against the Revolver and no amounts are currently outstanding. However, $11.7 million of outstanding (undrawn) letters of credit have reduced the amount available under the Revolver to $138.3 million. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement there is an undrawn line fee of 0.50% per annum (subject to a step-down to 0.375% if our total leverage ratio is below a certain threshold) and the Revolver matures on April 5, 2017. Amounts under the Revolver may be borrowed (and reborrowed) to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes.\nAt our election, the annual interest rate applicable to the term loans and revolver borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either (a) Adjusted LIBOR (as defined below) plus an applicable margin or (b) Adjusted Base Rate (ABR-as defined below) plus an applicable margin. For purposes of the Credit Agreement, as of April 30, 2016:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Adjusted LIBOR is defined as the London interbank offered rate for the applicable currency, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements; provided, the Adjusted LIBOR for the Tranche B-3 Term Loan, Tranche B-5 Term Loan and the Euro Tranche B Term Loan will at no time be less than 1.00% per annum. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>ABR is defined as the highest of (i) the administrative agent's prime rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1.0% and (iii) one-month Adjusted LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum, provided that ABR for the Tranche B-3 and B-5 Term Loans will at no time be less than 2.00% per annum. </td> </tr>\n</table> The credit facilities are guaranteed by Infor, Inc. and certain of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (the Guarantors), and are secured by liens on substantially all of the borrower's assets and the assets of the Guarantors. Prior to the Second Amendment described below, under the Credit Agreement we were required to maintain a total leverage ratio not to exceed certain levels as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. However, pursuant to the Second Amendment, this financial maintenance covenant is applicable only for the Revolver and then only for those fiscal quarters in which we have significant borrowings under the Revolver as of the last day of such fiscal quarter. We are subject to certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants as well.\nRefinancing Amendments\nOn April 22, 2014, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended) to reflect the change in our fiscal year end from May 31 to April 30 effective June 1, 2014. No other changes were made to the terms of Credit Agreement or the related credit facilities.\nOn January 31, 2014, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended). The Fifth Amendment provides for the reduction of the interest rate margins applicable to borrowings made under our Revolver. While we have made no draws against the Revolver, interest on any future Revolver borrowings will be based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either, at our option, an Adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin of 1.75% per annum. No other changes were made to the terms of the Revolver.\nOn January 2, 2014, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended). The Fourth Amendment provided for the refinancing of all of the then outstanding balance of our Tranche B-2 Term Loan with the proceeds of a new $2,550.0 million term loan (the Tranche B-5 Term Loan). Interest on the Tranche B-5 Term Loan is based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either, at our option, an Adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, with a LIBOR floor of 1.0%, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin of 1.75% per annum, with a minimum alternative base rate floor of 2.0%. This was a reduction in our effective rate related to the new term loan as compared to the Tranche B-2 Term Loan which was based on an Adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 4.0% per annum, with an\nIndex to Financial Statements\nAdjusted LIBOR floor of 1.25% per annum. The Tranche B-5 Term Loan matures on June 3, 2020, which is an extension of approximately 26 months compared to the original Tranche B-2 Term Loan maturity date. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Tranche B-5 Term Loan is guaranteed by Infor and certain of our domestic subsidiaries, and is secured by liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantors.\nProceeds from the Tranche B-5 Term Loan were used to refinance the outstanding principal of our Tranche B-2 Term Loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest and applicable fees.\nOn October 9, 2013, we entered into the Third Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended) to reflect a technical change clarifying certain defined terms added pursuant to the Second Amendment.\nOn June 3, 2013, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended). The Second Amendment provided for the refinancing of the then outstanding principal balance of our Tranche B-1 Term Loan and our Euro Term Loan with the proceeds of a new $483.0 million term loan (the Tranche B-3 Term Loan) and a new \u0080350.0 million term loan (the Euro Tranche B Term Loan). Interest on the Tranche B-3 Term Loan is based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to either, at our option, an Adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 2.75% per annum, with an Adjusted LIBOR floor of 1.0%, or an alternate base rate, plus a margin of 1.75% per annum, with a minimum alternative base rate floor of 2.0%. The Tranche B-3 Term Loan matures on June 3, 2020, which is an extension of approximately three and a half years compared to the original Tranche B-1 Term Loan maturity date. Interest on the Euro Tranche B Term Loan is based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to an Adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 3.0% per annum, with an Adjusted LIBOR floor of 1.0%. The Euro Tranche B Term Loan matures on June 3, 2020, which is an extension of approximately 24 months compared to the original Euro Term Loan maturity date. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Tranche B-3 Term Loan and Euro Tranche B Term Loan are guaranteed by the same guarantors, and are secured by liens on substantially all of the borrower's assets and the assets of the guarantors. The Second Amendment also amended the Credit Agreement to, among other things, limit the applicability of the financial maintenance covenant (maximum total leverage ratio) to the Revolver and then only for those fiscal quarters in which we have significant borrowings under our Revolver outstanding as of the last day of such fiscal quarter.\nProceeds from the Tranche B-3 Term Loan and Euro Tranche B Term Loan were used to refinance the outstanding principal balance of our Tranche B-1 Term Loan and our Euro Term Loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest and applicable fees. In addition, $250.0 million of the proceeds were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of our Tranche B-2 Term Loan.\nOn September 27, 2012, we entered into the Refinancing Amendment No. 1 (the First Amendment) to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment provided for the refinancing of the then outstanding principal balance of our Tranche B Term Loan of $2,763.0 million with the proceeds of a new $2,793.1 million term loan (the Tranche B-2 Term Loan). Interest on the Tranche B-2 Term Loan was based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to, at our option, an Adjusted LIBOR rate, plus a margin of 4.0% per annum, with an Adjusted LIBOR floor of 1.25% per annum, or ABR, plus a margin of 3.0% per annum, with an ABR floor of 2.25% per annum. This was a reduction in our effective rate related to this term loan as compared to the Tranche B Term Loan which was based on an Adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin of 5.0% per annum. The Tranche B-2 Term Loan was to mature on April 5, 2018, which was the same as the original Tranche B Term Loan maturity date. Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Tranche B-2 Term Loan was guaranteed by the same guarantors, and was secured by liens on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the guarantors.\nProceeds from the Tranche B-2 Term Loan were used to refinance the outstanding principal of our Tranche B Term Loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest and applicable fees, including a prepayment premium of 1.0% of the principal amount thereof, in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.\nSenior Notes\nInfor 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes\nOn April 1, 2015, we issued approximately $1,030.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes and \u0080350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes at an issue price of 100% (together, the Senior Notes). On April 23, 2015, we issued an additional $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes at an issue price of 102.25% plus accrued interest from April 1, 2015. The 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes mature on May 15, 2022, and bear interest at the applicable rates per annum that is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears, on May 15 and November 15 each year, beginning on November 15, 2015.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes, we entered into a registration rights agreements with the initial purchasers of the notes. Under the registration rights agreements we agreed to file with the SEC a registration statement with respect to an offer to exchange the 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes for a new issue of substantially identical notes no later than 365 days after the date of the original issuance of the notes. The requisite registration statement on Form S-4 was filed with the SEC on January 25, 2016 and was declared effective by the SEC on February 12, 2016. See Senior Notes Exchange Offer, below.\nIndex to Financial Statements Proceeds from the issuance of the 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes were used to repay the outstanding balances of our 9 3/8%, 10.0% and 11.5% Senior Notes, discussed below, including applicable redemption premiums thereon, accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nThe 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of Infor (US), Inc. and are guaranteed by Infor, Inc. and certain of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. Under the indentures governing the senior notes, we are subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants.\nInfor 9 3/8% and 10.0% Senior Notes\nOn April 5, 2012, we issued approximately $1,015.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3/8% Senior Notes and \u0080250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 10.0% Senior Notes.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe have changed our fiscal year end from May 31 to April 30, effective for our fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years. Accordingly, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reported fiscal 2016 as the period of May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2016 and fiscal 2015 as the 11-month transition period from June 1, 2014 through April 30, 2015.\nWithin this Management's Discussion and Analysis, fiscal 2016 is compared to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported. In addition, to facilitate comparisons to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported, we have presented the similar unaudited 11-month period as recast for fiscal 2014 (June 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data presented above, our Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented, as well as our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, fair value of equity-based compensation, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, restructuring obligations and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience and on other information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made. We believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from our estimates.\nAny reference to we, our, us, Infor or the Company refers to Infor, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nManagement Overview\nGeneral\nInfor is a global provider of enterprise business applications software and services focused primarily on medium and large enterprises. We develop, market, distribute and service enterprise software applications that help organizations manage their businesses. We deliver integrated enterprise business solutions including customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise asset management (EAM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), financial management, human capital management (HCM), performance management, product lifecycle management, property management systems, central reservations systems, supplier relationship management and supply chain management (SCM), including business-specific inventory management, transportation logistics, manufacturing and warehouse management software. Infor also offers software license updates and product support as well as other services including consulting, advanced product services, hosting and education.\nIndex to Financial Statements We offer a broad range of software applications and industry-specific solutions that we believe help our customers improve their business processes and reduce costs, resulting in better business or operational performance. Our solutions help automate and integrate critical business processes which enable our customers to better manage their suppliers, partners, customers and employees.\nWe specialize in and target specific industries (or verticals), and have industry-specific business units that leverage our industry-oriented products and teams. We provide industry-specific ERP software products to companies in the manufacturing, distribution, healthcare, public sector, automotive, service industries, equipment services, management and rental (ESM&R), consumer products & retail and hospitality industries. Our industry-specific approach distinguishes us from larger competing ERP vendors, whose primary focus is on less specialized software programs that take more time and cost to tailor to our target customers' specific needs. Augmenting our vertical-specific applications, we have leading horizontal software applications, including our CRM, EAM, HCM, SCM and financial application suites, which, through our proprietary light-weight middleware solution ION, are integrated with our enterprise software applications and sold across verticals.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of perpetual software licenses granting customers use of our software products, providing access to software products through our SaaS subscription offerings, providing product updates and support and providing consulting services to our customers. We operate in three segments: License, Maintenance and Consulting. We market and sell our software and services primarily through a direct sales force, which is augmented by systems integrators and resellers. In addition to providing software products, we generate substantial recurring revenue by providing on-going software support services to our customers through our maintenance and support programs. The product updates and support we provide are valued by our customers as evidenced by our high annual maintenance retention rates. We also help our customers implement and use our applications effectively through our consulting services offerings, including training, implementation and consulting services.\nWe serve customers across three geographic regions-the Americas, EMEA and APAC. We have approximately 14,390 employees worldwide and have offices in 43 countries. We have established a worldwide infrastructure for distribution, development and support of our enterprise software. This worldwide coverage provides us with both economies of scale and the ability to leverage our geographical expertise to effectively enter new markets and segments. In fiscal 2016, our Americas, EMEA and APAC regions generated approximately 62.8%, 29.6% and 7.6% of our revenues, respectively. Though we have a considerable presence outside of the U.S. today, we believe we have significant opportunities to expand internationally and capture market share, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions.\nFiscal 2016 Overview\nFiscal 2016 was another year of investment, innovation and growth for Infor as we continued our pivot to the cloud. We continued to make significant investments in our products to meet the specific needs of customers in targeted microvertical industries, in our user interface to unify and beautify the user experience, and in upgrading our customer base through Infor UpgradeX to Infor CloudSuite. Flexibility, agility, collaboration, mobility and ease of use are our key design principles focused on helping our customers become faster and more efficient.\nWe now have more than 58 million users accessing Infor cloud applications in 100 different countries. We have expanded our Infor CloudSuite portfolio by delivering 12 industry suites: Infor CloudSuite Automotive, Infor CloudSuite Aerospace & Defense, Infor CloudSuite Chemicals, Infor CloudSuite Distribution, Infor CloudSuite Equipment, Infor CloudSuite Fashion, Infor CloudSuite Food & Beverage, Infor CloudSuite Healthcare, Infor CloudSuite High-Tech, Infor CloudSuite Hospitality, Infor CloudSuite Industrial, and Infor CloudSuite Public Sector. We also delivered Infor CloudSuite Corporate and Infor CloudSuite Business, ready-to-run ERP cloud platforms that provide streamlined back-office management and deep visibility into business facets, from financials, reporting, and human resources to supply chain, project, sales, and customer relationship management for large enterprises (Corporate) and SMBs (Business). We also offer CloudSuite products for Financial Management (Infor CloudSuite Financials) and facilities management (Infor CloudSuite Facilities).Infor now has more than 4,700 cloud customers in more than 7,200 customer sites. As a result of our robust CloudSuite offerings, our SaaS revenues continued to experience significant growth in fiscal 2016.\nWe are actively rolling-out our Infor Xi platform across all of our growth products, with many complete this year. Building on our previous release, Infor 10x, Infor Xi delivers a major step in achieving our vision for cloud applications that address specific industry needs with responsive design infused with machine-learning and big data analytics.\nOur fiscal 2016 results were driven by our continued investments in innovative products and applications and the expansion of our CloudSuite offerings. We entered into over 16,570 deals and added approximately 2,500 new customers. Our customer retention rate continues to exceed 93%. Our average deal size continues to grow; we experienced a 37.1% increase in the number of deals valued at greater than $1 million and a 14.3% increase in the average size of deals valued at greater than $1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Total revenues increased by 15.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5.1%, as we realized strong growth in our software license fees and subscription revenue across all regions.\nIndex to Financial Statements Acquisitions\nAn acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. We have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases our overall value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. Operating results relating to these acquisitions have been included in our results of operations as of the applicable acquisition dates.\nWe believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings, or additional equity. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nFiscal 2016 Acquisitions\nOn September 18, 2015, we acquired a majority ownership stake of 81.48% in GT Nexus, for $549.9 million, net of cash acquired (the GT Nexus Acquisition). GT Nexus is a cloud-based SCM vendor based in Oakland, California and provides the cloud platform that some of the world's largest companies, across many sectors, such as manufacturing and retail, use to monitor and orchestrate their global supply chains including automation of sourcing, trade finance and logistics operations, enabling Infor to create a global commerce cloud providing end-to-end visibility and control across physical and financial supply chains. We funded the total consideration related to this transaction through the use of the proceeds of the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes discussed below, together with cash on hand and equity issued to certain shareholders and management of GT Nexus.\nFiscal 2015 Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2015, we completed one acquisition. On September 2, 2014, we acquired the assets of Saleslogix, a division of privately held Swiftpage, Inc., for approximately $30.1 million, net of cash acquired. Based in Scottsdale, Arizona, Saleslogix is a provider of SaaS CRM software accessible via mobile devices, desktops, and laptops. The acquisition of Saleslogix complemented our CRM product offerings and added additional sales and service functionality to our industry-focused Infor CloudSuites in the high-growth CRM market.\nFiscal 2014 Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2014, we completed two acquisitions. On January 7, 2014, we acquired PeopleAnswers, a privately held company based in Dallas, Texas, for approximately $200.0 million. PeopleAnswers is a provider of predictive talent analytics which complemented and further expanded our Infor HCM suite. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed an additional acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $1.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nOver the past few fiscal years, we have undertaken significant financing activities in conjunction with our acquisitions and the recapitalization and refinancing of our debt structure.\nIn fiscal 2016, in connection with the GT Nexus Acquisition, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% first lien senior secured notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), after fees and expenses, of approximately $478.5 million were used to fund the GT Nexus Acquisition, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2015 we issued $1,630.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes and \u0080350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes. The proceeds from the issuance of the 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes were used to repay the balance of all of our outstanding senior notes, including our 9 3/8%, 10.0% and 11.5% Senior Notes, as well as applicable redemption premiums thereon, accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2014 we amended our Credit Agreement to refinance all of our then outstanding term loans under our credit facilities at favorable interest rates and extended the applicable maturity dates.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt, below for details of our financing activities.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2014 affiliates of Infor issued senior notes to finance the repayment of their existing debt and fund distributions to our equity investors. On April 8, 2014, Infor Software Parent, LLC (HoldCo), an indirect holding company for Infor, and its direct subsidiary Infor Software Parent, Inc., issued $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of their 7.125%/7.875% Senior Contingent Cash Pay Notes (the HoldCo Notes). Proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to repay the outstanding balance of HoldCo's affiliate's existing debt of $166.8 million, to make a $565.5 distribution to HoldCo equityholders, to pay a call premium and accrued interest related to their existing debt, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses. We may from time-to-time service interest payments related to the HoldCo Notes. Any payment of interest that we may pay will be funded primarily through dividend distributions from Infor to HoldCo. We have not reflected the HoldCo Notes in our Consolidated Financial Statements for any of the periods presented in accordance with applicable SEC guidance. See Note 12, Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our affiliate company borrowings.\nIndex to Financial Statements Restructuring Activities\nOver the past few years, in response to the challenging and sometimes uncertain domestic and global economic conditions, we have undertaken certain restructuring actions to reduce our headcount and streamline our operations. We have also taken certain actions to better focus our efforts on our targeted industry-specific solutions. In addition, as a result of our active acquisition program, we have taken certain actions related to acquired entities from time-to-time to streamline back-office functions and eliminate redundancies incurred through acquisitions. We also restructured and consolidated office lease arrangements to eliminate redundant locations worldwide.\nOur results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 include restructuring charges of $28.0 million, $5.7 million and $18.6 million, respectively, relating to these actions. We continue to closely monitor our discretionary spending while preserving targeted investments that we believe will facilitate our long-term growth and increase our operational efficiencies. During fiscal 2016, we engaged an outside consulting firm to provide restructuring advisory services focusing on all areas of our operations across all geographies. Specific actions related to these efforts are reflected in the restructuring charges taken in fiscal 2016. We may consider possible future actions to reduce our operating costs if circumstances warrant.\nForeign Currency\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro and British Pound. Our revenues and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. Downward fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to a foreign currency generally have the effect of increasing our revenues but also increasing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Similarly, strengthening in the U.S. Dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In addition, we have certain intercompany transfer pricing transactions, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are not considered permanent in nature. Fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these intercompany balances may impact our results of operations.\nFor fiscal 2016, the average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound strengthened by approximately 9.9% and 5.5%, respectively, as compared to the average exchange rates for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015, the average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound strengthened by approximately 8.9% and 1.2%, respectively, as compared to the average exchange rates for fiscal 2014.\nOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, the most current period results for our entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the average exchange rates in effect in the prior comparable period) rather than the average exchange rates in effect during the respective period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual results in reported currency and in constant currency.\nThe following tables summarize the period-over-period change, both in U.S. Dollars and percentages, in revenues and costs and expenses, isolating the fluctuations in exchange rates from changes in activity and pricing on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 versus the 11-month transition period ended April 30, 2015, and for the 11-month transition period ended April 30, 2015 versus the comparable unaudited 11-month period ended April 30, 2014, as recast:\n\nIndex to Financial Statements\n Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The policies that reflect those areas that require more significant use of estimates, judgments and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements include the following:\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition; \n \u2022 Business Combinations; \n \u2022 Restructuring; \n \u2022 Valuation of Accounts Receivable; \n \u2022 Valuation and Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets; \n \u2022 Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets; \n \u2022 Contingencies-Litigation Reserves; and \n \u2022 Equity-Based Compensation.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management and investors to evaluate our performance. Revenue recognition for software businesses is very complex. We follow specific guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded. However, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to year. The significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable. In addition, our transactions often consist of multiple-element arrangements, which typically include software license fees, maintenance and support fees and consulting service fees. The amounts of revenue reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations may vary, due to the amount of judgment required to address significant assumptions, risks and uncertainties in applying the guidelines under GAAP.\nWe generate revenues primarily by licensing software and SaaS subscriptions, providing software support and product updates, and providing consulting services to our customers. We record software license, product updates and support, and related service revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, and we record revenues related to non-software deliverables such as SaaS subscriptions and related service revenue in accordance with guidance provided by ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded net of applicable taxes. Our specific revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nIndex to Financial Statements Software license fees and subscriptions\nSoftware license fees and subscriptions revenues are primarily from sales of perpetual software licenses granting customers use of our software products and access to software products through our SaaS subscription offerings. Software license fees are recognized when the following criteria are met: 1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, 2) the software product has been delivered, 3) the fees are fixed or determinable and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. SaaS subscription revenues are recognized over the contract term once the software is made available for use in an environment hosted, supported, and maintained by Infor.\nWe do not generally offer rights of return or acceptance clauses. If a software license contains rights of return or customer acceptance criteria, recognition of the software license fee revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation of the right of return.\nWe record revenues from sales of third-party products on a \u201cgross\u201d basis pursuant to ASC 605-45 Revenue Recognition, Principal Agent Considerations, when we are the primary obligor in the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWe have changed our fiscal year end from May 31 to April 30, effective for our fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years. Accordingly, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have reported fiscal 2016 as the period of May 1, 2015 through April 30, 2016 and fiscal 2015 as the 11-month transition period from June 1, 2014 through April 30, 2015.\nWithin this Management's Discussion and Analysis, fiscal 2016 is compared to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported. In addition, to facilitate comparisons to our fiscal 2015 11-month transition period as originally reported, we have presented the similar unaudited 11-month period as recast for fiscal 2014 (June 1, 2013 through April 30, 2014).\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data presented above, our Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented, as well as our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns, fair value of equity-based compensation, fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, restructuring obligations and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates and assumptions on our historical experience and on other information available to us at the time that these estimates and assumptions are made. We believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from our estimates.\nAny reference to we, our, us, Infor or the Company refers to Infor, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nManagement Overview\nGeneral\nInfor is a global provider of enterprise business applications software and services focused primarily on medium and large enterprises. We develop, market, distribute and service enterprise software applications that help organizations manage their businesses. We deliver integrated enterprise business solutions including customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise asset management (EAM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), financial management, human capital management (HCM), performance management, product lifecycle management, property management systems, central reservations systems, supplier relationship management and supply chain management (SCM), including business-specific inventory management, transportation logistics, manufacturing and warehouse management software. Infor also offers software license updates and product support as well as other services including consulting, advanced product services, hosting and education.\nIndex to Financial Statements We offer a broad range of software applications and industry-specific solutions that we believe help our customers improve their business processes and reduce costs, resulting in better business or operational performance. Our solutions help automate and integrate critical business processes which enable our customers to better manage their suppliers, partners, customers and employees.\nWe specialize in and target specific industries (or verticals), and have industry-specific business units that leverage our industry-oriented products and teams. We provide industry-specific ERP software products to companies in the manufacturing, distribution, healthcare, public sector, automotive, service industries, equipment services, management and rental (ESM&R), consumer products & retail and hospitality industries. Our industry-specific approach distinguishes us from larger competing ERP vendors, whose primary focus is on less specialized software programs that take more time and cost to tailor to our target customers' specific needs. Augmenting our vertical-specific applications, we have leading horizontal software applications, including our CRM, EAM, HCM, SCM and financial application suites, which, through our proprietary light-weight middleware solution ION, are integrated with our enterprise software applications and sold across verticals.\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of perpetual software licenses granting customers use of our software products, providing access to software products through our SaaS subscription offerings, providing product updates and support and providing consulting services to our customers. We operate in three segments: License, Maintenance and Consulting. We market and sell our software and services primarily through a direct sales force, which is augmented by systems integrators and resellers. In addition to providing software products, we generate substantial recurring revenue by providing on-going software support services to our customers through our maintenance and support programs. The product updates and support we provide are valued by our customers as evidenced by our high annual maintenance retention rates. We also help our customers implement and use our applications effectively through our consulting services offerings, including training, implementation and consulting services.\nWe serve customers across three geographic regions-the Americas, EMEA and APAC. We have approximately 14,390 employees worldwide and have offices in 43 countries. We have established a worldwide infrastructure for distribution, development and support of our enterprise software. This worldwide coverage provides us with both economies of scale and the ability to leverage our geographical expertise to effectively enter new markets and segments. In fiscal 2016, our Americas, EMEA and APAC regions generated approximately 62.8%, 29.6% and 7.6% of our revenues, respectively. Though we have a considerable presence outside of the U.S. today, we believe we have significant opportunities to expand internationally and capture market share, especially in the EMEA and APAC regions.\nFiscal 2016 Overview\nFiscal 2016 was another year of investment, innovation and growth for Infor as we continued our pivot to the cloud. We continued to make significant investments in our products to meet the specific needs of customers in targeted microvertical industries, in our user interface to unify and beautify the user experience, and in upgrading our customer base through Infor UpgradeX to Infor CloudSuite. Flexibility, agility, collaboration, mobility and ease of use are our key design principles focused on helping our customers become faster and more efficient.\nWe now have more than 58 million users accessing Infor cloud applications in 100 different countries. We have expanded our Infor CloudSuite portfolio by delivering 12 industry suites: Infor CloudSuite Automotive, Infor CloudSuite Aerospace & Defense, Infor CloudSuite Chemicals, Infor CloudSuite Distribution, Infor CloudSuite Equipment, Infor CloudSuite Fashion, Infor CloudSuite Food & Beverage, Infor CloudSuite Healthcare, Infor CloudSuite High-Tech, Infor CloudSuite Hospitality, Infor CloudSuite Industrial, and Infor CloudSuite Public Sector. We also delivered Infor CloudSuite Corporate and Infor CloudSuite Business, ready-to-run ERP cloud platforms that provide streamlined back-office management and deep visibility into business facets, from financials, reporting, and human resources to supply chain, project, sales, and customer relationship management for large enterprises (Corporate) and SMBs (Business). We also offer CloudSuite products for Financial Management (Infor CloudSuite Financials) and facilities management (Infor CloudSuite Facilities).Infor now has more than 4,700 cloud customers in more than 7,200 customer sites. As a result of our robust CloudSuite offerings, our SaaS revenues continued to experience significant growth in fiscal 2016.\nWe are actively rolling-out our Infor Xi platform across all of our growth products, with many complete this year. Building on our previous release, Infor 10x, Infor Xi delivers a major step in achieving our vision for cloud applications that address specific industry needs with responsive design infused with machine-learning and big data analytics.\nOur fiscal 2016 results were driven by our continued investments in innovative products and applications and the expansion of our CloudSuite offerings. We entered into over 16,570 deals and added approximately 2,500 new customers. Our customer retention rate continues to exceed 93%. Our average deal size continues to grow; we experienced a 37.1% increase in the number of deals valued at greater than $1 million and a 14.3% increase in the average size of deals valued at greater than $1 million in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Total revenues increased by 15.5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact of 5.1%, as we realized strong growth in our software license fees and subscription revenue across all regions.\nIndex to Financial Statements Acquisitions\nAn acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy. We have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. We believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position, enhances the products and services that we can offer to customers, expands our customer base, provides greater scale to accelerate innovation, grows our revenues and earnings, and increases our overall value. We expect to continue to acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy. See Note 3, Acquisitions, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our recent acquisitions. Operating results relating to these acquisitions have been included in our results of operations as of the applicable acquisition dates.\nWe believe we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings, or additional equity. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.\nFiscal 2016 Acquisitions\nOn September 18, 2015, we acquired a majority ownership stake of 81.48% in GT Nexus, for $549.9 million, net of cash acquired (the GT Nexus Acquisition). GT Nexus is a cloud-based SCM vendor based in Oakland, California and provides the cloud platform that some of the world's largest companies, across many sectors, such as manufacturing and retail, use to monitor and orchestrate their global supply chains including automation of sourcing, trade finance and logistics operations, enabling Infor to create a global commerce cloud providing end-to-end visibility and control across physical and financial supply chains. We funded the total consideration related to this transaction through the use of the proceeds of the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes discussed below, together with cash on hand and equity issued to certain shareholders and management of GT Nexus.\nFiscal 2015 Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2015, we completed one acquisition. On September 2, 2014, we acquired the assets of Saleslogix, a division of privately held Swiftpage, Inc., for approximately $30.1 million, net of cash acquired. Based in Scottsdale, Arizona, Saleslogix is a provider of SaaS CRM software accessible via mobile devices, desktops, and laptops. The acquisition of Saleslogix complemented our CRM product offerings and added additional sales and service functionality to our industry-focused Infor CloudSuites in the high-growth CRM market.\nFiscal 2014 Acquisitions\nIn fiscal 2014, we completed two acquisitions. On January 7, 2014, we acquired PeopleAnswers, a privately held company based in Dallas, Texas, for approximately $200.0 million. PeopleAnswers is a provider of predictive talent analytics which complemented and further expanded our Infor HCM suite. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we completed an additional acquisition for a purchase price of approximately $1.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nOver the past few fiscal years, we have undertaken significant financing activities in conjunction with our acquisitions and the recapitalization and refinancing of our debt structure.\nIn fiscal 2016, in connection with the GT Nexus Acquisition, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% first lien senior secured notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of our Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), after fees and expenses, of approximately $478.5 million were used to fund the GT Nexus Acquisition, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2015 we issued $1,630.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.5% Senior Notes and \u0080350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.75% Senior Notes. The proceeds from the issuance of the 6.5% and 5.75% Senior Notes were used to repay the balance of all of our outstanding senior notes, including our 9 3/8%, 10.0% and 11.5% Senior Notes, as well as applicable redemption premiums thereon, accrued and unpaid interest, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2014 we amended our Credit Agreement to refinance all of our then outstanding term loans under our credit facilities at favorable interest rates and extended the applicable maturity dates.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Debt, below for details of our financing activities.\nIn addition, in fiscal 2014 affiliates of Infor issued senior notes to finance the repayment of their existing debt and fund distributions to our equity investors. On April 8, 2014, Infor Software Parent, LLC (HoldCo), an indirect holding company for Infor, and its direct subsidiary Infor Software Parent, Inc., issued $750.0 million in aggregate principal amount of their 7.125%/7.875% Senior Contingent Cash Pay Notes (the HoldCo Notes). Proceeds from the sale of these notes were used to repay the outstanding balance of HoldCo's affiliate's existing debt of $166.8 million, to make a $565.5 distribution to HoldCo equityholders, to pay a call premium and accrued interest related to their existing debt, and to pay related transaction fees and expenses. We may from time-to-time service interest payments related to the HoldCo Notes. Any payment of interest that we may pay will be funded primarily through dividend distributions from Infor to HoldCo. We have not reflected the HoldCo Notes in our Consolidated Financial Statements for any of the periods presented in accordance with applicable SEC guidance. See Note 12, Debt, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our affiliate company borrowings.\nIndex to Financial Statements Restructuring Activities\nOver the past few years, in response to the challenging and sometimes uncertain domestic and global economic conditions, we have undertaken certain restructuring actions to reduce our headcount and streamline our operations. We have also taken certain actions to better focus our efforts on our targeted industry-specific solutions. In addition, as a result of our active acquisition program, we have taken certain actions related to acquired entities from time-to-time to streamline back-office functions and eliminate redundancies incurred through acquisitions. We also restructured and consolidated office lease arrangements to eliminate redundant locations worldwide.\nOur results for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 include restructuring charges of $28.0 million, $5.7 million and $18.6 million, respectively, relating to these actions. We continue to closely monitor our discretionary spending while preserving targeted investments that we believe will facilitate our long-term growth and increase our operational efficiencies. During fiscal 2016, we engaged an outside consulting firm to provide restructuring advisory services focusing on all areas of our operations across all geographies. Specific actions related to these efforts are reflected in the restructuring charges taken in fiscal 2016. We may consider possible future actions to reduce our operating costs if circumstances warrant.\nForeign Currency\nA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, particularly the Euro and British Pound. Our revenues and operating expenses are affected by fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates. Downward fluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar compared to a foreign currency generally have the effect of increasing our revenues but also increasing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Similarly, strengthening in the U.S. Dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. In addition, we have certain intercompany transfer pricing transactions, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are not considered permanent in nature. Fluctuations in applicable foreign currency exchange rates on these intercompany balances may impact our results of operations.\nFor fiscal 2016, the average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound strengthened by approximately 9.9% and 5.5%, respectively, as compared to the average exchange rates for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015, the average exchange rates for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and British Pound strengthened by approximately 8.9% and 1.2%, respectively, as compared to the average exchange rates for fiscal 2014.\nOur international operations have provided and will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. As a result, total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period using constant currency disclosure. To present this information, the most current period results for our entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e. the average exchange rates in effect in the prior comparable period) rather than the average exchange rates in effect during the respective period. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual results in reported currency and in constant currency.\nThe following tables summarize the period-over-period change, both in U.S. Dollars and percentages, in revenues and costs and expenses, isolating the fluctuations in exchange rates from changes in activity and pricing on a constant currency basis for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 versus the 11-month transition period ended April 30, 2015, and for the 11-month transition period ended April 30, 2015 versus the comparable unaudited 11-month period ended April 30, 2014, as recast:\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The policies that reflect those areas that require more significant use of estimates, judgments and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements include the following:\n \u2022 Revenue Recognition; \n \u2022 Business Combinations; \n \u2022 Restructuring; \n \u2022 Valuation of Accounts Receivable; \n \u2022 Valuation and Assessment of Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets; \n \u2022 Income Taxes and Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets; \n \u2022 Contingencies-Litigation Reserves; and \n \u2022 Equity-Based Compensation.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result. Our senior management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is a key component of our results of operations and is a key metric used by management and investors to evaluate our performance. Revenue recognition for software businesses is very complex. We follow specific guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded. However, certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy. Revenue results are difficult to predict, and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from year to year. The significant judgments for revenue recognition typically involve whether collectability can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable. In addition, our transactions often consist of multiple-element arrangements, which typically include software license fees, maintenance and support fees and consulting service fees. The amounts of revenue reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations may vary, due to the amount of judgment required to address significant assumptions, risks and uncertainties in applying the guidelines under GAAP.\nWe generate revenues primarily by licensing software and SaaS subscriptions, providing software support and product updates, and providing consulting services to our customers. We record software license, product updates and support, and related service revenues in accordance with the guidance provided by ASC 985-605, Software-Revenue Recognition, and we record revenues related to non-software deliverables such as SaaS subscriptions and related service revenue in accordance with guidance provided by ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recorded net of applicable taxes. Our specific revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nIndex to Financial Statements Software license fees and subscriptions\nSoftware license fees and subscriptions revenues are primarily from sales of perpetual software licenses granting customers use of our software products and access to software products through our SaaS subscription offerings. Software license fees are recognized when the following criteria are met: 1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, 2) the software product has been delivered, 3) the fees are fixed or determinable and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. SaaS subscription revenues are recognized over the contract term once the software is made available for use in an environment hosted, supported, and maintained by Infor.\nWe do not generally offer rights of return or acceptance clauses. If a software license contains rights of return or customer acceptance criteria, recognition of the software license fee revenue is deferred until the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation of the right of return.\nWe record revenues from sales of third-party products on a \u201cgross\u201d basis pursuant to ASC 605-45 Revenue Recognition, Principal Agent Considerations, when we are the primary obligor in the"}
