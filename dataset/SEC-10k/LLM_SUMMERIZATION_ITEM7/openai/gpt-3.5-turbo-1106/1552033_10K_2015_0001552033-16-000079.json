MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of TransUnion's financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information,\u201d including TransUnion's audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to TransUnion and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including TransUnion Intermediate.\nOverview\nTransUnion is a leading global risk and information solutions provider to businesses and consumers. We provide consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. We are differentiated by our comprehensive and unique datasets, our next-generation technology and our analytics and decisioning capabilities, which enable us to deliver insights across the entire consumer lifecycle. We believe we are the largest provider of risk and information solutions in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, sometimes referred to as verticals, including financial services, insurance and healthcare. We have a global presence in over 30 countries across North America, Africa, Latin America and Asia.\nWe obtain financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from an average of 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our deep analytics expertise, which includes our people as well as tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enables businesses and consumers to gain better insights into their risk and financial data. Our decisioning capabilities, which are generally delivered on a software-as-a-service platform, allows businesses to interpret data and apply their specific qualifying criteria to make decisions and take action with respect to their customers. Collectively, our data, analytics and decisioning capabilities allow businesses to authenticate the identity of consumers, effectively determine the most relevant products for consumers, retain and cross-sell to existing consumers, identify and acquire new consumers and reduce loss from fraud. Similarly, our capabilities allow consumers to see how their credit profiles have changed over time, understand the impact of financial decisions on their credit scores and manage their personal information as well as to take precautions against identity theft.\nSegments\nWe manage our business and report our financial results in three operating segments: USIS, International and Consumer Interactive.\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>USIS provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical and decisioning services to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. The core capabilities and delivery platforms in our USIS segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers and business issues. We offer our services to customers in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The International segment provides services similar to our USIS segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and decisioning services and other value-added risk management services. In addition, we have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, insurance, automotive, collections and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment that help consumers proactively manage their personal finances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft.

Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels.\nIn addition, Corporate provides shared services for the Company and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the operating segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically for enterprise-level functions and are primarily administrative in nature.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nThe following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, our results of operations:\nMacroeconomic and Industry Trends\nOur revenues are significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including the availability of affordable credit and capital, interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. Since the beginning of 2014, we have seen continuing signs of improved economic conditions and increased market stabilization. In the United States, we also saw improvement in the consumer lending market, including mortgage refinancings resulting from low long-term mortgage rates, an improving housing market, increased auto loans, a decrease in unemployment, an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in demand for our marketing services. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we continue to see increased demand for our credit and identity theft solutions. These factors helped drive improved financial results in all of our segments in 2015 and 2014. The economic and market improvements were tempered by continuing concern about economic conditions that has limited consumer spending and has put pressure on growth in our businesses. Also, during the first quarter of 2014, North America had several weeks of extreme cold-weather conditions which negatively impacted revenue for that period. In addition, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar has diminished the operating results reported by our International operations during 2015 and 2014.\nOur revenues are also significantly influenced by industry trends, including the demand for information services in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries we serve. Companies are increasingly relying on business analytics and big-data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. As customers have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data generated by their own activities, they are increasingly expecting access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked customers. Demand for consumer solutions is rising with higher consumer awareness of the importance and usage of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and more readily available free credit information. The increasing number and complexity of regulations, including new capital requirements and the Dodd-Frank Act, make operations for businesses more challenging.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRecent Developments\nIn June 2015, in anticipation of our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), our board of directors authorized and we effected a 1.333 to 1 stock split of our common stock. All periods presented in this report reflect the split.\nIn June 2015, we entered into amendments to refinance the senior secured credit facility with a new $1,881.0 million term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan B\"). Among other things, the amendments lowered the interest rate floor and modified the step-down interest rate margin based on achieving certain total leverage ratios and senior secured net leverage ratios. The amendments also included a new $350.0 million five-year senior secured term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan A\") and refinanced the existing revolving line of credit and replaced it with a five-year $210.0 million revolving line of credit.\nOn June 30, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 33,977,273 shares, including 4,431,818 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $714.7 million. On July 15, 2015, we used the net proceeds, along with the $350.0 million borrowings from the Senior Secured Term Loan A, to redeem all of the outstanding 9.625% and 8.125% Senior Notes. Collectively the refinance and redemptions resulted in $37.6 million of expense recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income in 2015, including a prepayment premium, accrued interest, the write-off of unamortized deferred debt fees and discounts, and certain transaction costs.\nOn December 18, 2015, we entered into interest rate cap agreements that will effectively cap our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our existing senior secured term loans at 0.75% beginning June 30, 2016. We have designated these cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The initial aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,526.4 million and is scheduled to decrease each quarter beginning September 30, 2016, until the agreement terminates on June 30, 2020. Beginning July 2016, we will pay the various counter-parties a fixed rate of interest on the outstanding notional amounts of between 0.98% and 0.994% and receive payments to the extent LIBOR exceeds 0.75%. We will record the net payments paid or received as interest expense. The change in fair value of the caps is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to the extent the caps are effective, and in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income to the extent the caps are ineffective.\nRecent Acquisitions and Partnerships\nWe selectively evaluate acquisitions and partnerships as a means to expand our business and international footprint and to enter new markets. During the past three years we completed the following acquisitions:\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On December 9, 2015, we acquired 100% of the voting share capital in Trustev Limited (\"Trustev\").

Online Data Services encompass services delivered in real-time using both credit and public record datasets. We also provide online reports that link public record datasets for qualified businesses seeking to locate consumers, specific assets or investigate relationships among consumers, businesses and locations. Collectively, the reports, characteristics and scores, with variations tailored for specific industries, form the basis of Online Data Services. We also provide online services to help businesses manage fraud and authenticate a consumer's identity when they initiate a new business relationship. Additionally, we provide data to businesses to help them satisfy know your customer\u201d compliance requirements and to confirm an individual's identity. Marketing Services help our customers develop marketing lists of prospects via direct mail, web and mobile. Our databases are used by our customers to contact individuals to extend firm offers of credit or insurance. We provide portfolio review services, which are periodic reviews of our customers' existing accounts, to help our customers develop cross-selling offers to their existing customers and monitor and manage risk in their existing consumer portfolios. We also provide trigger services which are daily notifications of changes to a consumer profile. Decision Services, our software-as-a-service offerings, includes a number of platforms that help businesses interpret data and predictive model results and apply their customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time automated decisions at the time of customer interaction. Our customers use Decision Services to evaluate business risks and opportunities, including those associated with new consumer credit and checking accounts, insurance applications, account collection, patient registrations and apartment rental requests.\nWe report our International segment revenue in two categories: developed markets and emerging markets. Our developed markets are Canada and Hong Kong. Our emerging markets include Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India. In 2014, we reclassified Puerto Rico to emerging markets to align it with the rest of the Latin America region. Prior years' revenue has been reclassified accordingly.\nConsumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution and financial management. Our products are provided through user friendly online and mobile interfaces and supported by educational content and customer support.\nCost of Services\nCosts of services include data acquisition and royalty fees, costs related to our databases and software applications, consumer and call center support costs, hardware and software maintenance costs, telecommunication expenses and occupancy costs associated with the facilities where these functions are performed.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel-related costs for sales, administrative and management employees, costs for professional and consulting services, advertising and occupancy and facilities expense of these functions.\nNon-Operating Income and Expense\nNon-operating income and expense includes interest expense, interest income, earnings from equity-method investments, dividends from cost-method investments, expenses related to successful and unsuccessful business acquisitions, loan fees, debt refinancing expenses, certain acquisition-related gains and losses and other non-operating income and expenses.\nResults of Operations-Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nKey Performance Measures\nManagement, including our chief operating decision maker, evaluates the financial performance of our businesses based on a variety of key indicators. These indicators include the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measures revenue, cash provided by operating activities and cash paid for capital expenditures. In order to more closely align the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to the definition we use as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as well as a compensation measure under our incentive plan, we have included additional adjustments to our previously defined Adjusted EBITDA. Such additional adjustments consist of expenses for mergers and acquisitions integration, business optimization, our technology transformation project, operating expense tax matters, consulting study fees related to our strategic initiatives and other expenses. All periods have been presented in the table below under our new definition of Adjusted EBITDA. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, these key indicators were as follows:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization and other adjustments noted in the table above. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. In addition, our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure under our incentive compensation plan. Furthermore, under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other income and expense. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income attributable to the Company. The table above provides a reconciliation from our net income (loss) attributable to the Company to Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.\n</td> <td>Consisted of stock-based compensation and cash-settled stock-based compensation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.\n</td> <td>For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following adjustments to operating income: a $(0.1) million reduction in contingent consideration expense from previous acquisitions, $2.1 million of business optimization expenses, and a $0.3 million loss on divestiture of a business operation.

For 2014, USIS revenue increased $78.9 million compared with 2013, with increases in all of the platforms due to improved market conditions and a 7.6% increase in revenue from our acquisitions of eScan and TLO in 2013 and L2C and DHI in 2014.\nOnline Data Services. For 2015, online data services revenue increased $73.6 million due primarily to an 8.7% increase in online credit report unit volume. Also, a change in the mix of products sold resulted in an increase in average pricing for online credit reports. For 2014, online data services revenue increased $40.6 million compared with 2013, due primarily to revenue from our acquisition of TLO and a 3.2% increase in online credit report unit volume primarily in the first six months of 2014, due to higher mortgage interest rates and the resulting decline in refinancings. A change in the mix of products sold resulted in a slight decrease in average pricing for online credit reports in 2014.\nMarketing Services. For 2015, marketing services revenue increased $15.8 million compared with 2014, due primarily to an organic increase in custom data sets and archive information driven by an increase in demand for our new solutions and revenue from our recent acquisitions. For 2014, marketing services revenue increased $8.5 million compared with 2013, due to a decrease in demand for custom datasets and archive information primarily in the insurance and financial services markets.\nDecision Services. For 2015, decision services revenue increased $34.7 million compared with 2014, due primarily to increases in the healthcare and insurance markets and revenue from our acquisition of DHI. For 2014, decision services revenue increased $29.8 million compared with 2013, due primarily to revenue from our acquisition of eScan.\nInternational Segment\nFor 2015, International revenue increased $11.9 million, or 4.6%, compared with 2014. Higher local currency revenue from increased volumes in all regions and the inclusion of revenue from our acquisition of CIBIL was partially offset by a 14.1% decrease in revenue from the impact of weakening foreign currencies. Incremental revenue from our consolidation of CIBIL accounted for a 3.7% increase in revenue in 2015. For 2014, International revenue increased $16.7 million, or 6.9%, compared with 2013. The increase was due to higher local currency revenue from increased volumes in all regions and revenue from our acquisitions of CIBIL and ZipCode, partially offset by a 6.9% decrease in revenue from the impact of weakening foreign currencies. Incremental revenue from our acquisition of CIBIL and ZipCode accounted for an 8.2% increase in International revenue in 2014.\nDeveloped Markets. For 2015, developed markets revenue increased $2.6 million, or 2.9%, compared with 2014, due to higher local currency revenue in both regions partially offset by a 10.6% decrease in revenue from the impact of a weakening Canadian dollar. For 2014, developed markets revenue increased $3.4 million, or 3.7%, due to higher volumes in both regions, partially offset by a decrease of 4.7% primarily from the impact of the weakening Canadian dollar.\nEmerging Markets. For 2015, emerging markets revenue increased $9.3 million, or 5.6%, compared with 2014. Higher local currency revenue in all regions and incremental revenue from our consolidation of CIBIL was partially offset by a 16.0% decrease in revenue from the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the South African rand and Brazilian real. For 2014, emerging markets revenue increased $13.3 million, or 8.8% compared with 2013, due to higher volumes in all regions and the inclusion of revenue from our CIBIL and ZipCode acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease of 8.1% from the impact of weakening foreign currencies, primarily the South African rand. Incremental revenue from our acquisitions of CIBIL and ZipCode accounted for an increase in revenue of 12.8%.\nConsumer Interactive Segment\nFor 2015 and 2014, Consumer Interactive revenue increased $70.4 million and $26.9 million, respectively, compared with each prior period. These increases were due primarily to an increase in revenue in our indirect channel, and an increase in revenue in our direct channel driven by an increase in the average number of direct subscribers.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the periods reported were as follows: Table 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>500.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>473.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>499.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>434.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>353.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>278.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,309.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,176.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,014.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>162.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Services\nFor 2015, cost of services increased $31.4 million compared with 2014.

See Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\" Note 10, \"Debt,\" for additional information about our interest expense.\nEarnings from equity method investments decreased $3.7 million and $1.2 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, due to lower earnings in both years from our Mexico affiliate and due to the consolidation of CIBIL beginning May 21, 2014. Prior to May 21, 2014, earnings from CIBIL were previously recorded under the equity method of accounting.\nFor 2015, loan fees included $33.8 million of fees due to the early redemption of our 9.625% and 8.125% Senior Notes and $3.8 million from the refinance of our senior secured credit facility in June of 2015. For 2014, loan fees included $12.7 million of refinancing fees and other net costs expensed as a result of refinancing our senior secured credit facility.\nAcquisition fees represent costs we have incurred for various acquisition-related efforts. For 2015, acquisition fees included costs related to our acquisition of Trustev and costs of other acquisition efforts. For 2014, acquisition fees included costs related to our acquisitions of DHI, L2C and CIBIL and costs of other acquisition efforts.\nFor 2015, other income (expense), net included a currency remeasurement loss of $3.6 million, a loss of $0.8 million on the swap that no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and other income and expenses. For 2014, other income (expense), net included a net gain of $45.8 million resulting from the early redemption of the 11.375% Senior Notes consisting of the unamortized 2012 Change in Control Transaction fair value increase in the notes of $89.4 million less an early redemption premium and other costs totaling $43.6 million, a $22.2 million gain resulting from remeasuring our previously held equity interests in CIBIL and L2C under the accounting guidance for acquisitions achieved in stages, an impairment charge of $4.1 million related to a cost-method investment that has sold its assets and liquidated, and a loss of $0.6 million on the swap that no longer qualifies for hedge accounting and other income and expenses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor 2015, we reported income before income taxes and a 42.4% effective tax rate, which is higher than the 35.0% U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to tax on our foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested outside the United States, partially offset by a favorable foreign tax rate differential and a credit to deferred state tax expense for changes in state tax rates.\nFor 2014 and 2013, we reported a loss before income taxes with income tax expense, resulting in a negative effective tax rate for both periods. This rate was lower than the 35.0% U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to tax on our foreign earnings that are not considered permanently reinvested outside the United States.\nSubpart F of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code requires U.S. corporate shareholders to recognize current U.S. taxable income from passive income, including earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, regardless of whether that income is remitted to the United States. The look-through rule of Subpart F grants an exception for any passive income of certain foreign subsidiaries that is attributable to an active business. When the look-through exception is not in effect, we are required to accrue a tax liability for those foreign earnings as if those earnings were distributed to the United States. On January 2, 2013 the look-through rule exception for 2012 was retroactively reinstated to January 1, 2012. As a result, we recorded an adjustment in 2013 to account for the reinstatement of the look-through rule retroactive to the prior year. For 2015 and 2014, the look-through rule exception was in effect.\nNo provision has been made for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $118.4 million of unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries that we assert are permanently reinvested in operations outside the United States. Remitting these earnings to the United States would result in additional tax expense that could be as high as approximately $42 million, assuming we cannot use any of the related foreign tax credits. As of December 31, 2015, we have made a provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes of $43.2 million on $123.5 million of unremitted earnings from certain other foreign subsidiaries, as those earnings are not permanently reinvested outside the United States and are not needed to fund our current or expected domestic operations.\nSignificant Changes in Assets and Liabilities\nAdditional paid-in capital increased by $712.7 million at December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014, due to our initial public offering. Long-term debt decreased $701.3 million at December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014, because we used the proceeds of our initial public offering to pay down long-term debt. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 10, Debt\u201d and Note 11, \"Stockholders' Equity,\" for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our senior secured revolving line of credit. Our principal uses of liquidity are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other general corporate purposes. We believe our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and funds available under the senior secured revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, debt service obligations and operating needs for the foreseeable future. We may, however, elect to raise funds through debt or equity financing in the future to fund significant investments or acquisitions that are consistent with our growth strategy.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $133.2 million and $77.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of which $79.7 and $50.6 million was held outside the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under the senior secured revolving line of credit and could have borrowed up to the $210.0 million available. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is consistent with our short-term cash needs and investment objectives. The Company is required to make additional principal payments on the Senior Secured Term Loan B based on excess cash flows of the prior year, as defined in the agreement. There were no excess cash flows for 2015 and therefore no additional payment will be required in 2016. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 10, Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2015, no provision has been made for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $118.4 million of unremitted earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that we assert are permanently reinvested in operations outside the United States. Remitting these earnings to the United States would result in additional tax expense that could be as high as approximately $42 million, assuming we cannot use any of the related foreign tax credits. As of December 31, 2015, we have made a provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes of $43.2 million on $123.5 million of unremitted earnings from our Canadian, South African, Netherlands and Indian subsidiaries, as those earnings are not permanently reinvested outside the United States.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nTable 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Twelve months ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 vs. 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014 vs. 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(197.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(276.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(367.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(51.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>187.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(143.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(5.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(33.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor 2015, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the increase in revenue and decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the increase in cash operating expenses. For 2014, the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to the increase in revenue and decrease in interest expense, partially offset by the increase in cash operating expenses and working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nFor 2015, the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures. For 2014, the decrease in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nFor 2015, the increase in cash used for financing activities was due primarily to the net pay down of our debt, partially offset by the net proceeds from the IPO. For 2014, the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the 2014 refinancing transaction prepayment premium and fees and a decrease in net borrowings.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe make capital expenditures to grow our business by developing new and enhanced capabilities, to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization and to reduce risks. We make capital expenditures for product development, disaster recovery, security enhancements, regulatory compliance, and the replacement and upgrade of existing equipment at the end of its useful life. During the third quarter of 2013, we began a strategic initiative to transform our technology infrastructure to enable growth,\npromote innovation and provide a competitive advantage. We also completed significant improvements to our corporate headquarters facility early in 2015.\nWe expect total capital expenditures to be lower in 2016 than in 2015 as a percentage of revenue as we completed the improvements to our corporate headquarters facility in the first half of 2015 and expect to complete the transformation of our technology platform in the first half of 2016. For 2015, cash paid for capital expenditures decreased $23.0 million, due primarily to a decrease in spending to upgrade our corporate headquarters facility and transform our technology infrastructure. For 2014, cash paid for capital expenditures increased $73.5 million due primarily to the ongoing strategic initiatives to transform our technology infrastructure and corporate headquarters facility. On an accrual basis, our capital expenditures were $163.0 million in 2014 compared with $96.3 million in 2013.\nDebt\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn June 15, 2010, our subsidiary, Trans Union LLC, entered into a senior secured credit facility with various lenders. The senior secured credit facility consists of a senior secured term loan and a senior secured revolving line of credit. In June 2015, we entered into amendments to refinance the senior secured credit facility with a new $1,881.0 million term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan B\") and a new $350.0 million five-year senior secured term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan A\") that was drawn in July 2015. Among other things, the amendments lowered the interest rate floor and modified the step-down interest rate margin based on achieving certain total leverage ratios and senior secured net leverage ratios. The amendments also refinanced the existing revolving line of credit with a five-year $210.0 million revolving line of credit. The capacity under the senior secured credit facility may be increased by an additional $450.0 million so long as certain financial conditions are met, subject, in each case, to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions or institutional lenders.\nOn July 15, 2015, we used the net proceeds from our IPO, along with the $350.0 million borrowings from the Senior Secured Term Loan A, to redeem all of the outstanding 9.625% and 8.125% Senior Notes. Collectively, the refinance and redemptions resulted in $37.6 million of expense recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income in 2015, including a prepayment premium, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees and discounts, and certain transaction costs.\nInterest rates on the refinanced Senior Secured Term Loan B are based on the LIBOR unless otherwise elected, and subject to a floor of 0.75%, plus a margin of 2.75% or 3.00%, depending on our senior secured net leverage ratio. The Company is required to make principal payments of 0.25% of the 2014 refinanced principal balance at the end of each quarter, with the remaining balance due April 9, 2021. The Company is also required to make additional payments based on excess cash flows, as defined in the agreement, of the prior year. Depending on the senior secured net leverage ratio for the year, a principal payment of between zero and fifty percent of the excess cash flows will be due the following year. There were no excess cash flows for 2015 and therefore no payment will be required in 2016.\nInterest rates on Senior Secured Term Loan A are based on LIBOR unless otherwise elected, plus a margin of 2.00% or 2.25%, depending on our total net leverage ratio. The Company is required to make principal payments of 1.25% of the original principal balance at the end of each quarter for the first two years increasing to 1.875% each quarter for the last three years, with the remaining balance due June 30, 2020.\nInterest rates on the refinanced senior secured revolving line of credit are based on LIBOR unless otherwise elected, and is currently LIBOR, plus a margin of 2.00% or 2.25%, depending on our total net leverage ratio. There is a 0.30% or 0.375% annual commitment fee, depending on our total net leverage ratio, payable quarterly based on the undrawn portion of the senior secured revolving line of credit. The commitment under the senior secured revolving line of credit expires on June 30, 2020.\nDuring 2015, the Company repaid borrowings on its senior secured revolving line of credit of $85.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding borrowings under our senior secured revolving line of credit.\nOn December 18, 2015, we terminated our interest rate swap contracts that we entered into on April 30, 2012, and paid the outstanding liability balance of $2.7 million. Changes in the fair value of the swaps prior to termination resulted in a loss of $0.8 recorded in other income and expense in 2015.\nOn December 18, 2015, we entered into interest rate cap agreements that will effectively cap our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our existing senior secured term loans at 0.75% beginning June 30, 2016. We have designated these cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The initial aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,526.4 million and is scheduled to decrease each quarter beginning September 30, 2016, until the agreement terminates on June 30, 2020. Beginning July 2016, we will pay the various counter-parties a fixed rate of interest on the outstanding notional amounts of between 0.98% and 0.994% and receive payments to the extent LIBOR exceeds 0.75%. We will record the net payments paid or received as interest expense. The change in fair value of the caps is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive\nincome to the extent the caps are effective, and in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income to the extent the caps are ineffective. During December 2015, the change in the fair value of the caps resulted in a gain of $0.3 million recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax and a gain of $0.1 million recorded in other income and expense. Ineffectiveness is due to, and will continue to result from, financing the estimated cap premium payments. Amounts in other comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.\nEffect of certain debt covenants\nA breach of any of the covenants under the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to borrow funds under the senior secured revolving line of credit and could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders could elect to declare all amounts then outstanding to be immediately due and payable, and the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay the amounts declared due, the lenders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nWith certain exceptions, the obligations under the senior secured credit facility are secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of Trans Union LLC, including its investment in subsidiaries. The senior secured credit facility contains various restrictions and nonfinancial covenants, along with a senior secured net leverage ratio test. The nonfinancial covenants include restrictions on dividends, investments, dispositions, future borrowings and other specified payments, as well as additional reporting and disclosure requirements. The senior secured net leverage test must be met as a condition to incur additional indebtedness and at the end of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2015, this covenant required us to maintain a net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis equal to, or less than, 6.50-to-1. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.\nTransUnion's ability to meet its liquidity needs or to pay dividends on its common stock depends on its subsidiaries' earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, and other contractual restrictions. Trans Union LLC, the borrower under the senior secured credit facility, is not permitted to declare any dividend or make any other distribution subject to certain exceptions, including compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio and a basket that depends on TransUnion Intermediate's consolidated net income.\n11.375% Senior Notes\nThese notes were repaid in full on May 9, 2014, from the incremental proceeds borrowed on our senior secured credit facility and resulted in a net gain of $45.8 million recorded in other income and expense in 2014.\n9.625% and 8.125% Senior Notes\nThese notes were repaid in full on July 15, 2015 from the net proceeds from our IPO, along with the $350.0 million borrowings from the Senior Secured Term Loan A as discussed above.\nFor more information about our debt and the IPO transaction, see Part I, Item 1, Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements,\" Note 10 \"Debt,\" and Note 11, \"Stockholders' Equity.\"\nContractual Obligations\nConsolidated future minimum payments for noncancelable operating leases, purchase obligations and debt repayments as of December 31, 2015, are payable as follows:\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Operating\nleases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Purchase\nobligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Debt\nrepayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Loan fees\nand interest\npayments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>176.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>312.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>7.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>95.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>268.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>371.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,771.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,808.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,216.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>482.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,979.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase obligations include $105.4 million of trade accounts payable that were included in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Purchase obligations include commitments for outsourcing services, royalties, data licenses, maintenance and other operating expenses. Loan fees and interest payments are estimates based on the interest rates in effect at December 31, 2015, and the contractual principal paydown schedule, excluding any excess cash flow prepayments that may be required. See Part II, Item 8,\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 10, Debt,\u201d for additional information about our interest payments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The notes to our consolidated financial statements include disclosures about our significant accounting policies. These accounting policies require us to make certain judgments and estimates in reporting our operating results and our assets and liabilities. The following paragraphs describe the accounting policies that require significant judgment and estimates due to inherent uncertainty or complexity.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nIn connection with the acquisition of TransUnion Intermediate by TransUnion in April 2012, the value of goodwill increased significantly, as the excess of the purchase price paid for TransUnion Intermediate over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill and allocated to each of our reporting units.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $1,983.4 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had no other indefinite-lived intangible assets. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis if an indicator of impairment is present. For goodwill, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill. For other indefinite-lived intangibles, if any, we compare the fair value of the asset to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment. If the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded.\nWe use discounted cash flow techniques to determine the fair value of our reporting units, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangibles. The discounted cash flow calculation requires a number of significant assumptions, including projections of future cash flows, exchange rates and an estimate of the appropriate discount rates. The projections of future cash flows used to assess the fair value of the reporting units are based on the internal operating plans reviewed by management and significant shareholders. The projections of future exchange rates were based on the current exchange rates at the time the projections were prepared. The estimated discount rates were based on the risk-free rate of interest and estimated risk premiums for the reporting units at the time the impairment analysis was prepared. We believe our current estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. Such estimates are, however, inherently uncertain, and estimates using different assumptions could result in significantly different results, and a potential impairment charge for one or more of our reporting units that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no impairments of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets. As of December 31, 2015, our estimates of fair value for each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount of the corresponding reporting unit. A 10% increase in the discount rate or a 10% decrease in the estimated cash flows of the reporting unit would not have resulted in an impairment in any of the reporting units.\nLong-Lived Depreciable and Amortizable Assets\nIn connection with the acquisition of TransUnion Intermediate by TransUnion in April 2012, all long-lived depreciable and amortizable assets were recorded at fair value and the carrying value of certain fixed assets and all intangible assets increased significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet included fixed assets of $357.3 million, $183.0 million net of accumulated depreciation, and long-lived intangible assets of $2,385.4 million, $1,770.1 million net of accumulated amortization. We review long-lived assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet, and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. When a long-lived asset group is tested for recoverability, we also review depreciation estimates and methods. Any revision to the remaining useful life of a long-lived asset resulting from that review is also considered in developing estimates of future cash flows used to test the asset for recoverability. We typically use a discounted cash flow model when assessing the fair value of our\nasset groups. The discounted cash flow calculation requires a number of significant assumptions, including projections of future cash flows and an estimate of our discount rate.\nWhen events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, we use estimates of future cash flows to determine recoverability and base such estimates on assumptions that are reasonable and consistent with assumptions that would be used by other marketplace participants. Such estimates, however, are inherently uncertain and estimates using different assumptions, or different valuation techniques, could result in significantly different results. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no material impairment charges.\nLegal Contingencies\nAs of December 31, 2015, our consolidated balance sheet included an accrual of $16.3 million for pending or anticipated claims of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we are routinely named as defendants in, or party to, various legal actions and proceedings relating to our current or past business operations. These actions generally assert claims for violations of federal or state credit reporting, consumer protection or privacy laws, or common law claims related to privacy, libel, slander or the unfair treatment of consumers, and may include claims for substantial or indeterminate compensatory or punitive damages, or injunctive relief, and may seek business practice changes. In the ordinary course of business, we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal), certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In connection with formal and informal inquiries by these regulators, we routinely receive requests, subpoenas and orders seeking documents, testimony and other information in connection with various aspects of our activities. We regularly review all litigation and regulatory matters to determine whether a loss is probable and, if probable, whether the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, an appropriate reserve is accrued, taking into consideration legal positions, contractual obligations and applicable insurance coverages, and included in other current liabilities. We believe that the reserves established for pending or threatened legal and regulatory matters are appropriate based on the facts currently known. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the investigation and resolution of legal and regulatory matters, however, the actual costs of resolving litigation and regulatory matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved for those matters, and an adverse outcome in certain of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Legal fees incurred in connection with ongoing litigation are considered a period cost and are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2015, TransUnion's consolidated balance sheet included noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of $588.4 million. Certain deferred tax assets (including net operating loss carryforwards) may be deducted from taxable income in computing our federal income tax liability. If, in the future, we undergo an ownership change as described in Section 382(g) of the United States Internal Revenue Code, our ability to recover such deferred tax assets may be limited. Additionally, we are required to record current and deferred tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences, and unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on $118.4 million of unremitted earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that we assert are permanently reinvested in operations outside the United States. Remitting these earnings to the United States would result in additional tax expense that could be as high as approximately $42 million, assuming we cannot use any of the related foreign tax credits. As of December 31, 2015, we have made a provision for U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes of $43.2 million on $123.5 million of unremitted earnings from our Canadian, South African, Netherlands and Indian subsidiaries, as those earnings are not permanently reinvested outside the United States. We make certain judgments and estimates to determine the amounts recorded, including future tax rates, future taxable income, whether it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained, and the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit to record. We believe the judgments and estimates used are reasonable, but events may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of tax audits may differ significantly from what is expected.\nStock-Based Compensation\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recognized stock-based compensation of $22.3 million, $10.6 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The fair value of each award was determined by various methods including independent valuations of our common stock based on discounted cash flow and selected comparable public company analysis, the Black-Scholes valuation model, and risk-neutral Monte Carlo valuation models. The various valuation models required management to make a number of significant assumptions, including the fair value of our stock, projections of future cash flows and an estimate of our cost of capital, volatility rates, expected life of awards and risk-free interest rates. We believe the determinations of fair values were based on assumptions and estimates that were reasonable and consistent with what would have been used by other marketplace participants to determine fair value. Valuations, however, are inherently uncertain and valuations using different assumptions and estimates, or different valuation techniques, could result in significantly different values. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 14, Stock-Based Compensation,\u201d for additional information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information about recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\u201d Note 1, Significant Accounting and Reporting Policies.\u201d", "summary": "The report outlines TransUnion's financial condition and operations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of TransUnion's financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information,\u201d including TransUnion's audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to TransUnion and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including TransUnion Intermediate.\nOverview\nTransUnion is a leading global risk and information solutions provider to businesses and consumers. We provide consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. We are differentiated by our comprehensive and unique datasets, our next-generation technology and our analytics and decisioning capabilities, which enable us to deliver insights across the entire consumer lifecycle. We believe we are the largest provider of risk and information solutions in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, sometimes referred to as verticals, including financial services, insurance and healthcare. We have a global presence in over 30 countries across North America, Africa, Latin America and Asia.\nWe obtain financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from an average of 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our deep analytics expertise, which includes our people as well as tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enables businesses and consumers to gain better insights into their risk and financial data. Our decisioning capabilities, which are generally delivered on a software-as-a-service platform, allows businesses to interpret data and apply their specific qualifying criteria to make decisions and take action with respect to their customers. Collectively, our data, analytics and decisioning capabilities allow businesses to authenticate the identity of consumers, effectively determine the most relevant products for consumers, retain and cross-sell to existing consumers, identify and acquire new consumers and reduce loss from fraud. Similarly, our capabilities allow consumers to see how their credit profiles have changed over time, understand the impact of financial decisions on their credit scores and manage their personal information as well as to take precautions against identity theft.\nSegments\nWe manage our business and report our financial results in three operating segments: USIS, International and Consumer Interactive.\n \u2022 USIS provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical and decisioning services to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. The core capabilities and delivery platforms in our USIS segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers and business issues. We offer our services to customers in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries. \n \u2022 The International segment provides services similar to our USIS segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and decisioning services and other value-added risk management services. In addition, we have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, insurance, automotive, collections and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment that help consumers proactively manage their personal finances. \n \u2022 Consumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution and financial management. Our products are provided through user friendly online and mobile interfaces and supported \nby educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels.\nIn addition, Corporate provides shared services for the Company and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the operating segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically for enterprise-level functions and are primarily administrative in nature.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nThe following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, our results of operations:\nMacroeconomic and Industry Trends\nOur revenues are significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including the availability of affordable credit and capital, interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. Since the beginning of 2014, we have seen continuing signs of improved economic conditions and increased market stabilization. In the United States, we also saw improvement in the consumer lending market, including mortgage refinancings resulting from low long-term mortgage rates, an improving housing market, increased auto loans, a decrease in unemployment, an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in demand for our marketing services. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we continue to see increased demand for our credit and identity theft solutions. These factors helped drive improved financial results in all of our segments in 2015 and 2014. The economic and market improvements were tempered by continuing concern about economic conditions that has limited consumer spending and has put pressure on growth in our businesses. Also, during the first quarter of 2014, North America had several weeks of extreme cold-weather conditions which negatively impacted revenue for that period. In addition, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar has diminished the operating results reported by our International operations during 2015 and 2014.\nOur revenues are also significantly influenced by industry trends, including the demand for information services in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries we serve. Companies are increasingly relying on business analytics and big-data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. As customers have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data generated by their own activities, they are increasingly expecting access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked customers. Demand for consumer solutions is rising with higher consumer awareness of the importance and usage of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and more readily available free credit information. The increasing number and complexity of regulations, including new capital requirements and the Dodd-Frank Act, make operations for businesses more challenging.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRecent Developments\nIn June 2015, in anticipation of our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), our board of directors authorized and we effected a 1.333 to 1 stock split of our common stock. All periods presented in this report reflect the split.\nIn June 2015, we entered into amendments to refinance the senior secured credit facility with a new $1,881.0 million term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan B\"). Among other things, the amendments lowered the interest rate floor and modified the step-down interest rate margin based on achieving certain total leverage ratios and senior secured net leverage ratios. The amendments also included a new $350.0 million five-year senior secured term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan A\") and refinanced the existing revolving line of credit and replaced it with a five-year $210.0 million revolving line of credit.\nOn June 30, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 33,977,273 shares, including 4,431,818 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $714.7 million. On July 15, 2015, we used the net proceeds, along with the $350.0 million borrowings from the Senior Secured Term Loan A, to redeem all of the outstanding 9.625% and 8.125% Senior Notes. Collectively the refinance and redemptions resulted in $37.6 million of expense recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income in 2015, including a prepayment premium, accrued interest, the write-off of unamortized deferred debt fees and discounts, and certain transaction costs.\nOn December 18, 2015, we entered into interest rate cap agreements that will effectively cap our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our existing senior secured term loans at 0.75% beginning June 30, 2016. We have designated these cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The initial aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,526.4 million and is scheduled to decrease each quarter beginning September 30, 2016, until the agreement terminates on June 30, 2020. Beginning July 2016, we will pay the various counter-parties a fixed rate of interest on the outstanding notional amounts of between 0.98% and 0.994% and receive payments to the extent LIBOR exceeds 0.75%. We will record the net payments paid or received as interest expense. The change in fair value of the caps is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to the extent the caps are effective, and in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income to the extent the caps are ineffective.\nRecent Acquisitions and Partnerships\nWe selectively evaluate acquisitions and partnerships as a means to expand our business and international footprint and to enter new markets. During the past three years we completed the following acquisitions:\n \u2022 On December 9, 2015, we acquired 100% of the voting share capital in Trustev Limited (\"Trustev\"). Trustev is a registered company in the Republic of Ireland that provides digital verification technology to multiple industries. The results of operations of Trustev, which are not material, have been included as part of our USIS segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition. \n \u2022 During 2015, we increased our equity interest in Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ( CIBIL\u201d) from 55% to 66.1%, with a 5% additional purchase on September 24, 2015 and a 6.1% additional purchase on November 5, 2015. \n \u2022 On October 21, 2015, we acquired the remaining 49% equity interest in Databusiness S.A., our Chile subsidiary. We no longer record net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income or redeemable noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheets from the date we acquired the remaining interest. \n \u2022 During January 2015, we acquired the remaining equity interests in our two Brazilian subsidiaries, Data Solutions Servi\u00e7os de Inform\u00e1tica Ltda. ( ZipCode\u201d) and Crivo Sistemas em Inform\u00e1tica S.A. ( Crivo\u201d). We no longer record net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income or redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets from the date we acquired the remaining interests. \n \u2022 On November 12, 2014, we acquired an 87.5% ownership interest in Drivers History Information Sales, LLC (\"DHI\"). DHI collects traffic violation and criminal court data. The results of operations of DHI, which are not material, have been included as part of our USIS segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of acquisition. \n \u2022 On October 17, 2014, we increased our equity interest in L2C, Inc. (\"2C\") from 11.6% to 100%. L2C provides predictive analytics generally focused on the unbanked market using alternative data. The results of operations of L2C, which are not material, have been included as part of our USIS segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date we obtained control. \n \u2022 In 2014, we increased our equity interest in CIBIL from 27.5% to 55.0%. This additional purchase gave us control and resulted in our consolidation of CIBIL.

The results of operations of ZipCode, which are not \nmaterial, have been included as part of our International segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition.\nKey Components of Our Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our USIS segment revenue from three operating platforms: Online Data Services, Marketing Services and Decision Services. Online Data Services encompass services delivered in real-time using both credit and public record datasets. We also provide online reports that link public record datasets for qualified businesses seeking to locate consumers, specific assets or investigate relationships among consumers, businesses and locations. Collectively, the reports, characteristics and scores, with variations tailored for specific industries, form the basis of Online Data Services. We also provide online services to help businesses manage fraud and authenticate a consumer's identity when they initiate a new business relationship. Additionally, we provide data to businesses to help them satisfy know your customer\u201d compliance requirements and to confirm an individual's identity. Marketing Services help our customers develop marketing lists of prospects via direct mail, web and mobile. Our databases are used by our customers to contact individuals to extend firm offers of credit or insurance. We provide portfolio review services, which are periodic reviews of our customers' existing accounts, to help our customers develop cross-selling offers to their existing customers and monitor and manage risk in their existing consumer portfolios. We also provide trigger services which are daily notifications of changes to a consumer profile. Decision Services, our software-as-a-service offerings, includes a number of platforms that help businesses interpret data and predictive model results and apply their customer-specific criteria to facilitate real-time automated decisions at the time of customer interaction. Our customers use Decision Services to evaluate business risks and opportunities, including those associated with new consumer credit and checking accounts, insurance applications, account collection, patient registrations and apartment rental requests.\nWe report our International segment revenue in two categories: developed markets and emerging markets. Our developed markets are Canada and Hong Kong. Our emerging markets include Africa, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India. In 2014, we reclassified Puerto Rico to emerging markets to align it with the rest of the Latin America region. Prior years' revenue has been reclassified accordingly.\nConsumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution and financial management. Our products are provided through user friendly online and mobile interfaces and supported by educational content and customer support.\nCost of Services\nCosts of services include data acquisition and royalty fees, costs related to our databases and software applications, consumer and call center support costs, hardware and software maintenance costs, telecommunication expenses and occupancy costs associated with the facilities where these functions are performed.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel-related costs for sales, administrative and management employees, costs for professional and consulting services, advertising and occupancy and facilities expense of these functions.\nNon-Operating Income and Expense\nNon-operating income and expense includes interest expense, interest income, earnings from equity-method investments, dividends from cost-method investments, expenses related to successful and unsuccessful business acquisitions, loan fees, debt refinancing expenses, certain acquisition-related gains and losses and other non-operating income and expenses.\nResults of Operations-Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013\nKey Performance Measures\nManagement, including our chief operating decision maker, evaluates the financial performance of our businesses based on a variety of key indicators. These indicators include the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA and the GAAP measures revenue, cash provided by operating activities and cash paid for capital expenditures. In order to more closely align the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to the definition we use as a supplemental measure of our operating performance as well as a compensation measure under our incentive plan, we have included additional adjustments to our previously defined Adjusted EBITDA. Such additional adjustments consist of expenses for mergers and acquisitions integration, business optimization, our technology transformation project, operating expense tax matters, consulting study fees related to our strategic initiatives and other expenses. All periods have been presented in the table below under our new definition of Adjusted EBITDA. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, these key indicators were as follows:\n\nnm: not meaningful\n 1. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to the Company before net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization and other adjustments noted in the table above. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. In addition, our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure under our incentive compensation plan. Furthermore, under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other income and expense. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income attributable to the Company. The table above provides a reconciliation from our net income (loss) attributable to the Company to Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. \n 2. Consisted of stock-based compensation and cash-settled stock-based compensation. \n 3. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following adjustments to operating income: a $(0.1) million reduction in contingent consideration expense from previous acquisitions, $2.1 million of business optimization expenses, and a $0.3 million loss on divestiture of a business operation. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following adjustments to non-operating income and expense: $5.8 million of acquisition expenses and $(0.1) million of miscellaneous.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, consisted of the following adjustments to non-operating income and expenses: $10.5 million of acquisition expenses; $(2.5) million of gains on cost and equity method investments that were disposed of and $0.6 million of miscellaneous.\n 4. Represented costs associated with a project to transform our technology infrastructure. \n 5. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following adjustments to operating income: $(0.5) million of miscellaneous. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, consisted of the following adjustments to non-operating income and expense: $37.6 million of debt refinancing expenses; $3.6 million of currency remeasurement of our foreign operations; $0.7 million of losses related to mark-to-market ineffectiveness of our interest rate hedge; $1.4 million of loan fees; and $0.7 million of miscellaneous.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, consisted of the following adjustments to non-operating income and\nexpenses: $2.5 million of debt refinancing expenses; $0.8 million of currency remeasurement of our foreign operations; $1.4 million of loan fees; and $1.4 million of miscellaneous.\nRevenue\nFor 2015, revenue increased $202.1 million compared with 2014, due to strong organic growth in all of our segments and revenue from our 2015 and 2014 acquisitions in our USIS and International segments, partially offset by the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the 2015 revenue of our international segment. Acquisitions accounted for an increase in revenue of 1.8%. The impact of weakening foreign currencies accounted for a decrease in revenue of 2.8%. For 2014, revenue increased $121.5 million compared with 2013 due to revenue from our 2014 and 2013 acquisitions in our USIS and International segments and organic growth in all of our segments, partially offset by the impact of weakening foreign currencies on the 2014 revenue of our International segment. Acquisitions accounted for an increase in revenue of 6.4%. The impact of weakening foreign currencies accounted for a decrease in revenue of 1.4%. Revenue by segment and a more detailed explanation of revenue within each segment are as follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of TransUnion's financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors,\u201d Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information,\u201d including TransUnion's audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. In addition to historical data, this discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and financial performance based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those discussed in Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\u201d\nReferences in this discussion and analysis to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to TransUnion and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including TransUnion Intermediate.\nOverview\nTransUnion is a leading global risk and information solutions provider to businesses and consumers. We provide consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decisioning capabilities to businesses. Businesses embed our solutions into their process workflows to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. Consumers use our solutions to view their credit profiles and access analytical tools that help them understand and manage their personal information and take precautions against identity theft. We are differentiated by our comprehensive and unique datasets, our next-generation technology and our analytics and decisioning capabilities, which enable us to deliver insights across the entire consumer lifecycle. We believe we are the largest provider of risk and information solutions in the United States to possess both nationwide consumer credit data and comprehensive, diverse public records data, which allows us to better predict behaviors, assess risk and address a broader set of business issues for our customers. We have deep domain expertise across a number of attractive industries, sometimes referred to as verticals, including financial services, insurance and healthcare. We have a global presence in over 30 countries across North America, Africa, Latin America and Asia.\nWe obtain financial, credit, alternative credit, identity, bankruptcy, lien, judgment, insurance claims, automotive and other relevant information from an average of 90,000 data sources, including financial institutions, private databases and public records repositories. We refine, standardize and enhance this data using sophisticated algorithms to create proprietary databases. Our deep analytics expertise, which includes our people as well as tools such as predictive modeling and scoring, customer segmentation, benchmarking and forecasting, enables businesses and consumers to gain better insights into their risk and financial data. Our decisioning capabilities, which are generally delivered on a software-as-a-service platform, allows businesses to interpret data and apply their specific qualifying criteria to make decisions and take action with respect to their customers. Collectively, our data, analytics and decisioning capabilities allow businesses to authenticate the identity of consumers, effectively determine the most relevant products for consumers, retain and cross-sell to existing consumers, identify and acquire new consumers and reduce loss from fraud. Similarly, our capabilities allow consumers to see how their credit profiles have changed over time, understand the impact of financial decisions on their credit scores and manage their personal information as well as to take precautions against identity theft.\nSegments\nWe manage our business and report our financial results in three operating segments: USIS, International and Consumer Interactive.\n \u2022 USIS provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical and decisioning services to businesses. These businesses use our services to acquire new customers, assess consumer ability to pay for services, identify cross-selling opportunities, measure and manage debt portfolio risk, collect debt, verify consumer identities and investigate potential fraud. The core capabilities and delivery platforms in our USIS segment allow us to serve a broad set of customers and business issues. We offer our services to customers in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries. \n \u2022 The International segment provides services similar to our USIS segment to businesses in select regions outside the United States. Depending on the maturity of the credit economy in each country, services may include credit reports, analytics and decisioning services and other value-added risk management services. In addition, we have insurance, business and automotive databases in select geographies. These services are offered to customers in a number of industries including financial services, insurance, automotive, collections and communications, and are delivered through both direct and indirect channels. The International segment also provides consumer services similar to those offered by our Consumer Interactive segment that help consumers proactively manage their personal finances. \n \u2022 Consumer Interactive offers solutions that help consumers manage their personal finances and take precautions against identity theft. Services in this segment include credit reports and scores, credit monitoring, fraud protection and resolution and financial management. Our products are provided through user friendly online and mobile interfaces and supported \nby educational content and customer support. Our Consumer Interactive segment serves consumers through both direct and indirect channels.\nIn addition, Corporate provides shared services for the Company and conducts enterprise functions. Certain costs incurred in Corporate that are not directly attributable to one or more of the operating segments remain in Corporate. These costs are typically for enterprise-level functions and are primarily administrative in nature.\nFactors Affecting Our Results of Operations\nThe following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, our results of operations:\nMacroeconomic and Industry Trends\nOur revenues are significantly influenced by general macroeconomic conditions, including the availability of affordable credit and capital, interest rates, inflation, employment levels, consumer confidence and housing demand. Since the beginning of 2014, we have seen continuing signs of improved economic conditions and increased market stabilization. In the United States, we also saw improvement in the consumer lending market, including mortgage refinancings resulting from low long-term mortgage rates, an improving housing market, increased auto loans, a decrease in unemployment, an increase in consumer confidence and an increase in demand for our marketing services. In our Consumer Interactive segment, we continue to see increased demand for our credit and identity theft solutions. These factors helped drive improved financial results in all of our segments in 2015 and 2014. The economic and market improvements were tempered by continuing concern about economic conditions that has limited consumer spending and has put pressure on growth in our businesses. Also, during the first quarter of 2014, North America had several weeks of extreme cold-weather conditions which negatively impacted revenue for that period. In addition, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar has diminished the operating results reported by our International operations during 2015 and 2014.\nOur revenues are also significantly influenced by industry trends, including the demand for information services in financial services, insurance, healthcare and other industries we serve. Companies are increasingly relying on business analytics and big-data technologies to help process this data in a cost-efficient manner. As customers have gained the ability to rapidly aggregate and analyze data generated by their own activities, they are increasingly expecting access to real-time data and analytics from their information providers as well as solutions that fully integrate into their workflows. As economies in emerging markets continue to develop and mature, we believe there will continue to be favorable socio-economic trends, such as an increase in the size of the middle class and a significant increase in the use of financial services by under-served and under-banked customers. Demand for consumer solutions is rising with higher consumer awareness of the importance and usage of their credit information, increased risk of identity theft due to data breaches and more readily available free credit information. The increasing number and complexity of regulations, including new capital requirements and the Dodd-Frank Act, make operations for businesses more challenging.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRecent Developments\nIn June 2015, in anticipation of our initial public offering (\"IPO\"), our board of directors authorized and we effected a 1.333 to 1 stock split of our common stock. All periods presented in this report reflect the split.\nIn June 2015, we entered into amendments to refinance the senior secured credit facility with a new $1,881.0 million term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan B\"). Among other things, the amendments lowered the interest rate floor and modified the step-down interest rate margin based on achieving certain total leverage ratios and senior secured net leverage ratios. The amendments also included a new $350.0 million five-year senior secured term loan (\"Senior Secured Term Loan A\") and refinanced the existing revolving line of credit and replaced it with a five-year $210.0 million revolving line of credit.\nOn June 30, 2015, we completed our initial public offering of 33,977,273 shares, including 4,431,818 shares pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $22.50 per share. Proceeds from the IPO, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $714.7 million. On July 15, 2015, we used the net proceeds, along with the $350.0 million borrowings from the Senior Secured Term Loan A, to redeem all of the outstanding 9.625% and 8.125% Senior Notes. Collectively the refinance and redemptions resulted in $37.6 million of expense recorded in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income in 2015, including a prepayment premium, accrued interest, the write-off of unamortized deferred debt fees and discounts, and certain transaction costs.\nOn December 18, 2015, we entered into interest rate cap agreements that will effectively cap our LIBOR exposure on a portion of our existing senior secured term loans at 0.75% beginning June 30, 2016. We have designated these cap agreements as cash flow hedges. The initial aggregate notional amount under these agreements is $1,526.4 million and is scheduled to decrease each quarter beginning September 30, 2016, until the agreement terminates on June 30, 2020. Beginning July 2016, we will pay the various counter-parties a fixed rate of interest on the outstanding notional amounts of between 0.98% and 0.994% and receive payments to the extent LIBOR exceeds 0.75%. We will record the net payments paid or received as interest expense. The change in fair value of the caps is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income to the extent the caps are effective, and in other income and expense in the consolidated statements of income to the extent the caps are ineffective.\nRecent Acquisitions and Partnerships\nWe selectively evaluate acquisitions and partnerships as a means to expand our business and international footprint and to enter new markets. During the past three years we completed the following acquisitions:\n \u2022 On December 9, 2015, we acquired 100% of the voting share capital in Trustev Limited (\"Trustev\"). Trustev is a registered company in the Republic of Ireland that provides digital verification technology to multiple industries. The results of operations of Trustev, which are not material, have been included as part of our USIS segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date of the acquisition. \n \u2022 During 2015, we increased our equity interest in Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ( CIBIL\u201d) from 55% to 66.1%, with a 5% additional purchase on September 24, 2015 and a 6.1% additional purchase on November 5, 2015. \n \u2022 On October 21, 2015, we acquired the remaining 49% equity interest in Databusiness S.A., our Chile subsidiary.

The results of operations of L2C, which are not material, have been included as part of our USIS segment in our consolidated statements of income since the date we obtained control. \n \u2022 In 2014, we increased our equity interest in CIBIL from 27.5% to 55.0%. This additional purchase gave us control and resulted in our consolidation of CIBIL. CIBIL's results of operations, which are not material, are included as part of our International segment in our consolidated statements of income since May 21, 2014, the date we obtained control. \n \u2022 Effective January 1, 2014, we acquired the remaining 30% equity interest in our Guatemala subsidiary, Trans Union Guatemala, S.A. (TransUnion Guatemala) from the minority shareholders. We no longer record net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated statements of income or redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets from the date we acquired the remaining interests. \n \u2022 On December 16, 2013, we acquired a 100% ownership interest in certain assets of TLO, LLC (\"TLO\").

meaningful\n 1. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to the Company before net interest expense, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization and other adjustments noted in the table above. We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. Also, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours. In addition, our board of directors and executive management team use Adjusted EBITDA as a compensation measure under our incentive compensation plan. Furthermore, under the credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends is tied to a ratio based on Adjusted EBITDA. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt.\u201d Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our capital expenditures, interest, income tax, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation and certain other income and expense. Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial condition or profitability under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance. We believe that the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EBITDA is net income attributable to the Company. The table above provides a reconciliation from our net income (loss) attributable to the Company to Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. \n 2.
