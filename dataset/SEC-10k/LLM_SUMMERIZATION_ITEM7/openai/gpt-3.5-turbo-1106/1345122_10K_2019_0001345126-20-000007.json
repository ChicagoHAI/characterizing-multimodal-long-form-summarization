MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently deem immaterial could also cause our actual results to differ, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nCompass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust, was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, was also formed on November 18, 2005. In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust is sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests (as defined in the LLC Agreement) of the Company and, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Company has outstanding, the identical number of Trust Interests as the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Sostratus LLC owns all of our Allocation Interests. The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities, similar to that of a Delaware corporation.\nThe Trust and the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. We characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $75 million. We focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more amenable to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow.\nIn pursuing new acquisitions, we seek businesses with the following characteristics:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>North American base of operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>stable and growing earnings and cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a reason to exist\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a diversified customer and supplier base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our management team's strategy for our subsidiaries involves:\nTable 191: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract, recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies (both revenue and cost related);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors, including independent directors, to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well- positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses. Our management team has a large network of approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team's active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. In consummating transactions, our management team has, in the past, been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with\na strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\nIn addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.\nInitial public offering and Company formation\nOn May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust at an offering price of $15.00 per share (the IPO\u201d). Subsequent to the IPO the Company's board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company.\nFrom May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2019, we purchased nineteen businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of ten businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAcquisitions\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ownership Interest - December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CODI Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBS Holdings (Staffmark) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crosman (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Circuits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silvue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tridien (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aeroglide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Halo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Furniture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 4, 2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liberty Safe (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ergobaby (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 16, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CamelBak\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 24, 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arnold Magnetics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 5, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Earth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 7, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sterno (3) (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 10, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manitoba Harvest (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 10, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.58%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Velocity Outdoor (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foam Fabricators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The total purchase price for CBS Holdings includes the acquisition of Staffmark Investment LLC in January 2008 for a purchase price of $128.6 million.

In July 2014, FOX completed a secondary offering in which we sold a 12% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership\ninterest to 41% and resulting in the deconsolidation of FOX from our financial results. We subsequently sold our remaining shares of FOX and now hold no ownership interest in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sale of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million.\n(5) The total purchase price of Sterno includes the acquisition of Rimports in February 2018 for a purchase price of $154.4 million.\nDispositions\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Date of Disposition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sale Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CODI Proceeds from Disposition (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Gain (loss) recognized (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crosman\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 5, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aeroglide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 24, 2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silvue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 25, 2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>95,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Staffmark\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 17, 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>295,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>216,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Halo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 1, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(300\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CamelBak\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 3, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>412,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Furniture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 5, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tridien\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 21, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>526,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manitoba Harvest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>294,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>219,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Earth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 28, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>625,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>551,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) CODI portion of the net proceeds from disposition includes debt and equity proceeds and reflects the accounting for the redemption of the sold business's minority shareholders and transaction expenses.\n(2) Gain (loss) recognized on sale of our businesses is calculated by deducting our total invested capital from the net sale proceeds received.\n(3) Sale price of Manitoba Harvest was C$370 million. Translation to USD is as of the date of sale.\n* We made loans to and purchased a controlling interest in FOX on January 4, 2008, for approximately $80.4 million. In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of $61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of $428.7 million.\nWe are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and distributions of our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and distributions, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fund distributions from the businesses to the Company; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>be distributed by the Trust to shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 Highlights and Recent Events\nRepayment of 2018 Term Loan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $193.8 million of the 2018 Term Loan in July 2019, and the remaining $298.8 million balance due under the 2018 Term loan in November 2019. In connection with the repayment, we recorded $8.9 million in expense associated with the deferred financing costs that we had previously capitalized associated with the 2018 Term Loan, and $3.4 million in expense associated with the original issue discount on the 2018 Term Loan. We had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $220 million that was effective April 1, 2016 through June 6, 2021, the original termination date of our 2014 Term Loan. We terminated the interest rate swap in connection with the repayment of the 2018 Term Loan, resulting in a payment of $4.9 million.\nTrust Preferred Share Issuance\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Trust issued 4,600,000 7.875% Series C Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $115.0 million, or $111.0 million net of underwriters' discount and issuance costs. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears, when and as declared by the Company's board of directors on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, beginning on January 30, 2020. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Shares are cumulative.\nSale of Clean Earth\nOn May 8, 2019, the Company, as majority stockholder of CEHI Acquisition Corporation (\"Clean Earth\" or CEHI\u201d) and as Sellers' Representative, entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Calrissian Holdings, LLC ( Buyer\u201d), CEHI, the other holders of stock and options of CEHI and, as Buyer's guarantor, Harsco Corporation, pursuant to which Buyer would acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of CEHI, the parent company of the operating entity, Clean Earth, Inc.\nOn June 28, 2019, Buyer completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding securities of CEHI pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The sale price for Clean Earth was based on an aggregate total enterprise value of $625 million and is subject to customary working capital adjustments. After the allocation of the sale proceeds to Clean Earth non-controlling equity holders and the payment of transaction expenses of approximately $10.7 million, we received approximately $552 million of total proceeds at closing related to our debt and equity interests in Clean Earth. We recognized a gain on the sale of Clean Earth of $209.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a discussion of the profit allocation associated with the sale of Clean Earth.\nSale of Manitoba Harvest\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Tilray, Inc. (\"Tilray\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, 1197879 B.C. Ltd. ( Tilray Subco\u201d), to sell to Tilray, through Tilray Subco, all of the issued and outstanding securities of our majority owned subsidiary, Manitoba Harvest for total consideration of up to C$419 million. The completion of the sale of Manitoba Harvest was subject to approval by the British Columbia Supreme Court, which occurred on February 21, 2019. The sale closed on February 28, 2019. Subject to certain customary adjustments, the shareholders of Manitoba Harvest, including the Company, received the following from Tilray as consideration for their shares of Manitoba Harvest: (i) C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of Manitoba Harvest and the holders of common shares of Manitoba Harvest ( Common Holders\u201d) and C$127.5 million in shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray ( Tilray Common Stock\u201d) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the sale (the Closing Date Consideration\u201d), and (ii) C$50 million in cash and C$42.5 million in Tilray Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that was six months after the closing date of the arrangement (the Deferred Consideration\u201d). The sale consideration also included a potential earnout of up to C$49 million in Tilray Common Stock to the Common Holders, if Manitoba Harvest achieved certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols prior to December 31, 2019. The threshold for the earnout was not achieved and no additional amount was recorded related to sale of Manitoba Harvest at December 31, 2019.\nThe cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration was reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness (including accrued interest) of Manitoba Harvest on the closing date of C$71.3 million ($53.7 million) and transaction expenses of approximately C$5.0 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of Manitoba Harvest of $121.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a discussion of the profit allocation associated with the sale of Manitoba Harvest. Our share of the net proceeds after accounting for the redemption of the noncontrolling shareholders and the payment of net indebtedness of Manitoba Harvest and transaction expenses was approximately $124.2 million in cash proceeds and in Tilray Common Stock. In August 2019, the Company received the Deferred\nConsideration related to the sale. The Company's portion of the Deferred Consideration totaled $28.4 million in cash proceeds and $19.6 million in Tilray Common Stock.\nThe Tilray Common Stock consideration was issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, such that any shares of Tilray Common Stock received by the Common Holders were freely tradeable. We sold the Tilray Common Stock received as part of the Closing Consideration during March 2019, recognizing a net loss of $5.3 million in Other income (expense) during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. In August 2019, the Company sold the Tilray Common Stock received as part of the Deferred Consideration, recognizing a loss of $4.9 million in Other income/ (expense) during the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n2019 Distributions\nCommon shares - For the 2019 fiscal year we declared distributions to our common shareholders totaling $1.44 per share.\nPreferred shares - For the 2019 fiscal year we declared distributions to our preferred shareholders totaling $1.8125 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares and $1.96875 on our Series B Preferred Shares. We also declared a distribution to our preferred shareholders of $0.38281 per share on our Series C Preferred Shares. The distribution on the Series C Preferred Shares covers the period from, and including, November 20, 2019, the original issue date of the Series C Preferred Shares, up to, but excluding, January 30, 2020.\n2020 Outlook and Significant Trends\nDuring 2019, the middle market continued to be an active segment for deal flow, with continued strong deal flow expected in 2020. High valuation levels continue to be driven by the availability of debt capital with favorable terms and financial and strategic buyers seeking to deploy available equity capital. We believe that companies will focus on expanding their customer bases by diversifying their products and services in existing geographic areas during 2020.\nWe remain focused on marketing the Company's attractive ownership and management attributes to potential sellers of middle market businesses and intermediaries. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for add-on acquisitions by certain of our existing subsidiary companies, which can be particularly attractive from a strategic perspective.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2020, we anticipate our niche industrial companies, combined as a whole, will continue to grow revenue and earnings as a result of the overall health of the economy. Our branded consumer companies, combined as a whole, may be impacted in 2019 by the continued weakening in the U.S. retail landscape, specifically, lower consumer foot traffic in brick and mortar retail, and the related shift to more online shopping. We believe our branded consumer companies, with their strong positions in their respective markets and powerful brands, remain well positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019, notwithstanding this difficult landscape.\nThe areas of focus for 2020, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution and international expansion;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations of our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and components of the results of operations as well as those components presented as a percent of net revenues, for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis.\nWe acquired Foam Fabricators in February 2018, Velocity Outdoor in June 2017, and our Sterno business acquired Rimports in February 2018. In the following results of operations, we provide (i) our actual Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which includes the historical results of operations of each of our businesses (operating segments) from the date of acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\" or \"US GAAP\") and (ii) comparative historical components of the results of operations for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis ( Results of Operations - Our Businesses\u201d), for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, where all years presented include relevant pro-forma adjustments for pre-acquisition periods and explanations where applicable. For the 2018 acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2017. The historical operating results of Rimports have been added to the previously reported Sterno results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Sterno results of operations for the 2018 period prior to acquisition by Sterno. For the 2017 acquisition of Velocity Outdoor, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased this business on January 1, 2017. We believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results. The following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, going forward.\nAll dollar amounts in the financial tables are presented in thousands.

Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $11.6 million and $33.1 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at 5.11 ($40.7 million), Liberty ($13.5 million) and Velocity ($16.5 million increase as a result of the Ravin acquisition in September 2018). These increases in\nrevenue were partially offset by a decrease in net sales at our Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($16.8 million decrease) in 2019 as compared to 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $43.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $6.9 million and $20.8 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2018. We also saw notable increases in cost of sales at 5.11 ($9.9 million), Liberty ($12.1 million) and Velocity ($10.3 million) corresponding to the increase in net sales noted above. This was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales at our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports of $16.3 million.\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 35.8% in year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 34.6% in 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $15.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $14.3 million in 2018 to $14.9 million in 2019, primarily due to transaction costs associated with an unsuccessful acquisition.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $37.0 million in expense for these fees compared to $43.4 million for the corresponding period in 2018. The $6.4 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2019 is principally due to the sales of Manitoba Harvest in the first quarter of 2019 and Clean earth in the second quarter of 2019. Concurrent with the June 2019 sale of Clean Earth, CGM agree to waive the management fee on cash balances held at the Company, commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 and continuing until the quarter in which the Company next borrows under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $4.5 million to $54.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018, and Ravin in September 2018.\nImpairment expense\nVelocity Outdoor performed an interim impairment test of their goodwill during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 as a result of operating results below forecasts in the current period as well as a re-forecast of the Velocity business in which planned earnings and revenue fell below the forecasts of prior periods. The impairment test resulted in Velocity Outdoor recording impairment expense of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded interest expense totaling $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $55.2 million for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of $3.0 million. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects the interest associated with the issuance of our Senior Notes in April 2018. We recorded $32.0 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $22.5 million in interest expense for the period from the date of issuance through December 31, 2018 related to the Senior Notes. This increase in interest expense as a result of the full year\nof interest associated with the Senior Notes was offset by a decrease in the average amount outstanding on our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, which we paid off in June 2019 and did not draw on again during 2019, and the repayment of our 2018 Term Loan during the latter half of 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had income tax expense of $14.7 million with an effective income tax rate of 56.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to income tax expense of $10.5 million with an effective income tax rate of 124.4% during the same period in 2018. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 includes a loss at our parent company, which is taxed as a partnership. Although we had a greater loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 ($26.0 million loss in 2019 and $8.4 million loss in 2018), our income tax provision increased by $4.3 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. This increase in the income tax provision was primarily a result of a decrease in the utilization of tax credits in fiscal year 2019, and the goodwill impairment related to Velocity, a portion of which was nondeductible for tax purposes. In the prior year, the effect of the recapitalization at Sterno and state income taxes as well as the geographic mix of income had a significant impact on our effective tax rate.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by approximately $354.5 million or 35.4% compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $113.4 million and $145.6 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $52.9 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at 5.11 ($37.9 million), Arnold ($12.3 million) and our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($9.4 million). These increases in revenue were partially offset by decreases in net revenue at Liberty ($9.3 million) and Ergo ($12.4 million) in 2018 as compared to 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $246.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $82.6 million and $110.5 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, while our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017 contributed $35.3 million to the increase, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. Our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports had an increase in cost of revenues of $9.3 million, and Arnold had an increase in cost of revenues of $8.6 million, both in line with the increase in revenues at these entities. These increases were offset by decreases in cost of revenues at other operating segments, particularly Ergo ($3.1 million decrease) and Liberty ($3.3 million decrease).\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 34.6% in year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 36.0% in 2017. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $58.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The increase in expenses in 2018 compared to 2017 is principally the result of the acquisition of Foam Fabricators ($12.3 million including $1.6 million in acquisition costs), Rimports ($4.0 million, including $0.6 million in acquisition costs) and Velocity Outdoor ($10.4 million) reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2017, as well as the acquisition of Ravin in September 2018 and acquisition costs related to Ravin of $1.4 million. We also saw notable increases in selling, general and\nadministrative year-over-year at 5.11 ($22.2 million). Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $12.7 million in 2017 to $14.3 million in 2018, primarily due to increased professional fees associated with governance and compliance costs related to the implementation of new accounting standards.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred approximately $43.4 million in expense for these fees compared to $31.8 million for the corresponding period in 2017. The $11.6 million increase in the year ended December 31, 2018 is principally due to the increase in consolidated net assets resulting from the acquisition of Foam Fabricators in February 2018, and the add-on acquisitions by our businesses that occurred throughout 2018.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $15.0 million to $49.7 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded interest expense totaling $55.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $27.3 million for the comparable period in 2017, an increase of $28.0 million. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects the interest associated with the issuance of our Senior Notes in April 2018 and the increase in the amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility in fiscal year 2018. We recorded $22.5 million in interest expense for the period from the date of issuance through December 31, 2018 related to the Senior Notes. The average amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility in 2017 was $33.6 million, while the average amount outstanding during 2018 was $205.1 million as a result of our add-on acquisitions that occurred in 2018. Our interest expense also reflects the effect of the unrealized gains or losses on our interest rate swap. In 2018 and 2017, we recognized unrealized gains of $2.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, which reduced our interest expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe had income tax expense of $10.5 million with an effective income tax rate of 124.4% during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to income tax benefit of $23.7 million with an effective income tax rate of (246.5%) during the same period in 2017. The effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 includes a loss at our parent company, which is taxed as a partnership. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. Among other changes of the Tax Act, the tax rate on corporations was reduced from 35% to 21%; a limitation on the deduction of interest expense was enacted, certain tangible property acquired after September 2017 will qualify for 100% expensing, U.S federal income tax on foreign earnings was eliminated (subject to certain exceptions) and a new base erosion anti-tax abuse tax were added. Although the Company is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each of our businesses was affected by the Tax Act, and the resulting impact significantly affected the calculation of our year-to-date consolidated income tax provision in 2018 and 2017. Additionally, in fiscal year 2018, the effect of the recapitalization at Sterno and state income taxes as well as the geographic mix of income had a significant impact on our effective tax rate. In the prior year, the impairment expense at our Arnold business and non-deductible costs at the corporate level, including the effect of the loss on our equity investment of FOX prior to the sale of our remaining FOX shares in the first quarter of 2017, account for the majority of the remaining difference in our effective income tax rates year over year.\nResults of Operations - Our Businesses\nWe categorize the businesses we own into two separate groups of businesses (i) branded consumer businesses, and (ii) niche industrial businesses. Branded consumer businesses are characterized as those businesses that we believe capitalize on a valuable brand name in their respective market sector. We believe that our branded consumer businesses are leaders in their particular category. Niche industrial businesses are characterized as those businesses that focus on manufacturing and selling particular products or services within a specific market sector. We believe that our niche industrial businesses are leaders in their specific market sector.\nBranded Consumer Businesses\n5.11\nOverview\n5.11 is a leading provider of purpose-built technical apparel and gear for law enforcement, firefighters, EMS, and military special operations as well as outdoor and adventure enthusiasts. 5.11 is a brand known for innovation and authenticity, and works directly with end users to create purpose-built apparel and gear designed to enhance the safety, accuracy, speed and performance of tactical professionals and enthusiasts worldwide. 5.11 operates sales offices and distribution centers globally, and 5.11 products are widely distributed in uniform stores, military exchanges, outdoor retail stores, its own retail stores and on 511tactical.com.\nResults of Operations\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>347,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>309,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>191,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>147,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>124,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,121\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2018\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $388.6 million, an increase of $40.7 million, or 11.7%, compared to the same period in 2018. This increase is due primarily to retail and e-commerce sales growth of $39.3 million or 44%, driven by growing demand in direct to consumer channels. Retail sales grew largely due to sixteen new retail store openings since December 2018 (bringing the total store count to sixty-one as of December 31, 2019). The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were further increased by strong sales growth at Beyond of $7.5 million or 52%. Through the Beyond product category, 5.11 offers technical survival outerwear systems engineered for missions in extreme conditions. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year was offset by an $2.7 million decrease in consumer wholesale and a $1.4 million decrease in professional sales.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018 to 49.3% in the year ended December 31, 2019. The prior year cost of sales included a higher level of chargebacks incurred and discretionary discounts granted to customers while working through the backlog associated with challenges experienced while implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was positively impacted by channel mix as direct to consumer sales, which realize higher gross profit than wholesale revenues, grew significantly versus the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased to $159.4 million or 41.0% of net sales compared to $147.1 million or 42.3% of net sales in the same period in 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the higher level of expense in the prior year associated with the move into 5.11's new Manteca warehouse facility. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was further impacted by leveraging and controlling travel expenses during fiscal year 2019. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in marketing spend to drive demand in the growing direct to consumer channels as well as performance based bonuses in fiscal year 2019.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $22.4 million, an increase of $18.5 million when compared to the same period in 2018, based on the factors described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $347.9 million, an increase of $37.9 million, or 12.2%, compared to the same period in 2017. This increase is due primarily to retail and e-commerce sales growth of $25.4 million or 51%, driven by growing demand in direct to consumer channels. Retail sales grew largely due to eighteen new retail store openings since December 2017 (bringing the total store count to forty-five as of December 31, 2018). The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was offset by a $17.6 million decline in Direct-to-Agency sales. Direct-to-agency sales represent large contracts consisting primarily of SMU (special make-up) custom uniform product designed for large law enforcement divisions. The Direct-to-agency contract process is driven primarily by lengthy governmental approval processes and can take upwards of 18 to 36 months, therefore revenue streams are not consistent year-over-year.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.2% in the year ended December 31, 2017 to 46.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $21.7 million in expense related to a $39.1 million inventory step-up resulting from the acquisition purchase price allocation. The total inventory step-up amount of $39.1 million was expensed to cost of goods sold over the expected turns of 5.11's inventory. Excluding the effect of the expense associated with the inventory step-up in 2017, gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 48.2%. The decrease in gross profit percentage in the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to a higher level of chargebacks incurred and discretionary discounts granted to customers while working through the backlog associated with challenges experienced while implementing a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to $147.1 million or 42.3% of net sales compared to $125.0 million or 40.3% of net sales in the same period in 2017. This increase in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to eighteen new retail stores that were not open in the prior comparable period, higher temporary labor costs associated with the ERP implementation, higher software maintenance costs related to the ERP system and costs to move into 5.11's new Manteca warehouse facility, which occurred in the second quarter of 2018.\nIncome (loss) from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.9 million, an increase of $11.0 million when compared to the same period in 2017, primarily due to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation and the increase in selling, general and administrative expense as noted above.\nErgobaby\nOverview\nErgobaby, headquartered in Los Angeles, California, is a designer, marketer and distributor of wearable baby carriers and accessories, blankets and swaddlers, nursing pillows, strollers, and related products. Ergobaby primarily sells its Ergobaby and Baby Tula branded products through brick-and-mortar retailers, national chain stores, online retailers, its own websites and distributors and derives more than half of its sales from outside of the United States.\nResults of Operations\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>59,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68,945\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2018\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $90.0 million, a decrease of $0.6 million or 0.6% compared to the same period in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2019, international sales were approximately $62.0 million, representing an increase of $4.0 million over the corresponding period in 2018. Domestic sales were $28.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting a decrease of $4.6 million compared to the corresponding period in 2018. The decrease in domestic sales was primarily the result of declines in both the Ergobaby and Tula brands.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 65.9% for the same period in 2018. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was due to changes in product mix from higher margin channels to lower margin channels.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased to approximately $38.9 million or 43.2% of net sales compared to $40.2 million or 44.4% of net sales for the same period of 2018. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 is due to lower variable expenses related to sales, reduction in headcount, reduction in marketing spend and reduced travel in 2019. This was partially offset by additional legal fees incurred during 2019.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $1.1 million, to $10.4 million, compared to $11.5 million for the same period of 2018, primarily as a result of the factors described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $90.6 million, a decrease of $12.4 million or 12.0% compared to the same period in 2017. Net sales from Baby Tula for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $19.4 million, compared to $22.4 million in net sales in the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, international sales were approximately $58.0 million, representing a decrease of $4.6 million over the corresponding period in 2017. Baby Tula international sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $1.0 million from the corresponding period in 2017. Domestic sales were $32.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, reflecting a decrease of $7.8 million compared to the corresponding period in 2017. The decrease in domestic sales was primarily the result of the disruption in the retail landscape during 2018, including the continuing effect of the liquidation of a large U.S. retail customer.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 65.9% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 67.0% for the same period in 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to changes in product mix and increased production costs as a result of the launch of a new stroller product.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased to approximately $40.2 million or 44.4% of net sales compared to $33.4 million or 32.4% of net sales for the same period of 2017. Selling, general and administrative expense in the prior year included the reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to Ergobaby's acquisition of Baby Tula of $3.8 million. Eliminating the effect of the contingent consideration, the increase in Ergobaby's selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, additional marketing for the new stroller product category launch, additional expense related to the closure of a large retail account, higher distribution and fulfillment costs, commissions due to the mix of sales, as well as the impact of foreign exchange rates.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $13.0 million, to $11.5 million, compared to $24.5 million for the same period of 2017, primarily as a result of the factors described above.\nLiberty Safe\nOverview\nFounded in 1988 and based in Payson, Utah, Liberty Safe is the premier designer, manufacturer and marketer of home and gun safes in North America.

Non-Dealer sales were approximately $45.8 million in 2019 compared to $32.9 million in 2018, representing an increase of $12.8 million or 38.9%. The increase in Non-Dealer sales was primarily due to the addition of a new customer in the Farm and Fleet channel in the year ended December 31, 2019. Dealer sales totaled approximately $50.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $49.7 million in the same period in 2018, representing an increase of $0.6 million or 1.2%. Liberty Safe's sales backlog was approximately $5.7 million at December 31, 2019 compared to approximately $6.0 million at December 31, 2018.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled approximately 21.8% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is attributable primarily to increased raw material costs in the first half of the year as well as changes in freight costs for certain customers in fiscal year 2019 which has decreased margins for these customers.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased to approximately $12.0 million or 12.4% of net sales compared to $13.2 million or 15.9% of net sales for the same period of 2018. The $1.2 million decrease is primarily attributable to a planned reduction in advertising expense as Liberty refocused its ad spending from national radio and print advertising to digital media, and a reduction in co-op advertising allowances for certain national retailers.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations increased $2.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $8.5 million compared to income from operations of $5.9 million during the same period in 2018, principally as a result of the increase in sales and gross profit in 2019, as described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased approximately $9.3 million or 10.1%, to $82.7 million, compared to the corresponding period ended December 31, 2017. Non-Dealer sales were approximately $32.9 million in 2018 compared to $42.3 million in 2017, representing a decrease of $9.4 million or 22.2%. Dealer sales totaled approximately $49.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $49.5 million in the same period in 2017, representing an increase of $0.2 million or 0.4%. Liberty continues to face negative trends in the U.S. outdoor retail market, including the bankruptcy filing by a national retailer in the prior year, slower ordering and reductions of inventory levels as a result of the merger of two major outdoor retailers and softer sales at retailers dealing in sporting goods. Liberty Safe's sales backlog was approximately $6.0 million at December 31, 2018 compared to approximately $6.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales totaled approximately 23.8% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 27.9% in the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 is attributable primarily to cost increases in raw materials. Liberty has continued to see a rise in raw material costs, particularly the cost of steel, during 2018 as the tariffs on imported steel has led to rising domestic steel prices. On average, materials account for approximately 60% of the total costs of a safe, with steel accounting for 45% of material costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to approximately $13.2 million or 15.9% of net sales compared to $15.4 million or 16.7% of net sales for the same period of 2017. The $2.2 million decrease is primarily attributable to a nonrecurring $1.9 million reserve recorded in the first quarter of 2017 against the outstanding accounts receivable of a retail customer that filed for bankruptcy.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations decreased $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 to $5.9 million compared to income from operations of $9.5 million during the same period in 2017, principally as a result of the decrease in sales and gross profit in 2018, as described above.\nVelocity Outdoor\nOverview\nVelocity Outdoor is a leading designer, manufacturer, and marketer of airguns, archery products, laser aiming devices and related accessories.

The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to add-on acquisition of Ravin Crossbows in September 2018, partially offset by sales associated with the non-recurring Junior Reserves Officer Training Corps (JROTC) contract that shipped in the first half of 2018. Ravin had net sales of $43.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, representing a full year of ownership, compared to $12.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 27.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 26.2% in the year December 31, 2018. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $2.5 million in expense related to the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation for Ravin. Excluding the effect of the inventory step-up, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales in the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 3, 2018 was primarily due to mix within the archery product line as well as the gross margin impact from the 2018 of the JROTC contract.\nSelling general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $25.3 million, or 17.1% of net sales compared to $22.8 million, or 17.3% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $1.3 million in acquisition costs related to our acquisition of Ravin in September 2018 while fiscal year 2019 had higher expenses associated with the full year impact of the Ravin acquisition, as well as an increase in the fair value of the Ravin earn-out of $2.0 million that was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nImpairment expense\nAs a result of operating results below forecasts in the current period as well as a re-forecast of the Velocity business in which planned earnings and revenue fell below the forecasts of prior periods, Velocity performed an interim impairment test of their goodwill during the quarter ended September 30, 2019, which resulted in the recording of impairment expense of $32.9 million.\n(Loss) income from operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $27.1 million, a decrease of $32.0 million when compared to income from operations of $4.9 million for the comparable period in 2018, primarily as a result of the impairment expense recognized during the third quarter of 2019.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Pro Forma Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $131.3 million compared to net sales of $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $11.3 million or 9.4%. The increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to add-on acquisitions in the third quarters of 2017 and 2018.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 23.0% in the year December 31, 2017. Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $2.5 million in expense related to the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation for Ravin, while cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $3.3 million in expense related to the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation for Velocity. Excluding the effect of the inventory step-ups, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 28.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the mix of products sold during the two periods.\nSelling general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $22.8 million, or 17.3% of net sales compared to $18.6 million, or 15.5% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $1.3 million in acquisition costs related to our acquisition of Ravin in September 2018. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $1.8 million in transaction costs paid in relation to the acquisition of Velocity in June 2017 and an add-on acquisition at Velocity completed during the third quarter of 2017. The balance of the expense growth in 2018 is related to increased sales support, marketing spend and the impact from the 2017 and 2018 add-on acquisitions.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $4.9 million, an increase of $1.1 million when compared to income from operations of $3.8 million for the comparable period in 2017, based on the factors described above.\nNiche Industrial Businesses\nAdvanced Circuits\nOverview\nAdvanced Circuits is a provider of small-run, quick-turn and volume production (including assembly) PCBs to customers throughout the United States. Historically, small-run and quick-turn PCBs have represented approximately 50% to 54% of Advanced Circuits' gross revenues. Small-run and quick-turn PCBs typically command higher margins than volume production PCBs given that customers require high levels of responsiveness, technical support and timely delivery of small-run and quick-turn PCBs and are willing to pay a premium for them. Advanced Circuits is able to meet its customers' demands by manufacturing custom PCBs in as little as 24 hours, while maintaining over 98.0% error-free production rates and real-time customer service and product tracking 24 hours per day.\nResults of Operations\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,108\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,575\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2018\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $90.8 million compared to approximately $92.5 million for the same period in 2018, a decrease of approximately $1.7 million or 1.9%. The decrease in net sales was due primarily to a facility move at ACI's Arizona location that halted production for a portion of September 2019 and led to a decrease in sales in the third quarter of 2019. Net sales decreased in Quick-Turn Production by approximately $2.1 million, Quick-Turn Small-Run by approximately $0.9 million, Assembly by approximately $0.5 million, and Subcontract by $0.1 million during the year ending December 31, 2019 as compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by increases in Long-Lead Time/Other of approximately $0.3 million, and decreases in promotions of approximately $1.6 million.

The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense is primarily due to decreased commissions paid in fiscal year 2019 as a result of the decrease in sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses represented 16.3% of net sales for both the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $25.7 million compared to $26.3 million in the same period in 2018, a decrease of approximately $0.7 million, as a result of the factors described above.\nYear ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $92.5 million compared to approximately $87.8 million for the same period in 2017, an increase of approximately $4.7 million or 5.4%. The increase in net sales was due to increased sales in Quick-Turn Production PCBs by approximately $1.3 million, Long-Lead Time PCBs by approximately $2.4 million, Subcontract by approximately $1.0 million, and decreased Promotion by approximately $0.8 million. This was partially offset by decreases in Assembly sales by approximately $0.1 million and Quick-Turn Small-Run PCBs by approximately $0.7 million.

The historical results of Sterno for the period from January 1, 2018 through February 15, 2018 have been adjusted to reflect $0.1 million in depreciation expense, and $1.6 million in amortization expense.\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Pro Forma Year ended December 31, 2018\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $395.4 million, a decrease of $10.4 million or 2.6% compared to the pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net sales variance reflects a decrease in sales of outdoor lighting products at Sterno Home primarily as a result of inclement weather during the spring period in the domestic market and a higher level of rebates and chargebacks compared to the prior year, offset by an increase in sales volume at Rimports.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 24.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 25.8% for the same period ended December 31, 2019. Sterno recognized $4.6 million in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2018 and $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation of the Rimports acquisition. After eliminating the effect of the inventory step-up, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The gross profit percentage was relatively flat year over year, reflecting favorable pricing and chemical costs offset by higher metal costs, and start up costs related to new products at Rimports.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $39.7 million as compared to $37.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase of $2.6 million or 7.0%. The expense in the prior year reflects $0.6 million in acquisition expense related to Rimports and a reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Rimports of $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. After eliminating the effect of the acquisition expense and contingent consideration reversal related to Rimports, the decrease in selling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects lower commission, salaries and incentives at Rimports and Sterno Home. Selling, general and administrative expense represented 10.0% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 9.1% of net sales for the same period in 2018.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $44.8 million, an increase of $2.3 million when compared to the same period in 2018, based on the factors noted above.\nPro Forma Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Pro Forma Year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $405.9 million, an increase of $22.5 million or 5.9% compared to the same period in 2017. The net sales variance reflects increased Rimports sales relating to harvest promotions, scented wax products and essential oils, as well as stronger Sterno Home candle and outdoor sales.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from 25.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 24.0% for the same period ended December 31, 2018. Sterno recognized $4.6 million in cost of goods sold in the second quarter of 2018 and $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2018 related to the amortization of the inventory step-up resulting from the purchase price allocation of the Rimports acquisition. After eliminating the effect of the inventory step-up, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 25.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in gross profit percentage during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily reflects an increase in chemical and other material costs, as well as higher freight and carrier costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $37.1 million as compared to $37.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.8 million or 2.0%. Selling, general and administrative expense represented 9.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 9.9% of net sales for the same period in 2017. The decrease as a percentage of net sales in 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 reflects the reversal of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Rimports of $4.8 million, the increase in sales during the current period, and lower marketing costs, commissions, and development expense.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $42.5 million, a decrease of $1.3 million when compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to the increased costs associated with the Rimports acquisition, including the inventory step-up expense noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our cash activity for the years presented:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84,562\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>743,126\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(604,080\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(779,522\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>500,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,588\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>(1,178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,792\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $84.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represents a decrease of $29.9 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of $114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cash provide by operating activities is primarily due to the effect of cash flows from discontinued operations and reflects the timing of the sale of Manitoba Harvest and Clean Earth in fiscal year 2019. Cash used in operating activities of discontinued operations in the current year was $10.1 million while cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $42.6 million in year ended December 31, 2018. Fiscal year 2018 reflects a full year of operations of our discontinued operations while the current year reflects the effect of the sales of Manitoba Harvest in February 2019 and Clean Earth in June 2019. Cash used in operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $15.2 million as compared to cash used for working capital of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in cash used for working capital purposes in the current year primarily reflects the effect of our acquisitions that occurred in February 2018 which resulted in an increase in cash needed to fund working capital, particularly at Rimports.\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represented an increase of $32.7 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash used in operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $7.7 million as compared to cash used for working capital of $37.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our working capital cash flows in the year ended December 31, 2018 reflect a significant decrease in the cash flows from accounts receivable as well as a significant decrease in cash flow paid for accounts payable and accrued expenses compared to the prior year, resulting in an overall decrease in the cash used for working capital. This decrease mostly reflects timing of collections and payments in 2018.\nCash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately $81.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a decrease of $29.6 million compared to cash flow from operating activities of $111.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to cash used for inventory at our consumer businesses during 2017, as well as a full year of operations at 5.11 (acquired in August 2016) and the acquisition of Velocity Outdoor in June 2017. Cash used in operating activities for working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $37.3 million.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash flows provided by investing activities totaled approximately $743.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $604.1 million used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flows from Clean Earth and Manitoba Harvest, which are reflected as discontinued operations, totaled $279.2 million in fiscal year 2019 and reflects the effect of the sale transactions. Cash provided by investing activities in the current year primarily relates to the proceeds received from the sales of Clean Earth and Manitoba. In the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a platform acquisition in the first quarter, Foam Fabricators, and several add-on acquisitions at our subsidiaries. Sterno acquired Rimports in February 2018, and our Velocity Outdoor subsidiary acquired Ravin in\nSeptember 2018. The total cash paid for these acquisitions during 2018 was $495.1 million. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $6.1 million, due primarily to expenditures at our 5.11 business related to investments in various infrastructure and systems projects in 2018 that were nonrecurring in 2019. We expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2020 to be approximately $30 million to $40 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled approximately $604.1 million, compared to $77.3 million used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $526.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had a platform acquisition in the first quarter, Foam Fabricators, and several add-on acquisitions at our subsidiaries. Sterno acquired Rimports in February 2018, and our Velocity Outdoor subsidiary acquired Ravin in September 2018. The total cash paid for these acquisitions during 2018 was $495.1 million, while in the year ended December 31, 2017, we spent approximately $158.7 million related to our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and an add-on acquisition at our Clean Earth subsidiary, which was sold in 2019. The cash flows from Clean Earth are included in cash flows from investing activities - discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $2.5 million, due primarily to expenditures at our 5.11 business related to investments in various infrastructure and systems projects to position them for future growth.\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately $77.3 million, compared to $363.0 million used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $285.7 million. During 2016, we completed our acquisition of 5.11 in August, and several add-on acquisitions including the acquisition of Baby Tula by Ergobaby and Sterno Home by Sterno for a total of $499.1 million in cash investment, while in 2017, our total cash paid for acquisitions of $158.7 million related to our acquisition of Velocity Outdoor and a smaller add-on acquisition. Capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $23.3 million, due primarily to expenditures at our 5.11 business related to investments in various infrastructure and systems projects. The cash paid for acquisitions and capital expenditures was offset in both years by proceeds from the sale of our investment in FOX, $136.1 million in 2017 and $182.5 million in 2016, as well as the sale of our Tridien business in 2016. The sale of our FOX shares in 2017 represented our remaining investment in FOX.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash flows used by financing activities totaled approximately $779.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $500.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. During 2019, we used the proceeds from our sales of Manitoba Harvest and Clean Earth as well as the proceeds from our Series C Preferred Share offering to repay $832.3 million of the outstanding amount under our 2018 Credit Facility, which represented all of the amount outstanding under our 2018 Term Loan, as well as the outstanding amounts under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. In additional to the payment of our common and preferred share distributions, we also made a distribution during 2019 to our Allocation Interest holders of $60.4 million related to the sales of Manitoba Harvest and Clean Earth.\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled approximately $500.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our financing cash flows in 2018 primarily related to the financing of our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018, which were financed through draws on our 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by net proceeds of $96.5 million from the Series B Preferred Shares offering in March 2018 which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding amount on the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. In April 2018, we issued $400 million in Senior Notes and amended our credit facility. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes were used to pay down outstanding amounts under our credit facility. Concurrently with the issuance of our Senior Notes, we refinanced our 2014 Credit Facility and reduced the amount outstanding on our term loan from $558.6 million to $500 million. In addition to activity on our credit facility, financing activities reflect the payment of our quarterly common share distributions ($86.3 million in 2018 and 2017) and preferred share distributions ($12.2 million in 2018 and $2.5 million in 2017).\nCash flows used in financing activities totaled approximately $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $208.7 million. Our financing cash flows in 2017 principally reflect the following:\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The payments of our shareholder distributions of $86.3 million related to our common shares and $2.5 million related to our Series A Preferred Shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Distributions of $39.2 million paid during 2017 to Holders of the allocation interest related to the sale of our FOX shares;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Proceeds of $96.4 million from a preferred stock offering completed in June 2017; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net borrowings during the year of $31.9 million under our 2014 Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> The decrease in cash flows from financing activities in 2017 as compared to 2016 is primarily due to the borrowings in the prior year related to the amendment of our credit facility, including borrowings under our 2016 Incremental Term Loan of $250 million, which was used to fund the acquisition of 5.11.\nTotal Liabilities and Intercompany loans to our businesses\nThe following table summarizes the total liabilities and intercompany debt of our business as of December 31, 2019: Table 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Intercompany Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Liabilities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>292,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ergobaby\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liberty\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Velocity Outdoor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>148,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Circuits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62,604\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arnold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,214\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foam Fabricators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sterno\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>303,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>850,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,174,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and eliminations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(850,904\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(448,176\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>726,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEach loan has a scheduled maturity and each business is entitled to repay all or a portion of the principal amount of the outstanding loans, without penalty, prior to maturity. A component of our acquisition financing strategy that we utilize in acquiring the businesses we own and manage is to provide both equity capital and debt capital, raised at the parent level through our existing credit facility. Our strategy of providing intercompany debt financing within the capital structure of the businesses that we acquire and manage allows us the ability to distribute cash to the parent company through monthly interest payments and amortization of the principle on these intercompany loans. Each loan to our businesses has a scheduled maturity and each business is entitled to repay all or a portion of the principal amount of the outstanding loans, without penalty, prior to maturity. Certain of our businesses have paid down their respective intercompany debt balances through the cash flow generated by these businesses and we have recapitalized, and expect to continue to recapitalize, these businesses in the normal course of our business. The recapitalization process involves funding the intercompany debt using either cash on hand at the parent or our revolving credit facility, and serves the purpose of optimizing the capital structure at our subsidiaries and providing the noncontrolling shareholders with a distribution on their ownership interest in a cash flow positive business.\nIn January 2018, the Company completed a recapitalization at Sterno whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Sterno (the \"Sterno Loan Agreement\"). The Sterno Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of $56.8 million to fund a distribution to the Company, which owned 100% of the outstanding equity of Sterno at the time of the recapitalization, and (ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans. In connection with the recapitalization, Sterno's management team exercised all of their vested stock options, which represented 58,000 shares of Sterno. The Company then used a portion of the distribution to repurchase the 58,000 shares from management for a total purchase price of $6.0 million. In addition, Sterno issued new stock options to replace the exercised options, thus maintaining the same percentage of fully diluted non-controlling interest that existed prior to the recapitalization. In February 2018, Sterno completed the acquisition of Rimports (refer\nto \"Note D - Acquisition of Businesses\" for a description of the transaction) for a purchase price of approximately $145 million. Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition of Rimports, we amended the Sterno Loan Agreement to provide for the advance of additional term loans in the aggregate amount of $136 million, and revolving loans in the amount of $10 million.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we amended the 5.11 intercompany credit agreement to update the definition of capital expenditures to exclude capital expenditures made with respect to 5.11's retail stores from the calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio. Liberty was not in compliance with the financial covenants under their intercompany loan agreement at December 31, 2018, and we amended the Liberty intercompany credit agreement to grant a waiver to them through the quarter ended December 31, 2019. All of our subsidiaries were in compliance with the financial covenants included within their intercompany credit arrangements at December 31, 2019.\nOur primary source of cash is from the receipt of interest and principal on our outstanding loans to our businesses. Accordingly, we are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow of these businesses, which are available for (i) operating expenses; (ii) payment of principal and interest under our 2018 Credit Facility; (iii) payments to CGM due or potentially due pursuant to the revised MSA and the LLC Agreement; (iv) cash distributions to our shareholders; and (v) investments in future acquisitions. Payments made under (i) through (iii) above are required to be paid before distributions to shareholders and may be significant and exceed the funds held by us, which may require us to dispose of assets or incur debt to fund such expenditures.\nWe believe that we currently have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our existing obligations, including quarterly distributions to our shareholders, as approved by our board of directors, over the next twelve months.\nFinancing Arrangements\n2018 Credit Facility\nIn April 2018, we entered into the 2018 Credit Facility to amend and restate the 2014 Credit Facility, originally dated as of June 6, 2014. The 2018 Credit Facility provides for (i) revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit up to a maximum aggregate amount of $600 million, and (ii) a $500 million term loan. All amounts outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility will become due on April 18, 2023, which is the maturity date of loans advanced under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the termination date of the revolving loan commitment. The 2018 Credit Facility also permits us, prior to the applicable maturity date, to increase the revolving loan commitment and/or obtain additional term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $250 million subject to certain restrictions and conditions.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $193.8 million of the 2018 Term Loan in July 2019, and the remaining $298.8 million due under the 2018 Term loan in November 2019.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility provides for letters of credit under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate face amount not to exceed $100 million outstanding at any time, as well as swing line loans of up to $25 million outstanding at one time. At no time may the (i) aggregate principal amount of all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of all outstanding letters of credit and swing line loans, exceed the borrowing availability under the 2018 Credit Facility.\nThe 2018 Credit Facility is secured by all of the assets of the Company, including all of its equity interests in, and loans to, its consolidated subsidiaries. At December 31, 2019, we had letters of credit totaling $3.6 million outstanding under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. We had approximately $596.4 million in borrowing base availability under this facility at December 31, 2019. (See \"Note I - Debt\" to the consolidated financial statements for more detail regarding our 2018 Credit Facility).\n2014 Credit Facility\nThe 2014 Credit Facility, as amended, provided for (i) a revolving credit facility of $550 million, (ii) a $325 million term loan (the \"2014 Term Loan\"), and (iii) a $250 million incremental term loan. The 2018 Credit Facility amended and restated the 2014 Credit Facility.\nSenior Notes\nOn April 18, 2018, we consummated the issuance and sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes offered pursuant to a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and to non-U.S. persons under Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to repay debt under our existing credit facilities in connection with a concurrent refinancing\ntransaction described above. The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of April 18, 2018 (the Indenture\u201d), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.000% per annum and will mature on May 1, 2026. Interest on the Notes is payable in cash on May 1st and November 1st of each year, beginning on November 1, 2018.

The agreement required us to pay interest on the notional amount at the rate of 2.97% in exchange for the three-month LIBOR rate. In connection with the repayment of the 2018 Term Loan in\nDecember 2019, the Company terminated the Swap with a payment of $4.9 million, the fair value of the Swap as of the date of settlement.\nIncome Taxes\nCompass Diversified Holdings and Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC are classified as partnerships for U.S. Federal income tax purposes and are not subject to income taxes. Each of the Company's majority owned subsidiaries are subject to Federal, state and in some cases, foreign income taxes. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Tax Act also subjects the Company to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe recorded an income tax provision of $14.7 million with an annual effective rate of 56.6% during the year ended December 31, 2019, an income tax provision of $10.5 million with an annual effective tax rate of 124.4% during the year ended December 31, 2018, and $23.7 million in income tax benefit with an effective tax rate of 246.5% during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our gains and losses incurred at the Company's parent, which is an LLC, are not tax deductible at the corporate level as those costs are passed through to the shareholders.\nThe components of our income tax (benefit) expense as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are as follows:\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States Federal Statutory Rate\n</td> <td>(21.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes (net of Federal benefits)\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign income taxes\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses of Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC\nrepresenting a pass through to shareholders (1)\n</td> <td>39.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment expense\n</td> <td>21.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of gain on investment in FOX\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of subsidiary employee stock options\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic production activities deduction\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-deductible acquisition costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of undistributed foreign earnings\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-recognition of various carryforwards at subsidiaries\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to uncertain tax positions (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Utilization of tax credits\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Tax Act - GILTI tax\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Tax Act - remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(211.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of Tax Act - transition tax on non-U.S. subsidiaries' earnings (3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective income tax rate\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(246.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The effective income tax rate for each of the years presented includes losses at the Company's parent, which is taxed as a partnership.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 226: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents the effect of the reversal of an uncertain tax position at our 5.11 business that existed as of the acquisition date and was settled during the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a tax benefit of $9.2 million in our 2017 tax provision.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 227: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>The effect of the enactment of the Tax Act on our tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a benefit of $34.7 million related to the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, and tax expense of $4.9 million related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future performance, financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our financial statements, and vice versa for measures that include amounts, or are subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure as calculated and presented. GAAP or US GAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. These measures are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP, and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Flow Available for Distribution and Reinvestment ( CAD\u201d).\nReconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA - Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) is calculated as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation expense and amortization expense. Amortization expenses consist of amortization of intangibles and debt charges, including debt issuance costs, discounts, etc.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Is calculated utilizing the same calculation as described above in arriving at EBITDA further adjusted by: (i) non-controlling shareholder compensation, which generally consists of non-cash stock option expense; (ii) successful acquisition costs, which consist of transaction costs (legal, accounting, due diligences, etc.) incurred in connection with the successful acquisition of a business expensed during the period in compliance with ASC 805; (iii) management fees, which reflect fees due quarterly to our Manager in connection with our MSA; (iv) impairment charges, which reflect write downs to goodwill or other intangible assets; (v) gains or losses recorded in connection with changes in the fair value of our investment in FOX; (vi) other income or expense, including gains or losses recorded in connection with the sale of fixed assets; (vii) changes in the fair value of contingent consideration subsequent to initial purchase accounting; (viii) integration service fees, which reflect fees paid by newly acquired companies to the Manager for integration services performed during the first year of ownership and (viii) gains or losses recognized upon the sale of a business.\nWe believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and reflect important financial measures as they exclude the effects of items which reflect the impact of long-term investment decisions, rather than the performance of near term operations. When compared to net income (loss) these financial measures are limited in that they do not reflect the periodic costs of certain capital assets used in generating revenues of our businesses or the non-cash charges associated with impairments. This presentation also allows investors to view the performance of our businesses in a manner similar to the methods used by us and the management of our businesses, provides additional insight into our operating results and provides a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition.\nWe believe these measurements are also useful in measuring our ability to service debt and other payment obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not meant to be a substitute for GAAP, and may be different from or otherwise inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), which we consider to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

reflected on our income statement in order to provide an additional measure of management's estimate of cash available for distribution (\"CAD\"). CAD is a non-GAAP measure that we believe provides additional information to our shareholders in order to enable them to evaluate our ability to make anticipated quarterly distributions. Because other entities do not necessarily calculate CAD the same way we do, our presentation of CAD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures provided by other entities. We believe that our historic and future CAD, together with our cash balances and access to cash via our debt facilities, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated distributions over the next twelve months. The table below reconciles CAD to net income and to cash flow provided by operating activities, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The MSA provides for, among other things, CGM to perform services for us in exchange for a management fee paid quarterly and equal to 0.5% of our adjusted net assets. The management fee is required to be paid prior to the payment of any distributions to shareholders. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we incurred $37.0 million, $43.4 million, and $31.8 million, respectively, in management fees to CGM.\nPursuant to the MSA, CGM is entitled to enter into off-setting management service agreements with each of our segments. The amount of the fee is negotiated between CGM and the operating management of each segment and is based upon the value of the services to be provided. The fees paid directly to CGM by the segments offset on a dollar for dollar basis the amount due to CGM by the Company under the MSA. Concurrent with the June 2019 sale of Clean Earth (refer to Note C - Discontinued Operations), CGM agreed to waive the management fee on cash balances held at the Company, commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 and continuing until the quarter during which the Company next borrows under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2018, CGM waived $0.6 million in management fees attributable to the assets acquired in September related to the acquisition by Velocity Outdoor.\nLLC Agreement\nAs distinguished from its provision of providing management services to us, pursuant to the amended MSA, members of CGM are owners of 50.0% of the Allocation Interests in us through their ownership in Sostratus LLC. The LLC agreement gives the holders of Allocation Interests the right to distributions pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of a Sale Event or a Holding Event. The Allocation Interest Holders are entitled to receive and as such can elect to receive the positive contribution-based profit allocation payment for each of the business acquisitions during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (Holding Event) and upon the sale of the business (Sale Event). Holders received $60.4 million and $39.2 million in distributions related to Sale and Holding Events that occurred during 2019 and 2017, respectively. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a description of the profit allocation payments. There were no allocation payments made to the Allocation Interest Holders in 2018.\nCertain persons who are employees and partners of the Manager, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned (through Sostratus LLC) 50% of the Allocation Interests at December 31, 2019, and 49% of the Allocation Interests at December 31, 2018. Of the remaining 50% at December 31, 2019 and 51% at December 31, 2018, 5.0% was held by CGI Diversified Holdings LP, 5.0% was held by the Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, and the remaining Allocation Interests were held by the former founding partners of the Manager.\nIntegration Services Agreements\nIntegration services represent fees paid by newly acquired companies to the Manager for integration services performed during the first year of ownership. Foam Fabricators, which was acquired in 2018, Velocity Outdoor, which was acquired in 2017, and 5.11, which was acquired in 2016, each entered into an Integration Services Agreement (\"ISA\") with CGM. The ISA provides for CGM to provide services for new platform acquisitions to, amongst other things, assist the management at the acquired entities in establishing a corporate governance program, implement compliance and reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and align the acquired entity's policies and procedures with our other subsidiaries. Each ISA is for the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition and is payable quarterly. 5.11 paid CGM a total of $3.5 million under the ISA, with $2.3 million paid in 2017. Velocity Outdoor paid CGM a total of $1.5 million in integration services fees, with $0.75 million paid in 2018 and $0.75 million paid in 2017. Foam Fabricators paid CGM $2.3 million over the term of the ISA, ($2.0 million in integration service fees in 2018 and $0.3 million in 2019) During the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, CGM received $0.3 million, $2.7 million, and $3.1 million, respectively, in total integration service fees.\nCost Reimbursement and Fees\nWe reimbursed CGM approximately $5.6 million, $4.1 million, and $3.8 million, principally for occupancy and staffing costs incurred by CGM on our behalf during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nInvestment in FOX\nAs of July 10, 2014, our ownership interest in FOX decreased from 53% to approximately 41% after we sold shares in a secondary offering by FOX. Since we no longer held a majority interest in FOX, we began accounting for our investment in FOX at fair value utilizing the equity method of accounting. We elected to measure our investment in\nFOX using the fair value option fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as income (loss). In November 2016, our ownership interest in FOX decreased to approximately 14%. In March 2017, FOX closed on a secondary offering through which we sold our remaining 5,108,718 shares in FOX for total net proceeds of $136.1 million, after the underwriter's discount of $8.9 million. Subsequent to the sale of FOX shares in March 2017, we no longer hold an ownership interest in FOX.\nThe Company and its businesses have the following significant related party transactions:\n5.11\nRelated Party Vendor Purchases - 5.11 purchases inventory from a vendor who is a related party to 5.11 through one of the executive officers of 5.11 via the executive's 40% ownership interest in the vendor. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 5.11 purchased approximately $4.4 million, $5.0 million, and $5.6 million, respectively, in inventory from the vendor.\nLiberty\nRelated Party Vendor Purchases - Liberty purchases inventory raw materials from two vendors who are related parties to Liberty through two of the executive officers of Liberty via the employment of family members at the vendors. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Liberty purchased approximately $0.5 million, $2.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in raw materials from the two vendors.\nSterno\nRecapitalization - In January 2018, the Company completed a recapitalization at Sterno whereby the Company entered into an amendment to the intercompany loan agreement with Sterno (the \"Sterno Loan Agreement\"). The Sterno Loan Agreement was amended to (i) provide for term loan borrowings of $56.8 million to fund a distribution to the Company, which owned 100% of the outstanding equity of Sterno at the time of the recapitalization, and (ii) extend the maturity dates of the term loans. In connection with the recapitalization, Sterno's management team exercised all of their vested stock options, which represented 58,000 shares of Sterno. The Company then used a portion of the distribution to repurchase the 58,000 shares from management for a total purchase price of $6.0 million. In addition, Sterno issued new stock options to replace the exercised option, thus maintaining the same percentage of fully diluted non-controlling interest that existed prior to the recapitalization.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no special purpose entities or off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business.\nContractual Obligations\nLong-term contractual obligations, except for our long-term debt obligations, are generally not recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. Non-cancelable purchase obligations are obligations we incur during the normal course of business, based on projected needs.\nThe table below summarizes the payment schedule of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019:\nTable 244: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>592,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>432,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>134,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (3)\n</td> <td>812,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>235,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>287,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,539,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>293,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>378,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>470,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Reflects commitment fees and letter of credit fees under our Revolving Credit Facility and amounts due, together with interest on our Senior Notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Reflects various operating leases for office space, manufacturing facilities and equipment from third parties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 31, 2019, including: (i) shareholder distributions of $110.4 million; (ii) estimated management fees of $30.9 million per year over the next five years; and (iii) other obligations, including amounts\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ndue under employment agreements.

Such estimates and judgments may involve varying degrees of uncertainty. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and changes in other facts and circumstances, and potentially could result in materially different results. Our critical accounting estimates are discussed below. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including those policies discussed below, refer to \"Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard. The new standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard, and all related amendments, was effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and was adopted using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.\nThe adoption of the new revenue guidance represents a change in accounting principle that will more closely align revenue recognition with the transfer of control of our goods and services and will provide financial statement readers with enhanced disclosures. In accordance with the new revenue guidance, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services, and excludes any sales incentives or taxes collected from customers which are subsequently remitted to government authorities.\nThe Company's contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products to a customer. Determining whether the promises are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once the performance obligations are identified, the Company determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on a relative stand-alone selling price method. The corresponding revenues are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied as discussed above. Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and therefore observable.\nUpon adoption of the new revenue guidance, the Company's policy around estimating variable consideration related to sales incentives (early pay discounts, rights of return, rebates, chargebacks, and other discounts) included in certain customer contracts remained consistent with previous guidance. These incentives are recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Under the new guidance, variable consideration is estimated and included in total consideration at contract inception based on either the expected value method or the most likely outcome method. The method was applied consistently among each type of variable consideration and the Company applies the expected value method to estimate variable consideration. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and the Company's best judgment at the time and as a result, reflect applicable constraints. The Company includes in the transaction price an amount of variable consideration estimated in accordance with the new guidance only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accounting for business combinations requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in order to allocate the purchase price. The estimates of fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable using established valuation methods, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and other relevant information.\nThe determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by our management team and, when appropriate, valuations by independent third-party appraisers. We amortize intangible assets, such as trademarks and customer relationships, as well as property, plant and equipment, over their economic useful lives, unless those lives are indefinite. We consider factors such as historical information, our plans for the asset and similar assets held by our previously acquired portfolio companies. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess amount of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired. Our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of March 31st, and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. Each of our businesses represents a reporting unit.\nWe use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment testing. The qualitative factors we consider include, in part, the general macroeconomic environment, industry and market specific conditions for each reporting unit, financial performance including actual versus planned results and results of relevant prior periods, operating costs and cost impacts, as well as issues or events specific to the reporting unit. If qualitative factors are not sufficient to determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not to exceed its carrying value. we will perform a quantitative test the reporting unit whereby we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach or market approach, or a weighting of the two methods. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on Management's estimate of revenue growth rates and operating margins and take into consideration industry and market conditions as well as company specific economic factors. The discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the business and the uncertainty associated with the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable public companies with operating characteristics that are similar to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or available, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using only the income approach.\n2019 Interim Impairment Testing - As a result of operating results below forecasts in the current period as well as a re-forecast of the Velocity business in which planned earnings and revenue fell below the forecasts of prior periods, we determined that a triggering event had occurred at Velocity Outdoor in the third quarter of 2019 and performed an interim impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2019. The Company used an income approach for the impairment test, whereby we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimate of revenue growth rates and operating margins, and take into consideration industry and market conditions as well as company specific economic factors. The Company used a weighted average cost of capital of 12.2% in the income approach. The discount rate used was based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristics and Velocity's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Based on the results of the impairment test, the fair value of Velocity did not exceed the carrying value, indicating that the goodwill at Velocity is impaired. The difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Velocity business was $32.9 million, which the Company has recorded as impairment expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2019 Annual Impairment Testing - For our annual impairment testing at March 31, 2019, we determined that our Liberty operating segment required quantitative testing because we could not conclude that the fair value of Liberty significantly exceeded its carrying value based on qualitative factors alone. We concluded the goodwill impairment testing during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The results of the quantitative impairment testing of the Liberty reporting unit indicated that the fair value of the Liberty reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 135%. All of our other reporting units were tested qualitatively as of March 31, 2019, and the results of the qualitative analysis indicated that that it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeded their carrying value.\n2018 Annual Impairment Testing - Our Arnold operating segment previously had three separate reporting units. As a result of changes implemented by Arnold management during 2016 and 2017, we reassessed the reporting units at Arnold as of the annual impairment testing date in 2018. The separate Arnold reporting units were determined to only comprise one reporting unit at the Arnold operating segment level as of March 31, 2018. As part of the exercise of combining the separate Arnold reporting units into one reporting unit, we performed \"before\" and \"after\" goodwill impairment testing, whereby we performed the annual impairment testing for each of the existing reporting units of\nArnold and then subsequent to the completion of the annual impairment testing of the separate reporting units, we performed a quantitative impairment test of the Arnold operating segment. Two of the Arnold reporting units, PMAG and PTM, were tested qualitatively as part of the \"before\" test, while a quantitative impairment test was performed on the Flexmag reporting unit because we could not determine that it was more-likely than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. We then performed a quantitative impairment test of the Arnold operating segment, which combined the three reporting units. The results of the quantitative impairment testing of the Arnold reporting unit indicated that the fair value of the Arnold reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by 254%. All of our other reporting units were tested qualitatively as of March 31, 2018, and the results of the qualitative analysis indicated that the fair value exceeded their carrying value.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\nWe use a qualitative approach to test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names with a carrying value of approximately $60.0 million. The results of the qualitative analysis of our other reporting unit's indefinite-lived intangible assets, which we completed as of March 31, 2019, indicated that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying value.\nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, including customer relationships, non-compete agreements, permits and technology are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service. We evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value, the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized.\nThe determination of fair values and estimated useful lives requires significant judgment both by our management team and by outside experts engaged to assist in this process. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to our reporting units and intangible assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or the incurrence of an impairment charge.\nProfit Allocation Interests\nAt the time of our Initial Public Offering, we issued Allocation Interests governed by our LLC agreement that entitle the holders (the \"Holders\") to receive distributions pursuant to a profit allocation formula upon the occurrence of certain events. The Holders are entitled to receive and as such can elect to receive the positive contribution based profit allocation payment for each of the business acquisitions during the 30-day period following the fifth anniversary of the date upon which we acquired a controlling interest in that business (Holding Event) and upon the sale of that business (Sale Event).\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \"Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "This report discusses the forward-looking statements and risks associated with Compass Diversified Holdings, a company formed to acquire and manage small and middle-market businesses in North America.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Our actual results, performance, prospects or opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently deem immaterial could also cause our actual results to differ, including those discussed in the sections entitled Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nCompass Diversified Holdings, a Delaware statutory trust, was incorporated in Delaware on November 18, 2005. Compass Group Diversified Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company, was also formed on November 18, 2005. In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust is sole owner of 100% of the Trust Interests (as defined in the LLC Agreement) of the Company and, pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Company has outstanding, the identical number of Trust Interests as the number of outstanding shares of the Trust. Sostratus LLC owns all of our Allocation Interests. The Company is the operating entity with a board of directors and other corporate governance responsibilities, similar to that of a Delaware corporation.\nThe Trust and the Company were formed to acquire and manage a group of small and middle-market businesses headquartered in North America. We characterize small and middle market businesses as those that generate annual cash flows of up to $75 million. We focus on companies of this size because we believe that these companies are more able to achieve growth rates above those of their relevant industries and are also frequently more amenable to efforts to improve earnings and cash flow.\nIn pursuing new acquisitions, we seek businesses with the following characteristics:\n \u2022 North American base of operations; \n \u2022 stable and growing earnings and cash flow; \n \u2022 maintains a significant market share in defensible industry niche (i.e., has a reason to exist\u201d); \n \u2022 solid and proven management team with meaningful incentives; \n \u2022 low technological and/or product obsolescence risk; and \n \u2022 a diversified customer and supplier base.  Our management team's strategy for our subsidiaries involves:\n \u2022 utilizing structured incentive compensation programs tailored to each business in order to attract, recruit and retain talented managers to operate our businesses; \n \u2022 regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals; \n \u2022 assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic cash flow growth strategies (both revenue and cost related); \n \u2022 identifying and working with management to execute attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and \n \u2022 forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors, including independent directors, to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives.  Based on the experience of our management team and its ability to identify and negotiate acquisitions, we believe we are well- positioned to acquire additional attractive businesses. Our management team has a large network of approximately 2,000 deal intermediaries to whom it actively markets and who we expect to expose us to potential acquisitions. Through this network, as well as our management team's active proprietary transaction sourcing efforts, we typically have a substantial pipeline of potential acquisition targets. In consummating transactions, our management team has, in the past, been able to successfully navigate complex situations surrounding acquisitions, including corporate spin-offs, transitions of family-owned businesses, management buy-outs and reorganizations. We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with\na strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\nIn addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.\nInitial public offering and Company formation\nOn May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust at an offering price of $15.00 per share (the IPO\u201d). Subsequent to the IPO the Company's board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company.\nFrom May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2019, we purchased nineteen businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of ten businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAcquisitions\n\n(1) The total purchase price for CBS Holdings includes the acquisition of Staffmark Investment LLC in January 2008 for a purchase price of $128.6 million. The Company renamed its CBS Personnel business Staffmark subsequent to the acquisition.\n(2) Velocity Outdoor (formerly \"Crosman Corp.\") was purchased by the Company in May 2006 and subsequently sold in January 2007. We reacquired Velocity Outdoor in June 2017.\n(3) The total purchase price does not reflect add-on acquisitions made by our businesses subsequent to their purchase by CODI unless indicated.\n(4) FOX completed an IPO of its common stock in August 2013 in which we sold a 22% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership interest to 53%. In July 2014, FOX completed a secondary offering in which we sold a 12% interest in FOX, reducing our ownership\ninterest to 41% and resulting in the deconsolidation of FOX from our financial results. We subsequently sold our remaining shares of FOX and now hold no ownership interest in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sale of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million.\n(5) The total purchase price of Sterno includes the acquisition of Rimports in February 2018 for a purchase price of $154.4 million.\nDispositions\n\n(1) CODI portion of the net proceeds from disposition includes debt and equity proceeds and reflects the accounting for the redemption of the sold business's minority shareholders and transaction expenses.\n(2) Gain (loss) recognized on sale of our businesses is calculated by deducting our total invested capital from the net sale proceeds received.\n(3) Sale price of Manitoba Harvest was C$370 million. Translation to USD is as of the date of sale.\n* We made loans to and purchased a controlling interest in FOX on January 4, 2008, for approximately $80.4 million. In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of $61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of $428.7 million.\nWe are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and distributions of our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and distributions, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to:\n \u2022 meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges; \n \u2022 fund distributions from the businesses to the Company; and \n \u2022 be distributed by the Trust to shareholders. \n2019 Highlights and Recent Events\nRepayment of 2018 Term Loan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $193.8 million of the 2018 Term Loan in July 2019, and the remaining $298.8 million balance due under the 2018 Term loan in November 2019. In connection with the repayment, we recorded $8.9 million in expense associated with the deferred financing costs that we had previously capitalized associated with the 2018 Term Loan, and $3.4 million in expense associated with the original issue discount on the 2018 Term Loan. We had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $220 million that was effective April 1, 2016 through June 6, 2021, the original termination date of our 2014 Term Loan. We terminated the interest rate swap in connection with the repayment of the 2018 Term Loan, resulting in a payment of $4.9 million.\nTrust Preferred Share Issuance\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Trust issued 4,600,000 7.875% Series C Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $115.0 million, or $111.0 million net of underwriters' discount and issuance costs. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears, when and as declared by the Company's board of directors on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, beginning on January 30, 2020. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Shares are cumulative.\nSale of Clean Earth\nOn May 8, 2019, the Company, as majority stockholder of CEHI Acquisition Corporation (\"Clean Earth\" or CEHI\u201d) and as Sellers' Representative, entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Calrissian Holdings, LLC ( Buyer\u201d), CEHI, the other holders of stock and options of CEHI and, as Buyer's guarantor, Harsco Corporation, pursuant to which Buyer would acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of CEHI, the parent company of the operating entity, Clean Earth, Inc.\nOn June 28, 2019, Buyer completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding securities of CEHI pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The sale price for Clean Earth was based on an aggregate total enterprise value of $625 million and is subject to customary working capital adjustments. After the allocation of the sale proceeds to Clean Earth non-controlling equity holders and the payment of transaction expenses of approximately $10.7 million, we received approximately $552 million of total proceeds at closing related to our debt and equity interests in Clean Earth. We recognized a gain on the sale of Clean Earth of $209.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a discussion of the profit allocation associated with the sale of Clean Earth.\nSale of Manitoba Harvest\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Tilray, Inc. (\"Tilray\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, 1197879 B.C. Ltd. ( Tilray Subco\u201d), to sell to Tilray, through Tilray Subco, all of the issued and outstanding securities of our majority owned subsidiary, Manitoba Harvest for total consideration of up to C$419 million. The completion of the sale of Manitoba Harvest was subject to approval by the British Columbia Supreme Court, which occurred on February 21, 2019. The sale closed on February 28, 2019. Subject to certain customary adjustments, the shareholders of Manitoba Harvest, including the Company, received the following from Tilray as consideration for their shares of Manitoba Harvest: (i) C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of Manitoba Harvest and the holders of common shares of Manitoba Harvest ( Common Holders\u201d) and C$127.5 million in shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray ( Tilray Common Stock\u201d) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the sale (the Closing Date Consideration\u201d), and (ii) C$50 million in cash and C$42.5 million in Tilray Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that was six months after the closing date of the arrangement (the Deferred Consideration\u201d). The sale consideration also included a potential earnout of up to C$49 million in Tilray Common Stock to the Common Holders, if Manitoba Harvest achieved certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols prior to December 31, 2019. The threshold for the earnout was not achieved and no additional amount was recorded related to sale of Manitoba Harvest at December 31, 2019.\nThe cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration was reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness (including accrued interest) of Manitoba Harvest on the closing date of C$71.3 million ($53.7 million) and transaction expenses of approximately C$5.0 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of Manitoba Harvest of $121.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a discussion of the profit allocation associated with the sale of Manitoba Harvest. Our share of the net proceeds after accounting for the redemption of the noncontrolling shareholders and the payment of net indebtedness of Manitoba Harvest and transaction expenses was approximately $124.2 million in cash proceeds and in Tilray Common Stock. In August 2019, the Company received the Deferred\nConsideration related to the sale. The Company's portion of the Deferred Consideration totaled $28.4 million in cash proceeds and $19.6 million in Tilray Common Stock.\nThe Tilray Common Stock consideration was issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, such that any shares of Tilray Common Stock received by the Common Holders were freely tradeable. We sold the Tilray Common Stock received as part of the Closing Consideration during March 2019, recognizing a net loss of $5.3 million in Other income (expense) during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. In August 2019, the Company sold the Tilray Common Stock received as part of the Deferred Consideration, recognizing a loss of $4.9 million in Other income/ (expense) during the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n2019 Distributions\nCommon shares - For the 2019 fiscal year we declared distributions to our common shareholders totaling $1.44 per share.\nPreferred shares - For the 2019 fiscal year we declared distributions to our preferred shareholders totaling $1.8125 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares and $1.96875 on our Series B Preferred Shares. We also declared a distribution to our preferred shareholders of $0.38281 per share on our Series C Preferred Shares. The distribution on the Series C Preferred Shares covers the period from, and including, November 20, 2019, the original issue date of the Series C Preferred Shares, up to, but excluding, January 30, 2020.\n2020 Outlook and Significant Trends\nDuring 2019, the middle market continued to be an active segment for deal flow, with continued strong deal flow expected in 2020. High valuation levels continue to be driven by the availability of debt capital with favorable terms and financial and strategic buyers seeking to deploy available equity capital. We believe that companies will focus on expanding their customer bases by diversifying their products and services in existing geographic areas during 2020.\nWe remain focused on marketing the Company's attractive ownership and management attributes to potential sellers of middle market businesses and intermediaries. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for add-on acquisitions by certain of our existing subsidiary companies, which can be particularly attractive from a strategic perspective.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2020, we anticipate our niche industrial companies, combined as a whole, will continue to grow revenue and earnings as a result of the overall health of the economy. Our branded consumer companies, combined as a whole, may be impacted in 2019 by the continued weakening in the U.S. retail landscape, specifically, lower consumer foot traffic in brick and mortar retail, and the related shift to more online shopping. We believe our branded consumer companies, with their strong positions in their respective markets and powerful brands, remain well positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019, notwithstanding this difficult landscape.\nThe areas of focus for 2020, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include:\n \u2022 Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution and international expansion; \n \u2022 Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors; \n \u2022 Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities; \n \u2022 Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume; \n \u2022 Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and \n \u2022 Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations of our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and components of the results of operations as well as those components presented as a percent of net revenues, for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis.\nWe acquired Foam Fabricators in February 2018, Velocity Outdoor in June 2017, and our Sterno business acquired Rimports in February 2018. In the following results of operations, we provide (i) our actual Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which includes the historical results of operations of each of our businesses (operating segments) from the date of acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\" or \"US GAAP\") and (ii) comparative historical components of the results of operations for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis ( Results of Operations - Our Businesses\u201d), for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, where all years presented include relevant pro-forma adjustments for pre-acquisition periods and explanations where applicable. For the 2018 acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2017. The historical operating results of Rimports have been added to the previously reported Sterno results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Sterno results of operations for the 2018 period prior to acquisition by Sterno. For the 2017 acquisition of Velocity Outdoor, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased this business on January 1, 2017. We believe this presentation enhances the discussion and provides a more meaningful comparison of operating results. The following operating results of our businesses are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, going forward.\nAll dollar amounts in the financial tables are presented in thousands. References in the financial tables to percentage changes that are not meaningful are denoted by \"NM.\"\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Compass Diversified Holdings\n\nYear ended December 31, 2019 compared to the Year ended December 31, 2018\nNet revenues\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by approximately $92.9 million or 6.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $11.6 million and $33.1 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at 5.11 ($40.7 million), Liberty ($13.5 million) and Velocity ($16.5 million increase as a result of the Ravin acquisition in September 2018). These increases in\nrevenue were partially offset by a decrease in net sales at our Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($16.8 million decrease) in 2019 as compared to 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $43.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $6.9 million and $20.8 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2018. We also saw notable increases in cost of sales at 5.11 ($9.9 million), Liberty ($12.1 million) and Velocity ($10.3 million) corresponding to the increase in net sales noted above. This was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales at our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports of $16.3 million.\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 35.8% in year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 34.6% in 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $15.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $14.3 million in 2018 to $14.9 million in 2019, primarily due to transaction costs associated with an unsuccessful acquisition.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $37.0 million in expense for these fees compared to $43.4 million for the corresponding period in 2018. The $6.4 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2019 is principally due to the sales of Manitoba Harvest in the first quarter of 2019 and Clean earth in the second quarter of 2019. Concurrent with the June 2019 sale of Clean Earth, CGM agree to waive the management fee on cash balances held at the Company, commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 and continuing until the quarter in which the Company next borrows under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $4.5 million to $54.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018, and Ravin in September 2018.\nImpairment expense\nVelocity Outdoor performed an interim impairment test of their goodwill during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 as a result of operating results below forecasts in the current period as well as a re-forecast of the Velocity business in which planned earnings and revenue fell below the forecasts of prior periods. The impairment test resulted in Velocity Outdoor recording impairment expense of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded interest expense totaling $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $55.2 million for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of $3.0 million. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects the interest associated with the issuance of our Senior Notes in April 2018. We recorded $32.0 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $22.5 million in interest expense for the period from the date of issuance through December 31, 2018 related to the Senior Notes. This increase in interest expense as a result of the full", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

We believe the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions provides us with\na strategic advantage by allowing us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\nIn addition, because we intend to fund acquisitions through the utilization of our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, we do not expect to be subject to delays in or conditions by closing acquisitions that would be typically associated with transaction specific financing, as is typically the case in such acquisitions. We believe this advantage is a powerful one and is highly unusual in the marketplace for acquisitions in which we operate.\nInitial public offering and Company formation\nOn May 16, 2006, we completed our initial public offering of 13,500,000 shares of the Trust at an offering price of $15.00 per share (the IPO\u201d). Subsequent to the IPO the Company's board of directors engaged our Manager to externally manage the day-to-day operations and affairs of the Company, oversee the management and operations of the businesses and to perform those services customarily performed by executive officers of a public company.\nFrom May 16, 2006 through December 31, 2019, we purchased nineteen businesses (each of our businesses is treated as a separate operating segment) and disposed of ten businesses. The tables below reflect summarized information relating to our acquisitions and dispositions from the date of our IPO through December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nAcquisitions\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ownership Interest - December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Acquisition Date\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CODI Purchase Price\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Diluted\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBS Holdings (Staffmark) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Crosman (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>72,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advanced Circuits (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>81,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Silvue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>May 16, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tridien (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 1, 2006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aeroglide\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Halo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>American Furniture\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 4, 2008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liberty Safe (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 31, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ergobaby (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>September 16, 2010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CamelBak\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 24, 2011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Arnold Magnetics\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>March 5, 2012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clean Earth (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 7, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sterno (3) (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>October 10, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>314,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.5%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manitoba Harvest (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>July 10, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>August 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.58%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Velocity Outdoor (2) (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>June 2, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>93.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foam Fabricators\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 15, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>253,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The total purchase price for CBS Holdings includes the acquisition of Staffmark Investment LLC in January 2008 for a purchase price of $128.6 million.

Translation to USD is as of the date of sale.\n* We made loans to and purchased a controlling interest in FOX on January 4, 2008, for approximately $80.4 million. In August 2013, FOX completed an initial public offering of its common stock. As a result of the initial public offering, our ownership interest in FOX was reduced to approximately 53.9%. No gain was reflected as a result of the sale of our FOX shares in the initial public offering because our majority classification of FOX did not change. FOX used a portion of their net proceeds received from the sale of their shares as well as proceeds from a new external FOX credit facility to repay $61.5 million in outstanding indebtedness to us under their existing credit facility with us. In July 2014, through a secondary offering, our ownership in FOX was lowered from approximately 53% to approximately 41%, and as a result we deconsolidated FOX as of July 10, 2014. In March and August 2016, through two more secondary offerings and a share repurchase by FOX, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 23% as of September 30, 2016. In November 2016, through another secondary offering, our ownership in the outstanding common stock of FOX was further lowered to approximately 14%. On March 13, 2017, FOX closed on a secondary public offering of 5,108,718 shares of FOX common stock held by CODI, which represented CODI's remaining investment in FOX. We recognized total net proceeds from the sales of our FOX shares of approximately $465.1 million, plus proceeds from the repayment of the FOX credit facility of $61.5 million upon completion of their initial public offering, and a total gain of $428.7 million.\nWe are dependent on the earnings of, and cash receipts from, the businesses that we own in order to meet our corporate overhead and management fee expenses and to pay distributions. The earnings and distributions of our businesses are generally lowest in the first quarter, and strongest in the third and fourth quarter, of each fiscal year. These earnings and distributions, net of any non-controlling interest in these businesses, are available to:\n \u2022 meet capital expenditure requirements, management fees and corporate overhead charges; \n \u2022 fund distributions from the businesses to the Company; and \n \u2022 be distributed by the Trust to shareholders. \n2019 Highlights and Recent Events\nRepayment of 2018 Term Loan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid $193.8 million of the 2018 Term Loan in July 2019, and the remaining $298.8 million balance due under the 2018 Term loan in November 2019. In connection with the repayment, we recorded $8.9 million in expense associated with the deferred financing costs that we had previously capitalized associated with the 2018 Term Loan, and $3.4 million in expense associated with the original issue discount on the 2018 Term Loan. We had an interest rate swap with a notional amount of $220 million that was effective April 1, 2016 through June 6, 2021, the original termination date of our 2014 Term Loan. We terminated the interest rate swap in connection with the repayment of the 2018 Term Loan, resulting in a payment of $4.9 million.\nTrust Preferred Share Issuance\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Trust issued 4,600,000 7.875% Series C Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $115.0 million, or $111.0 million net of underwriters' discount and issuance costs. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Shares will be payable quarterly in arrears, when and as declared by the Company's board of directors on January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30 of each year, beginning on January 30, 2020. Distributions on the Series C Preferred Shares are cumulative.\nSale of Clean Earth\nOn May 8, 2019, the Company, as majority stockholder of CEHI Acquisition Corporation (\"Clean Earth\" or CEHI\u201d) and as Sellers' Representative, entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Calrissian Holdings, LLC ( Buyer\u201d), CEHI, the other holders of stock and options of CEHI and, as Buyer's guarantor, Harsco Corporation, pursuant to which Buyer would acquire all of the issued and outstanding securities of CEHI, the parent company of the operating entity, Clean Earth, Inc.\nOn June 28, 2019, Buyer completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding securities of CEHI pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The sale price for Clean Earth was based on an aggregate total enterprise value of $625 million and is subject to customary working capital adjustments. After the allocation of the sale proceeds to Clean Earth non-controlling equity holders and the payment of transaction expenses of approximately $10.7 million, we received approximately $552 million of total proceeds at closing related to our debt and equity interests in Clean Earth. We recognized a gain on the sale of Clean Earth of $209.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a discussion of the profit allocation associated with the sale of Clean Earth.\nSale of Manitoba Harvest\nOn February 19, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement with Tilray, Inc. (\"Tilray\") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tilray, 1197879 B.C. Ltd. ( Tilray Subco\u201d), to sell to Tilray, through Tilray Subco, all of the issued and outstanding securities of our majority owned subsidiary, Manitoba Harvest for total consideration of up to C$419 million. The completion of the sale of Manitoba Harvest was subject to approval by the British Columbia Supreme Court, which occurred on February 21, 2019. The sale closed on February 28, 2019. Subject to certain customary adjustments, the shareholders of Manitoba Harvest, including the Company, received the following from Tilray as consideration for their shares of Manitoba Harvest: (i) C$150 million in cash to the holders of preferred shares of Manitoba Harvest and the holders of common shares of Manitoba Harvest ( Common Holders\u201d) and C$127.5 million in shares of class 2 Common Stock of Tilray ( Tilray Common Stock\u201d) to the Common Holders on the closing date of the sale (the Closing Date Consideration\u201d), and (ii) C$50 million in cash and C$42.5 million in Tilray Common Stock to the Common Holders on the date that was six months after the closing date of the arrangement (the Deferred Consideration\u201d). The sale consideration also included a potential earnout of up to C$49 million in Tilray Common Stock to the Common Holders, if Manitoba Harvest achieved certain levels of U.S. branded gross sales of edible or topical products containing broad spectrum hemp extracts or cannabidiols prior to December 31, 2019. The threshold for the earnout was not achieved and no additional amount was recorded related to sale of Manitoba Harvest at December 31, 2019.\nThe cash portion of the Closing Date Consideration was reduced by the amount of the net indebtedness (including accrued interest) of Manitoba Harvest on the closing date of C$71.3 million ($53.7 million) and transaction expenses of approximately C$5.0 million. We recognized a gain on the sale of Manitoba Harvest of $121.7 million in the first quarter of 2019. Refer to \"Note L - Stockholders' Equity\" for a discussion of the profit allocation associated with the sale of Manitoba Harvest. Our share of the net proceeds after accounting for the redemption of the noncontrolling shareholders and the payment of net indebtedness of Manitoba Harvest and transaction expenses was approximately $124.2 million in cash proceeds and in Tilray Common Stock. In August 2019, the Company received the Deferred\nConsideration related to the sale. The Company's portion of the Deferred Consideration totaled $28.4 million in cash proceeds and $19.6 million in Tilray Common Stock.\nThe Tilray Common Stock consideration was issued in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and pursuant to exemptions from applicable securities laws of any state of the United States, such that any shares of Tilray Common Stock received by the Common Holders were freely tradeable. We sold the Tilray Common Stock received as part of the Closing Consideration during March 2019, recognizing a net loss of $5.3 million in Other income (expense) during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. In August 2019, the Company sold the Tilray Common Stock received as part of the Deferred Consideration, recognizing a loss of $4.9 million in Other income/ (expense) during the quarter ended September 30, 2019.\n2019 Distributions\nCommon shares - For the 2019 fiscal year we declared distributions to our common shareholders totaling $1.44 per share.\nPreferred shares - For the 2019 fiscal year we declared distributions to our preferred shareholders totaling $1.8125 per share on our Series A Preferred Shares and $1.96875 on our Series B Preferred Shares. We also declared a distribution to our preferred shareholders of $0.38281 per share on our Series C Preferred Shares. The distribution on the Series C Preferred Shares covers the period from, and including, November 20, 2019, the original issue date of the Series C Preferred Shares, up to, but excluding, January 30, 2020.\n2020 Outlook and Significant Trends\nDuring 2019, the middle market continued to be an active segment for deal flow, with continued strong deal flow expected in 2020. High valuation levels continue to be driven by the availability of debt capital with favorable terms and financial and strategic buyers seeking to deploy available equity capital. We believe that companies will focus on expanding their customer bases by diversifying their products and services in existing geographic areas during 2020.\nWe remain focused on marketing the Company's attractive ownership and management attributes to potential sellers of middle market businesses and intermediaries. In addition, we continue to pursue opportunities for add-on acquisitions by certain of our existing subsidiary companies, which can be particularly attractive from a strategic perspective.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor 2020, we anticipate our niche industrial companies, combined as a whole, will continue to grow revenue and earnings as a result of the overall health of the economy. Our branded consumer companies, combined as a whole, may be impacted in 2019 by the continued weakening in the U.S. retail landscape, specifically, lower consumer foot traffic in brick and mortar retail, and the related shift to more online shopping. We believe our branded consumer companies, with their strong positions in their respective markets and powerful brands, remain well positioned to grow revenue and earnings in 2019, notwithstanding this difficult landscape.\nThe areas of focus for 2020, which are generally applicable to each of our businesses, include:\n \u2022 Achieving sales growth through a combination of new product development, increasing distribution and international expansion; \n \u2022 Taking market share, where possible, in each of our niche market leading companies, generally at the expense of less well capitalized competitors; \n \u2022 Striving for excellence in supply chain management, manufacturing and technological capabilities; \n \u2022 Continuing to pursue expense reduction and cost savings in lower margin business lines or in response to lower production volume; \n \u2022 Continuing to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions and rigorous integration processes; and \n \u2022 Driving free cash flow through increased net income and effective working capital management, enabling continued investment in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, and distributions to our shareholders. \nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion reflects a comparison of the historical results of operations of our consolidated business for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and components of the results of operations as well as those components presented as a percent of net revenues, for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis.\nWe acquired Foam Fabricators in February 2018, Velocity Outdoor in June 2017, and our Sterno business acquired Rimports in February 2018. In the following results of operations, we provide (i) our actual Consolidated Results of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, which includes the historical results of operations of each of our businesses (operating segments) from the date of acquisition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\" or \"US GAAP\") and (ii) comparative historical components of the results of operations for each of our businesses on a stand-alone basis ( Results of Operations - Our Businesses\u201d), for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, where all years presented include relevant pro-forma adjustments for pre-acquisition periods and explanations where applicable. For the 2018 acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased these businesses on January 1, 2017. The historical operating results of Rimports have been added to the previously reported Sterno results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the Sterno results of operations for the 2018 period prior to acquisition by Sterno. For the 2017 acquisition of Velocity Outdoor, the pro forma results of operations have been prepared as if we purchased this business on January 1, 2017.

Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $11.6 million and $33.1 million, respectively, to the increase in revenue, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2018. We also saw notable sales increases at 5.11 ($40.7 million), Liberty ($13.5 million) and Velocity ($16.5 million increase as a result of the Ravin acquisition in September 2018). These increases in\nrevenue were partially offset by a decrease in net sales at our Sterno business exclusive of Rimports ($16.8 million decrease) in 2019 as compared to 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of net revenue by business segment.\nWe do not generate any revenues apart from those generated by the businesses we own. We may generate interest income on the investment of available funds, but expect such earnings to be minimal. Our investment in our businesses is typically in the form of loans from the Company to such businesses, as well as equity interests in those businesses. Cash flows coming to the Trust and the Company are the result of interest payments on those loans, amortization of those loans and, in some cases, dividends on our equity ownership. However, on a consolidated basis these items will be eliminated.\nCost of revenues\nOn a consolidated basis, cost of revenues increased approximately $43.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Our acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018 contributed $6.9 million and $20.8 million, respectively, to the increase in cost of revenues, reflecting a full year of ownership compared to the corresponding period in 2018. We also saw notable increases in cost of sales at 5.11 ($9.9 million), Liberty ($12.1 million) and Velocity ($10.3 million) corresponding to the increase in net sales noted above. This was partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales at our legacy Sterno business exclusive of Rimports of $16.3 million.\nGross profit as a percentage of net revenues was approximately 35.8% in year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 34.6% in 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of gross profit by business segment.\nSelling, general and administrative expense\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative expense increased approximately $15.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to the corresponding period in 2018. Refer to \"Results of Operations - Our Businesses\" for a more detailed analysis of selling, general and administrative expense by business segment. At the corporate level, general and administrative expense increased from $14.3 million in 2018 to $14.9 million in 2019, primarily due to transaction costs associated with an unsuccessful acquisition.\nFees to manager\nPursuant to the Management Services Agreement, we pay CGM a quarterly management fee equal to 0.5% (2.0% annually) of our consolidated adjusted net assets. We accrue for the management fee on a quarterly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred approximately $37.0 million in expense for these fees compared to $43.4 million for the corresponding period in 2018. The $6.4 million decrease in the year ended December 31, 2019 is principally due to the sales of Manitoba Harvest in the first quarter of 2019 and Clean earth in the second quarter of 2019. Concurrent with the June 2019 sale of Clean Earth, CGM agree to waive the management fee on cash balances held at the Company, commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2019 and continuing until the quarter in which the Company next borrows under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $4.5 million to $54.2 million as compared to the prior year, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Foam Fabricators and Rimports in February 2018, and Ravin in September 2018.\nImpairment expense\nVelocity Outdoor performed an interim impairment test of their goodwill during the quarter ended September 30, 2019 as a result of operating results below forecasts in the current period as well as a re-forecast of the Velocity business in which planned earnings and revenue fell below the forecasts of prior periods. The impairment test resulted in Velocity Outdoor recording impairment expense of $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nInterest Expense\nWe recorded interest expense totaling $58.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $55.2 million for the comparable period in 2018, an increase of $3.0 million. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects the interest associated with the issuance of our Senior Notes in April 2018. We recorded $32.0 million in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $22.5 million in interest expense for the period from the date of issuance through December 31, 2018 related to the Senior Notes. This increase in interest expense as a result of the full"}
