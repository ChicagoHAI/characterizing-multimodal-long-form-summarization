MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can stimulate inflammation, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. We believe our proprietary know-how in enzyme technology allows for the design, development, formulation, and scalable manufacturing of non-absorbed and stable enzymes delivered orally and in sufficient doses for activity in the gastrointestinal tract. This approach enables us to develop enzyme therapies that degrade metabolites within the GI tract, which reduces potentially toxic metabolite levels in the blood and urine, and in turn, diminishes the disease burden including on the kidney over time.\nOur product candidate, ALLN-346, is an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. We have conducted a Phase 1 program, including both a single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. In both studies, ALLN-346 was well tolerated with no clinically significant safety signals and no dose-limiting toxicities observed in any cohort up to the highest administered dose. We are currently conducting two Phase 2a studies. Study 201 is a 7-day inpatient study in patients with hyperuricemia, for which we reported initial data in January 2022. Study 202 is a 14-day outpatient study in patients with hyperuricemia, gout and varying degrees of renal insufficiency, for which we expect to report initial data in Q2 2022.\nWe previously had been developing reloxaliase, a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate, or UOx, levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and ESRD. However, in March 2022 we terminated this program following the first of two planned Sample Size Reestimations (SSR1) of the Phase 3 URIROX-2 Trial, which was conducted by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) statistician. Based on the results of its unblinded analysis, the DSMB recommended that the trial size be increased from the initial 200 subjects to the maximum allowed number of 400 subjects under the pre-specified rules. However, even with this maximum recommended sample size increase, the power to detect an effect of reloxaliase vs. placebo would still be less than 80% based on the available data. Based upon this recommendation, we believe that the separation between the reloxaliase and placebo groups for the UOx primary endpoint is lower than expected, and therefore that the likelihood of success for the long term endpoint of reduction in kidney stone disease progression is also lower than expected. We have therefore decided to terminate the URIROX-2 study. No further clinical studies of reloxaliase are planned at this time.\nIn July 2021, we completed a registered direct offering, in which we issued and sold 17,416,096 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,941,648 shares of our common stock in lieu of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 10,678,872 shares of our common stock through a securities purchase agreement. The combined price of each share of common stock and accompanying Warrant to purchase one-half of a share was $1.311. The purchase price of each Pre-funded Warrant was $1.301, which was the combined purchase price per share of common stock and accompanying Warrant, minus $0.01. Gross proceeds of the transaction were $28.0 million. As a result of the registered direct offering, we received approximately $25.4 million after deducting estimated offering costs. Each Warrant is exercisable for one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. The Warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on July 16, 2026. Each Pre-funded Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The Pre-funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full. All Pre-funded Warrants were exercised on July 16, 2021.\nIn March 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold a total of 4,081,338 shares of our common stock under the B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $1.11 per share for net proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.\nIn December 2021, we entered into an updated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d), which was essentially identical to the initial agreement, but utilized a shelf registration statement that we also filed at that time. During the first quarter of 2022 through the filing date of this Annual Report, we issued and sold 6,804,888 shares of our common stock under the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $0.62 per share for net proceeds of $4.1 million. The B. Riley ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we issued and sold 6,058,318 shares of our common stock under an At-the Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (\"Cowen ATM Agreement\") at a weighted average price of $1.99 per share for net proceeds of $11.7 million. The Cowen ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nIn December 2020, we completed a public underwritten offering of 11,960,000 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 1,560,000 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $1.25 per share for net proceeds of $13.5 million.\nIn July 2020, we completed a public underwritten offering of 5,894,191 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 768,807 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $1.30 per share for net proceeds of $6.7 million.\nIn June 2020, we completed a registered direct offering, in which we issued and sold 7,317,074 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $2.05 per share, for net proceeds of $13.7 million through a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors. The shares of common stock sold in this offering were offered by us pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 26, 2018 and a prospectus supplement thereunder filed on June 5, 2020.\nOur operations to date have been primarily focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, manufacturing our product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of reloxaliase and ALLN-346. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $30.0 million, and as of March 31, 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.0 million.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and, provided we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net losses were $48.7 million, $32.8 million and $47.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $246.5 million. If we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:\n\u2022advance the development and conduct future clinical trials of ALLN-346;\n\u2022conduct research on the discovery and development of additional product candidates;\n\u2022seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, operational, and financial personnel, to execute our business plan; and\n\u2022add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nNASDAQ Delisting Notification\nOn August 25, 2021, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff\u201d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) notifying us that, for the 30 consecutive business day period between July 14, 2021 through August 24, 2021, our common stock had not maintained a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Nasdaq letter does not result in the immediate delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (the Compliance Period Rule\u201d), we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until February 21, 2022 (the Compliance Date\u201d), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On February 22, 2022 we applied to transfer our securities to Nasdaq Capital Market and requested a second 180-day period to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On February 24, 2022, Nasdaq approved our request for a second 180-day period, or until August 22, 2022, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If, at any time during this 180-day period, the closing bid price for our common stock closes at $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification to us that we comply with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the common stock will continue to be eligible for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf it appears to the Staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, the Staff will provide written notice to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Staff's delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the Panel\u201d). We expect that our stock would remain listed pending the Panel's decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal the Staff's delisting determination to the Panel, such appeal would be successful.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, which could include seeking to effect a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or maintain compliance with any of the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other source and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for ALLN-346 or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs, that conduct research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n\u2022costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to CMOs;\n\u2022consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities;\n\u2022costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our research and development activities;\n\u2022costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred\nand capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nWe are developing ALLN-346 for patients with hyperuricemia and CKD. We began incurring external research and development costs for this program in 2016. We recently terminated development of reloxaliase, which we had been developing for the treatment of enteric hyperoxaluria and which had accounted for the substantial majority of our research and development expenses over the past three years.\nWe typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands):\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reloxaliase external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ALLN-346 external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Since inception, we have incurred $107.3 million of external research and development costs for reloxaliase and $18.2 million of external research and development costs for ALLN-346. Provided that we are able to secure sufficient capital to continue our operations, we expect that our research and development costs will increase in future years as we advance our ALLN-346 program, including initiating additional clinical trials and scaling our manufacturing processes.\nThe successful development of ALLN-346 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials for ALLN-346;\n\u2022establishing an appropriate safety profile for any potential future product candidates with studies to enable the filing of investigational new drug application, or INDs;\n\u2022approval of INDs for any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials;\n\u2022significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n\u2022timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022making arrangements with CMOs for third-party commercial manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n\u2022commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n\u2022maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include directors' and officers' insurance, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist of severance, bonus and other related costs incurred as a result of a reduction of our workforce completed in December 2019.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred on our credit facility, amortized debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the advances under our former credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and related debt issuance costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, primarily consists of a success fee paid to Pacific Western Bank, or PWB, during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with our loan agreement with PWB, or PWB Loan Agreement, and gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and CMOs in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees, directors non-employees. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We weigh our own historical volatility of our own stock price and the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies for the computation of expected volatility used for estimating the fair value of option grants. We will increase the weighting on the historical volatility of our own stock price over the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies until such time as we have a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla\u201d nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock.

The following table summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dollar\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consulting and professional services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(378\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Market research and commercialization planning\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(499\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,927\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $1.9 million increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Our employee compensation and benefits costs increased by $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in employee salaries, wages, benefit costs and stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation increased $1.0 million from $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020;\n\u2022Our consulting and professional services costs decreased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to decreased recruiting costs and investor and public relations costs;\n\u2022Our market research and commercialization planning costs decreased by $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred costs of $0.4 million for a study with an independent third party to perform a market assessment for enteric hyperoxaluria. There were no comparable costs for the year ended December 31, 2020; and\n\u2022Our other costs increased by $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in directors' and officers' insurance costs.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist of severance, bonus and other related costs incurred as a result of a reduction of our workforce completed in December 2019.\nInterest Income (Expense), net\nInterest income (expense), net consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense charged on our outstanding debt, and amortization of our debt discount. We had net interest expense of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and net interest income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest earned as a result of lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to average balances of cash and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists of a success fee paid to PWB and gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions. Included in other expenses, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was a success fee of $0.3 million paid to PWB. The conditions required to meet the obligation were fulfilled at the time we completed our registered direct offering on June 5, 2020 and we expensed the success fee at this time.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations from inception through December 31, 2021 through gross proceeds of $96.0 million from sales of our convertible preferred stock, net proceeds of $67.0 million from our IPO which was completed in November 2017, net proceeds totaling $33.8 million from follow-on offerings of common stock during 2020, borrowings of $10.0 million under our credit facilities, net proceeds of $14.6 million and $4.2 million from the sale of our common stock under the Cowen ATM\nAgreement and the B. Riley ATM Agreement, respectively, and net proceeds of $25.4 million from the registered direct offering completed in July 2021. Our total cash and cash equivalents were $30.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\nWe entered into an updated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d) on December 23, 2021. During the first quarter of 2022 through the filing date of this Annual Report, we issued and sold 6,804,888 shares of our common stock under the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $0.62 per share for net proceeds of $4.1 million. The shares were issued and sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 we filed on May 6, 2021, which was declared effective on May 12, 2021 (File No. 333-255837), for the offering of up to $200 million in the aggregate of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units ( securities\u201d) from time to time in one or more offerings. As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not offered any other securities pursuant to this shelf registration. The initial B. Riley ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nOn September 29, 2020, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Pontifax Medison Finance (Israel) L.P. and Pontifax Medison Finance (Cayman) L.P. (together Pontifax\u201d) ( Pontifax Agreement\u201d) providing up to $25.0 million of borrowings through three facilities of a term loan. An initial loan ( Initial Loan) of $10.0 million was advanced on September 29, 2020. A portion of these proceeds were used to pay the remaining balance of our credit facility with PWB and terminate the PWB Loan Agreement. We also had an additional $5.0 million credit line ( Credit Line\u201d) that was available to us for withdrawal until September 29, 2021. We did not withdraw any amounts available through the Credit Line prior to the expiration of the availability period. We paid a fee of 1.0% per annum to Pontifax for the daily average amount not withdrawn under the Credit Line during the period amounts were available for withdrawal. A third installment loan (Third Installment Loan\u201d) of an additional $10.0 million was conditioned upon achievement of one of the following milestones by no later than December 29, 2021: (i) we receive non-contingent, non-refundable gross proceeds from one or more equity financings and/or strategic partnerships, in each case consummated following the Closing Date, in the aggregate amount of at least $15.0 million for all such equity financings and strategic partnerships or (ii) the 65th patient has been enrolled in the URIROX-2 trial. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the additional $10 million under the Third Installment Loan became available to us for withdrawal until December 29, 2021 when we satisfied the milestone of at least $15 million of gross proceeds from equity financings. We did not withdraw any amounts available through the Third Installment Loan prior to expiration of the availability period.\nThe Pontifax Agreement has a term of 48 months and an interest only period of 24 months. Amounts outstanding under the Pontifax Agreement have a fixed interest rate of 9.0% per annum. Upon the expiration of the interest only period on September 29, 2022, amounts borrowed will be repaid over eight equal quarterly payments of principal and interest. At our option, we may prepay all or part of the outstanding borrowings at any time without any prepayment premium or penalty. During the first quarter of 2022, we prepaid $5.0 million of the outstanding principal balance. In light of our recent termination of the reloxaliase development program and certain acceleration provisions in the Pontifax Agreement, we have classified the amounts due under the Pontifax loan as a current liability.\nAt the option of Pontifax, amounts outstanding under the Pontifax Agreement may be converted at any time into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.10 per share. In addition, we have the right to convert at any time any portion of the then outstanding borrowings and all accrued but unpaid interest into shares of our common stock, at the applicable conversion price, subject to the fulfillment of both of the following conditions: (i) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which we provide notice of the exercise of our conversion right, the closing price of our common stock was higher than 1.4 times the applicable conversion price of the term loans on at least 20 trading days, including on the trading day preceding the date we provide notice of the exercise of our conversion right and (ii) the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion by us shall not exceed the average weekly number of shares of our common stock traded on the stock market for the four weeks immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of the exercise of our conversion right.\nThe borrowings under the Pontifax Agreement are secured by a lien on all of our assets except intellectual property. The Pontifax Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants by us, including negative covenants restricting our activities, such as disposing of our business or certain assets, incurring additional debt or liens or making payments on other debt, making certain investments and declaring dividends, acquiring or merging with another entity, engaging in transactions with affiliates or encumbering intellectual property, among others. The obligations under the Pontifax Agreement are subject to acceleration upon occurrence of specified events of default, including a material adverse change in our business, operations or financial or other condition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(45,678\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(28,159\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(43,632\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(667\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(632\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,636\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nThe cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from our net losses adjusted for non-cash charges and changes in components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $17.5 million was attributable to:\n\u2022 An increase in net loss of $15.8 million;\n\u2022A decrease in non-cash items of $0.4 million resulting primarily from increases in stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022A decrease of $1.3 million due to changes in the components of working capital.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $43.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cash used in operating activities of $15.4 million was attributable to:\n\u2022a decrease in net loss of $14.4 million;\n\u2022An increase in non-cash items of $1.2 million resulting primarily from increases in stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022A decrease of $0.2 million due to changes in the components of working capital.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash used in investing activities related to net purchases of property and equipment.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $41.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily consisted of net proceeds of $11.7 million and $4.2 from the sale of common stock under the Cowen ATM Agreement and the B. Riley ATM Agreement, respectively, and $25.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance and sale of 17,416,096 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,941,648 shares of our common stock in lieu of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 10,678,872 shares of our common stock completed on July 16, 2021 through a registered direct offering, respectively. .\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $34.0 million from the issuance and sale of our common stock through the registered direct offering completed in June 2020 and our public underwritten offerings completed in July 2020 and December 2020.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to net proceeds of $12.0 million from the issuance and sale of our common stock through the registered direct offering completed in June 2019 and under our ATM facility completed in December 2019.\nFunding Requirements\nProvided that we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development for, initiate later stage clinical trials for, and seek marketing approval for, ALLN-346 and any other product candidates we may develop. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding\nin connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nGoing Concern\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $30.0 million, and as of March 31, 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.0 million. Based on our current operating plans, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this Annual Report. We do not believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2022 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements beyond the next several weeks. We will require additional capital to sustain our operations, including our ALLN-346 development program, beyond that time.\nOn March 18, 2022, we announced our decision to terminate our URIROX-2 study for reloxaliase and initiated the process of closing the study with our CRO, investigative sites, patients and business partners. In connection with the termination of the reloxaliase program, we completed a workforce reduction of approximately 40% in March 2022.\nWe are exploring opportunities to secure additional funding through equity or debt financings or through collaborations, licensing transactions or other sources. In January 2022, we initiated a process to explore a range of strategic and financing alternatives to maximize shareholder value and have engaged the investment bank Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc. (\"Stifel\") to act as strategic advisor for this process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include a partnership or sale of ALLN-346, a sale or merger of the Company, or securing additional financing to enable further development of our ALLN-346 program. There can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in the pursuit of any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed. The failure to obtain sufficient additional funds on commercially acceptable terms to fund our operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and jeopardize our ability to continue operations in the near-term. We will likely need to consider additional cost reduction strategies, which may include, among others, amending, delaying, limiting, reducing, or terminating the development program for ALLN-346, and we may need to seek an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities. In the event of such future bankruptcy proceeding, holders of our common stock and other securities will likely suffer a total loss of their investment.\nAs part of the strategic process, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a retention plan on January 28, 2022, available to all employees (\"Retention Plan\"). Employees were required to execute retention agreements to receive payments and other considerations offered by the Retention Plan. Employees who executed a retention agreement received a salary adjustment equal to 6.5% retroactive to January 1, 2022, a restricted stock unit (\"RSU\") grant and a lump sum retention payment. A total of 3,163,000 RSUs were granted on February 1, 2022 under the Retention Plan. The RSUs vest over a three-year period ratably on July 15th and January 15th of each year following grant date. Lump sum retention payments totaling $3.0 million were made to employees in February 2022. If an employee resigns from the Company or is terminated for cause prior to June 30, 2022, the employee would be required to fully repay the lump sum retention payment received. If an employee resigns from the Company or is terminated for cause between July 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022, the employee would be required to repay 50% of the lump sum retention payment received.\nMarket volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors could also adversely impact our ability to access capital as and when needed. The failure to obtain sufficient funds on commercially acceptable terms when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and jeopardize our ability to continue operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We may implement cost reduction strategies, which may include amending, delaying, limiting, reducing, or terminating one or more of our ongoing or planned clinical trials or development programs of our product candidates. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business for the foreseeable future. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including;\n\u2022the costs of conducting future clinical trials and other development activities to advance ALLN-346;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for other potential product candidates we may develop, if any;\n\u2022the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we might have at such time;\n\u2022the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;\n\u2022the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the expansion of our workforce and associated costs as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and\n\u2022the costs of operating as a public company.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of products that we do not expect to be commercially available for many years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe do not have any committed external sources of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.", "summary": "The report provides a detailed discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for a biopharmaceutical company.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can stimulate inflammation, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. We believe our proprietary know-how in enzyme technology allows for the design, development, formulation, and scalable manufacturing of non-absorbed and stable enzymes delivered orally and in sufficient doses for activity in the gastrointestinal tract. This approach enables us to develop enzyme therapies that degrade metabolites within the GI tract, which reduces potentially toxic metabolite levels in the blood and urine, and in turn, diminishes the disease burden including on the kidney over time.\nOur product candidate, ALLN-346, is an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. We have conducted a Phase 1 program, including both a single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. In both studies, ALLN-346 was well tolerated with no clinically significant safety signals and no dose-limiting toxicities observed in any cohort up to the highest administered dose. We are currently conducting two Phase 2a studies. Study 201 is a 7-day inpatient study in patients with hyperuricemia, for which we reported initial data in January 2022. Study 202 is a 14-day outpatient study in patients with hyperuricemia, gout and varying degrees of renal insufficiency, for which we expect to report initial data in Q2 2022.\nWe previously had been developing reloxaliase, a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate, or UOx, levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and ESRD. However, in March 2022 we terminated this program following the first of two planned Sample Size Reestimations (SSR1) of the Phase 3 URIROX-2 Trial, which was conducted by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) statistician. Based on the results of its unblinded analysis, the DSMB recommended that the trial size be increased from the initial 200 subjects to the maximum allowed number of 400 subjects under the pre-specified rules. However, even with this maximum recommended sample size increase, the power to detect an effect of reloxaliase vs. placebo would still be less than 80% based on the available data. Based upon this recommendation, we believe that the separation between the reloxaliase and placebo groups for the UOx primary endpoint is lower than expected, and therefore that the likelihood of success for the long term endpoint of reduction in kidney stone disease progression is also lower than expected. We have therefore decided to terminate the URIROX-2 study. No further clinical studies of reloxaliase are planned at this time.\nIn July 2021, we completed a registered direct offering, in which we issued and sold 17,416,096 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,941,648 shares of our common stock in lieu of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 10,678,872 shares of our common stock through a securities purchase agreement. The combined price of each share of common stock and accompanying Warrant to purchase one-half of a share was $1.311. The purchase price of each Pre-funded Warrant was $1.301, which was the combined purchase price per share of common stock and accompanying Warrant, minus $0.01. Gross proceeds of the transaction were $28.0 million. As a result of the registered direct offering, we received approximately $25.4 million after deducting estimated offering costs. Each Warrant is exercisable for one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. The Warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on July 16, 2026. Each Pre-funded Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The Pre-funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full. All Pre-funded Warrants were exercised on July 16, 2021.\nIn March 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold a total of 4,081,338 shares of our common stock under the B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $1.11 per share for net proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.\nIn December 2021, we entered into an updated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d), which was essentially identical to the initial agreement, but utilized a shelf registration statement that we also filed at that time. During the first quarter of 2022 through the filing date of this Annual Report, we issued and sold 6,804,888 shares of our common stock under the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $0.62 per share for net proceeds of $4.1 million. The B. Riley ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we issued and sold 6,058,318 shares of our common stock under an At-the Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (\"Cowen ATM Agreement\") at a weighted average price of $1.99 per share for net proceeds of $11.7 million. The Cowen ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nIn December 2020, we completed a public underwritten offering of 11,960,000 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 1,560,000 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $1.25 per share for net proceeds of $13.5 million.\nIn July 2020, we completed a public underwritten offering of 5,894,191 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 768,807 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $1.30 per share for net proceeds of $6.7 million.\nIn June 2020, we completed a registered direct offering, in which we issued and sold 7,317,074 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $2.05 per share, for net proceeds of $13.7 million through a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors. The shares of common stock sold in this offering were offered by us pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 26, 2018 and a prospectus supplement thereunder filed on June 5, 2020.\nOur operations to date have been primarily focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, manufacturing our product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of reloxaliase and ALLN-346. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $30.0 million, and as of March 31, 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.0 million.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and, provided we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net losses were $48.7 million, $32.8 million and $47.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $246.5 million. If we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:\n\u2022advance the development and conduct future clinical trials of ALLN-346;\n\u2022conduct research on the discovery and development of additional product candidates;\n\u2022seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, operational, and financial personnel, to execute our business plan; and\n\u2022add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nNASDAQ Delisting Notification\nOn August 25, 2021, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff\u201d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) notifying us that, for the 30 consecutive business day period between July 14, 2021 through August 24, 2021, our common stock had not maintained a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Nasdaq letter does not result in the immediate delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (the Compliance Period Rule\u201d), we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until February 21, 2022 (the Compliance Date\u201d), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On February 22, 2022 we applied to transfer our securities to Nasdaq Capital Market and requested a second 180-day period to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On February 24, 2022, Nasdaq approved our request for a second 180-day period, or until August 22, 2022, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If, at any time during this 180-day period, the closing bid price for our common stock closes at $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification to us that we comply with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the common stock will continue to be eligible for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf it appears to the Staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, the Staff will provide written notice to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Staff's delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the Panel\u201d). We expect that our stock would remain listed pending the Panel's decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal the Staff's delisting determination to the Panel, such appeal would be successful.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, which could include seeking to effect a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or maintain compliance with any of the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other source and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for ALLN-346 or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs, that conduct research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n\u2022costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to CMOs;\n\u2022consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities;\n\u2022costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our research and development activities;\n\u2022costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred\nand capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nWe are developing ALLN-346 for patients with hyperuricemia and CKD. We began incurring external research and development costs for this program in 2016. We recently terminated development of reloxaliase, which we had been developing for the treatment of enteric hyperoxaluria and which had accounted for the substantial majority of our research and development expenses over the past three years.\nWe typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands):\n\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Since inception, we have incurred $107.3 million of external research and development costs for reloxaliase and $18.2 million of external research and development costs for ALLN-346. Provided that we are able to secure sufficient capital to continue our operations, we expect that our research and development costs will increase in future years as we advance our ALLN-346 program, including initiating additional clinical trials and scaling our manufacturing processes.\nThe successful development of ALLN-346 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials for ALLN-346;\n\u2022establishing an appropriate safety profile for any potential future product candidates with studies to enable the filing of investigational new drug application, or INDs;\n\u2022approval of INDs for any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials;\n\u2022significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n\u2022timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022making arrangements with CMOs for third-party commercial manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n\u2022commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n\u2022maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include directors' and officers' insurance, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist of severance, bonus and other related costs incurred as a result of a reduction of our workforce completed in December 2019.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred on our credit facility, amortized debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the advances under our former credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and related debt issuance costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, primarily consists of a success fee paid to Pacific Western Bank, or PWB, during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with our loan agreement with PWB, or PWB Loan Agreement, and gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and CMOs in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees, directors non-employees. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We weigh our own historical volatility of our own stock price and the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies for the computation of expected volatility used for estimating the fair value of option grants. We will increase the weighting on the historical volatility of our own stock price over the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies until such time as we have a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla\u201d nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors for their services on the board of directors was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $5.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 2.5 years. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock units remaining to be recognized. Provided we are able to secure adequate funding to continue operations, we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, potential increases in the value of our common stock and expected additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain our employees.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutics to treat patients with rare and severe metabolic and kidney disorders. We are focused on metabolic disorders that result in excess accumulation of certain metabolites that can stimulate inflammation, damage the kidney, and potentially lead to chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and end-stage renal disease, or ESRD. We believe our proprietary know-how in enzyme technology allows for the design, development, formulation, and scalable manufacturing of non-absorbed and stable enzymes delivered orally and in sufficient doses for activity in the gastrointestinal tract. This approach enables us to develop enzyme therapies that degrade metabolites within the GI tract, which reduces potentially toxic metabolite levels in the blood and urine, and in turn, diminishes the disease burden including on the kidney over time.\nOur product candidate, ALLN-346, is an orally administered, novel, urate degrading enzyme for patients with hyperuricemia and gout in the setting of advanced CKD. We have conducted a Phase 1 program, including both a single-ascending dose and multiple-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. In both studies, ALLN-346 was well tolerated with no clinically significant safety signals and no dose-limiting toxicities observed in any cohort up to the highest administered dose. We are currently conducting two Phase 2a studies. Study 201 is a 7-day inpatient study in patients with hyperuricemia, for which we reported initial data in January 2022. Study 202 is a 14-day outpatient study in patients with hyperuricemia, gout and varying degrees of renal insufficiency, for which we expect to report initial data in Q2 2022.\nWe previously had been developing reloxaliase, a first-in-class, oral enzyme therapeutic for the treatment of hyperoxaluria, a metabolic disorder characterized by markedly elevated urinary oxalate, or UOx, levels and commonly associated with kidney stones, CKD and ESRD. However, in March 2022 we terminated this program following the first of two planned Sample Size Reestimations (SSR1) of the Phase 3 URIROX-2 Trial, which was conducted by an independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) statistician. Based on the results of its unblinded analysis, the DSMB recommended that the trial size be increased from the initial 200 subjects to the maximum allowed number of 400 subjects under the pre-specified rules. However, even with this maximum recommended sample size increase, the power to detect an effect of reloxaliase vs. placebo would still be less than 80% based on the available data. Based upon this recommendation, we believe that the separation between the reloxaliase and placebo groups for the UOx primary endpoint is lower than expected, and therefore that the likelihood of success for the long term endpoint of reduction in kidney stone disease progression is also lower than expected. We have therefore decided to terminate the URIROX-2 study. No further clinical studies of reloxaliase are planned at this time.\nIn July 2021, we completed a registered direct offering, in which we issued and sold 17,416,096 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 3,941,648 shares of our common stock in lieu of shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 10,678,872 shares of our common stock through a securities purchase agreement. The combined price of each share of common stock and accompanying Warrant to purchase one-half of a share was $1.311. The purchase price of each Pre-funded Warrant was $1.301, which was the combined purchase price per share of common stock and accompanying Warrant, minus $0.01. Gross proceeds of the transaction were $28.0 million. As a result of the registered direct offering, we received approximately $25.4 million after deducting estimated offering costs. Each Warrant is exercisable for one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. The Warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on July 16, 2026. Each Pre-funded Warrant is exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The Pre-funded Warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised at any time until all Pre-funded Warrants are exercised in full. All Pre-funded Warrants were exercised on July 16, 2021.\nIn March 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued and sold a total of 4,081,338 shares of our common stock under the B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $1.11 per share for net proceeds of approximately $4.2 million.\nIn December 2021, we entered into an updated At Market Issuance Sales Agreement with B. Riley Securities, Inc. ( Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement\u201d), which was essentially identical to the initial agreement, but utilized a shelf registration statement that we also filed at that time. During the first quarter of 2022 through the filing date of this Annual Report, we issued and sold 6,804,888 shares of our common stock under the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement at a weighted average price of $0.62 per share for net proceeds of $4.1 million. The B. Riley ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the Updated B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we issued and sold 6,058,318 shares of our common stock under an At-the Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (\"Cowen ATM Agreement\") at a weighted average price of $1.99 per share for net proceeds of $11.7 million. The Cowen ATM Agreement was terminated at the time we entered into the B. Riley ATM Agreement.\nIn December 2020, we completed a public underwritten offering of 11,960,000 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 1,560,000 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $1.25 per share for net proceeds of $13.5 million.\nIn July 2020, we completed a public underwritten offering of 5,894,191 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full of the underwriter's option to purchase an additional 768,807 shares of common stock, at a price to the public of $1.30 per share for net proceeds of $6.7 million.\nIn June 2020, we completed a registered direct offering, in which we issued and sold 7,317,074 shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $2.05 per share, for net proceeds of $13.7 million through a securities purchase agreement with certain institutional and accredited investors. The shares of common stock sold in this offering were offered by us pursuant to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC, which was declared effective on December 26, 2018 and a prospectus supplement thereunder filed on June 5, 2020.\nOur operations to date have been primarily focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, manufacturing our product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of reloxaliase and ALLN-346. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue to date. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $30.0 million, and as of March 31, 2022 we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.0 million.\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses in every year since our inception and, provided we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. Our net losses were $48.7 million, $32.8 million and $47.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $246.5 million. If we are able to secure adequate financing to continue our operations, we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly as we:\n\u2022advance the development and conduct future clinical trials of ALLN-346;\n\u2022conduct research on the discovery and development of additional product candidates;\n\u2022seek regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval in geographies in which we plan to commercialize our products ourselves;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022hire additional staff, including clinical, scientific, technical, operational, and financial personnel, to execute our business plan; and\n\u2022add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts, and to enable us to operate as a public company.\nWe do not expect to generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. Additionally, we currently use contract research organizations, or CROs, and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to carry out our preclinical and clinical development activities. We do not yet have a sales organization. If we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Furthermore, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, including strategic collaborations. We may, however, be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and impact our ability to continue as a going concern.\nNASDAQ Delisting Notification\nOn August 25, 2021, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff\u201d) of the Nasdaq Stock Market ( Nasdaq\u201d) notifying us that, for the 30 consecutive business day period between July 14, 2021 through August 24, 2021, our common stock had not maintained a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d) required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Nasdaq letter does not result in the immediate delisting of our common stock from The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) (the Compliance Period Rule\u201d), we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until February 21, 2022 (the Compliance Date\u201d), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On February 22, 2022 we applied to transfer our securities to Nasdaq Capital Market and requested a second 180-day period to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. On February 24, 2022, Nasdaq approved our request for a second 180-day period, or until August 22, 2022, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If, at any time during this 180-day period, the closing bid price for our common stock closes at $1.00 or more per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, as required under the Compliance Period Rule, the Staff will provide written notification to us that we comply with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the common stock will continue to be eligible for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf it appears to the Staff that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, the Staff will provide written notice to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Staff's delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearing Panel (the Panel\u201d). We expect that our stock would remain listed pending the Panel's decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal the Staff's delisting determination to the Panel, such appeal would be successful.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, which could include seeking to effect a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or maintain compliance with any of the other Nasdaq continued listing requirements.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales or any other source and do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. If our development efforts for ALLN-346 or other product candidates that we may develop in the future are successful and result in marketing approval or collaboration or license agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue in the future from a combination of product sales or payments from such collaboration or license agreements.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts and the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022costs incurred under agreements with third parties, including CROs, that conduct research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf;\n\u2022costs related to production of preclinical and clinical materials, including fees paid to CMOs;\n\u2022consulting, licensing and professional fees related to research and development activities;\n\u2022costs of purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our research and development activities;\n\u2022costs related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022facility costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment, or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred\nand capitalized, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.\nWe are developing ALLN-346 for patients with hyperuricemia and CKD. We began incurring external research and development costs for this program in 2016. We recently terminated development of reloxaliase, which we had been developing for the treatment of enteric hyperoxaluria and which had accounted for the substantial majority of our research and development expenses over the past three years.\nWe typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs and other internal costs to specific product candidates or development programs.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by program (in thousands):\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reloxaliase external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ALLN-346 external costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employee compensation and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. Since inception, we have incurred $107.3 million of external research and development costs for reloxaliase and $18.2 million of external research and development costs for ALLN-346. Provided that we are able to secure sufficient capital to continue our operations, we expect that our research and development costs will increase in future years as we advance our ALLN-346 program, including initiating additional clinical trials and scaling our manufacturing processes.\nThe successful development of ALLN-346 and other potential future product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will generate revenue and material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. We may never succeed in achieving regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. The duration, costs and timing of preclinical studies, clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials for ALLN-346;\n\u2022establishing an appropriate safety profile for any potential future product candidates with studies to enable the filing of investigational new drug application, or INDs;\n\u2022approval of INDs for any potential future product candidate to commence planned or future clinical trials;\n\u2022significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;\n\u2022timing and receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022making arrangements with CMOs for third-party commercial manufacturing of our product candidates;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;\n\u2022commercializing the product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022acceptance of the product, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n\u2022maintenance of a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs following approval.\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development, manufacture or commercialization enabling activities of any of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs, timing and viability associated with the development of that product candidate.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business development and human resources functions. Other significant costs include directors' and officers' insurance, facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters and professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services.\nWe expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued research and development activities and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These increases will likely include increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants, attorneys and accountants, among other expenses.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist of severance, bonus and other related costs incurred as a result of a reduction of our workforce completed in December 2019.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net, primarily consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, interest expense incurred on our credit facility, amortized debt discount related to the fair value of the warrants issued in conjunction with the advances under our former credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, and related debt issuance costs.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net, primarily consists of a success fee paid to Pacific Western Bank, or PWB, during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with our loan agreement with PWB, or PWB Loan Agreement, and gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing purchase orders and open contracts, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the services when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses include the costs incurred for services performed by CROs and CMOs in connection with research and development activities for which we have not yet been invoiced.\nWe contract with CROs and CMOs to conduct clinical and manufacturing and other research and development services on our behalf. We base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with them. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our CROs or CMOs will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the research and development expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or amount of prepaid expense accordingly. Non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made.\nAlthough we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences between our estimates of such expenses and the amounts actually incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718, for stock-based awards granted to employees, directors non-employees. We estimate the fair value of each stock option grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We recognize the corresponding stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model uses the following inputs: the fair value of our common stock, the expected volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. Due to the lack of a public market for our common stock prior to our IPO and a lack of company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our computation of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development, life science industry focus, length of trading history and similar vesting provisions. The historical volatility data is calculated based on a period of time commensurate with the expected term assumption. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available or until circumstances change, such that the identified entities are no longer representative companies. In the latter case, more suitable, similar entities whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation. We weigh our own historical volatility of our own stock price and the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies for the computation of expected volatility used for estimating the fair value of option grants. We will increase the weighting on the historical volatility of our own stock price over the historical volatility of a representative group of public companies until such time as we have a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock. We use the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term for options granted to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. Under this approach, the weighted-average expected option term is presumed to be the average of the contractual term (ten years) and the vesting term (generally four years) of our stock options. We utilize this method due to lack of historical exercise data and the plain-vanilla\u201d nature of our stock-based awards. The expected term is applied to the stock option grant group as a whole, as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post-vesting termination behavior among our employee population. For options granted to non-employees, we utilize the contractual term of the arrangement as the basis for the expected term assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and have no current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nThe fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors for their services on the board of directors was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following range of assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 40: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4% - 1.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4% - 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4% - 2.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected term (in years)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0 - 7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5 - 6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5 - 6.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92% - 95%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94% - 95%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80% - 83%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the classification of our stock-based compensation expense recognized in our statements of operations and comprehensive loss (in thousands):\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,765\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $5.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock option awards, which is expected to be recognized over weighted-average remaining vesting periods of approximately 2.5 years. As of December 31, 2021, we did not have any unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock units remaining to be recognized. Provided we are able to secure adequate funding to continue operations, we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase, due in part to our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, potential increases in the value of our common stock and expected additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain our employees.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
