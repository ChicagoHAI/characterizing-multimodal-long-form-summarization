MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying financial statement notes of the Company appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. All dollar amounts are presented in millions except share, per share, per day and vessel amounts. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements, including as a result of the factors we describe under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors\u201d set forth in Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nBusiness\nRand was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2004 as a blank check company. In 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Lower Lakes Towing Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes Towing\") with its subsidiary Lower Lakes Transportation Company (\"Lower Lakes Transportation\") and its affiliate, Grand River Navigation Company, Inc. (\"Grand River\"). Subsequent to our acquisition of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation and Grand River, we acquired eleven additional vessels and retired three vessels.\nIn this Yearly Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to Rand, we, us and the Company include Rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and references to the Lower Lakes' business or the business of Lower Lakes mean the combined business of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek Shipping Company, Inc. (\"Black Creek\").\nOn December 27, 2012, Lower Lakes Ship Repair Company Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes Ship Repair\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes Ship Repair provides ship repair services exclusively to the Company. On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing (17) Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes (17)\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes (17) owns the Manitoulin, a vessel placed in service in November 2015.\nOur shipping business is operated in Canada by Lower Lakes Towing and in the United States by Lower Lakes Transportation. Lower Lakes Towing was organized in March 1994 under the laws of Canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the Great Lakes. Lower Lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full-service shipping company with a combined fleet of sixteen cargo-carrying vessels operating in Canada and the United States. We have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the Great Lakes and a leading service provider in the River Class market segment. We transport construction aggregates, salt, grain, coal, iron ore and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction, electric utility, food and integrated steel industries.\nWe believe that Lower Lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port-to-port services to both Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes region. Lower Lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both U.S. and Canadian-flagged vessels in compliance with the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act in the U.S. and the Coasting Trade Act in Canada, respectively.\nLower Lakes' fleet consists of six self-unloading bulk carriers and four conventional bulk carriers in Canada and six self-unloading bulk carriers in the U.S., including three articulated tug and barge units. Lower Lakes Towing owns nine Canadian vessels and Lower Lakes (17) owns the tenth Canadian vessel. Lower Lakes Transportation time charters the six U.S. vessels, including the three tug and barge units, from Grand River. With the exception of two of the articulated tug and barge units (which Grand River bareboat charters from Black Creek), Grand River owns the vessels that it time charters to Lower Lakes Transportation.\nRecent Developments and Vessel Acquisitions\nOn March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the Lalandia Swan from Uni-Tankers M/T \"Lalandia Swan\" for a purchase price of $7.0 million. The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel. After conversion to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nOur discussion of our Results of Operations contains references to certain Non-GAAP financial measures, including, when applicable, (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease, and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles. Such measures are used internally when evaluating our operating performance and, we believe, allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that such measures, when viewed with the Company's results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period comparisons. Additionally, management believes that (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings. However, the Company's definition of such measures may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and such measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Instead, such performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided below.\nOur discussion of our Results of Operations also contains references to constant currency amounts. The constant currency information presented herein is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue from our Canadian operations has historically represented more than half of our total revenue. Consequently, our revenue has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, if the Canadian dollar weakens, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our business. The Company's definition of constant currency may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and these constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended

Depreciation, Amortization of Drydock Costs, Amortization of Intangibles, (Gain) Loss on Foreign Exchange, equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease.\nTotal revenue during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $148.4 million, a decrease of 3.0%, compared to $153.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a weaker Canadian dollar, reduction in fuel surcharges and a 195 day decrease in Sailing Days (which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing). These were partially offset by contractual price increases, higher water levels, an early time charter termination pay out, reduced delay days related to ice coverage in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and a $11.6 million increase in outside vessel charter revenue. The increase in outside vessel charter revenue relates to a single large customer that experienced liquidity issues in the third fiscal quarter, which caused the customer to defer inventory replenishment, which created inefficient trade pattern density for us. In addition, this same customer entered litigation with one of its suppliers, which resulted in their finding an alternative supply chain solution including loading ports which were not in locations that we could economically service. The customer filed for creditors protection under the Company's Creditors Arrangement Act (CCA) in November 2015. Subsequent to the filing, to address their depleted on-hand raw material inventory and meet their winter needs before the end of the sailing season, they compressed a dramatic amount of deliveries into a 60 day window. The combination of these factors resulted in our inability to provide adequate internal vessel capacity or trade pattern flexibility to meet their revised replenishment needs. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue increased 6.6%, or $10.0 million, during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nFreight and other related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels decreased $5.5 million, or 4.3%, to $123.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $129.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. The decline was primarily a result of the aforementioned customer's CCA filing and related change in supply chain, a 195 day decrease in Sailing Days and a weaker Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, freight and other related revenue increased 3.7%, or $4.7 million, during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nTotal tons hauled during the year ended March 31, 2016, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment, increased by 5.3% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Our tonnage carried on vessels that we operated during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased 2.3% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 we experienced increases in tonnage carried in construction aggregates of 12.9% due to stronger housing demand in the U.S.\nmarket. Our salt tonnage, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment increased 10.2% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Total iron ore tons carried, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment, increased by 4.3% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year March 31, 2015 . Iron ore tons carried on vessels that we operated, decreased by 14.1% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 due to the aforementioned liquidity and subsequent CCA filing of a major customer in the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. Coal tonnage hauled in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 decreased 15.2% compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, including tonnage carried on outside voyage charter equipment vessel, due to weaker demand.\nWe introduced our sixteenth vessel into service on November 22, 2015 and operated fifteen other vessels (the Operated Vessels\u201d) during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to operating fifteen vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015. We operated a total of 3,911 Sailing Days in the year ended March 31, 2016, including 113 Sailing Days in our fiscal fourth quarter compared to 4,106 Sailing Days in the prior year, including 256 Sailing Days in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Management believes that each of our Operated Vessels should achieve a theoretical maximum of 275 Sailing Days in the sailing season, assuming average weather conditions, no major repairs, incidents or vessel layups. With the exception of the vessel we introduced into service on November 22, 2015, the Company's Operated Vessels sailed an average of approximately 241 Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to an average of 274 Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Our Operated Vessels exclusive of our newly introduced vessel operated for 93.4% of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, compared to 99.5% of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Approximately 63 of the lost Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were associated with vessels that we were operating under time charter agreements. Time charter agreements allow our customers the certainty of vessel capacity and in return the chartering customer continues to pay a reduced daily charter rate if the vessel does not sail. We were unable to economically use the remaining lost Sailing Days to haul tonnage for the aforementioned customer who filed for CCA protection.\nWe also measure \"Delay Days\", which we define as the lost time incurred by our vessels while in operation, and includes delays caused by inclement weather, dock delays, traffic congestion, vessel mechanical issues and other varied events. We experienced 343 Delay Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 434 Delay Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Such Delay Days represent a Lost Time Factor, calculated as Delay Days as a percentage of Sailing Days, of 8.8% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 10.6% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nFreight and related revenue per Sailing Day increased $158, or 0.5%, to $31,601 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $31,443 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This revenue increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of cargos carried, fewer delay days and a trade pattern, offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, freight and related revenue per Sailing Day increased 8.8% or $2,782 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby changes in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers. Fuel and other surcharges decreased $10.6 million, or 47.8%, to $11.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $22.1 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Fuel and other surcharges per Sailing Day decreased by $2,433, or 45.2%, to $2,952 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $5,385 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. These decreases were primarily attributable to reduced fuel prices and a weaker Canadian dollar during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. On a constant currency basis, fuel and other surcharges decreased 39.0%, or $8.6 million, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nVessel operating expenses decreased $14.5 million, or 14.8%, to $83.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $97.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a weaker Canadian dollar, reduced Sailing Days and reduced fuel prices, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Vessel operating expenses per Sailing Day decreased $2,509, or 10.5%, to $21,315 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 from $23,824 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. On a constant currency basis, vessel operating expenses decreased 6.8%, or $6.7 million, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nRepairs and maintenance expenses, which primarily consist of expensed winter work, decreased $0.6 million to $5.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to a weaker Canadian dollar . Repairs and maintenance per Sailing Day decreased $78 to $1,496 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis,\nrepairs and maintenance expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur general and administrative expenses were $13.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $13.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We incurred a non-recurring expense of $0.6 million associated with accelerated vesting of equity-based severance costs for two executives. Excluding this one-time charge, compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly, but were offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. Our general and administrative expenses before the one-time charge equaled 10.8% and 10.3% of freight and related revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation expense was $18.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and $18.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This increase of $0.6 million was primarily attributable to winter 2015 capital expenditures and depreciation attributable to our newest vessel offset by a weaker Canadian dollar.\nAmortization of drydock costs was $3.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and $3.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. During each of these periods, the Company amortized the deferred drydock costs of thirteen of its vessels.\nGain on foreign exchange during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $0.1 million, as compared to a loss of $0.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Gain or loss on foreign exchange primarily relates to a translation of $39.8 million USD denominated debt incurred and carried on the balance sheet of the Canadian subsidiary offset by a foreign currency hedge.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we incurred a $2.7 million loss on termination of a vessel lease.\nAs a result of the items described above, operating income during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 was $8.4 million compared to $7.3 million during the three month period ended March 31, 2015.\nOperating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, one-time equity based severance costs, and loss on termination of vessel lease decreased $1.3 million, or 3.7%, from $33.7 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 to $32.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis, operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, one-time equity based severance costs, and loss on termination of vessel lease increased 4.2%, or $1.4 million, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, which is net of $1.2 million of capitalized interest and includes $1.3 million of amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $1.5 million or 11.0% to $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 from $14.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a lower interest rate on a portion of our long-term debt as a result of our refinancing completed in March 2015, a weaker Canadian dollar and higher interest capitalization, partially offset by a higher average debt balance compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Cash interest expense during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 equaled $12.3 million compared to $12.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur loss before income taxes was $4.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $9.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was (5.8)% on pre-tax loss of $4.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $0.2 million. None of our U.S. federal income tax expense is payable in cash due to our net operating loss carry-forwards (\"NOL\"). However, foreign and state income tax expense in the amount of $.04 million for Corporate Minimum Tax is payable in cash. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was (4.7)% on pre-tax loss of $9.0 resulting in an income tax expense of $0.4 million.\nOur current effective tax expense is primarily driven by the change in the valuation allowance against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 we established a $4.1 million reserve or valuation against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, our reserve has continued to increase to $7.8 million.\nOur U.S. NOL was $60.5 million as of March 31, 2016. As it relates to the $7.8 million valuation allowance against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets, the Company is required to establish a valuation allowance when future deductibility is uncertain.\nOur provision for income tax expense was $0.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $0.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in income tax expense was due to a lower net loss before income taxes coupled with a lower consolidated tax rate during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur net loss before preferred stock dividends was $4.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to net loss before preferred stock dividends of $9.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nWe accrued $1.3 million for dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is attributable to a 1% increase in the effective rate of preferred dividends partially offset by a the conversion of a small number of preferred shares to common shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.\nOur income applicable to common stockholders was a loss of $5.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to a loss of $10.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nThe Canadian dollar (CDN) weakened by 13.2% compared to the U.S. dollar (USD) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, averaging approximately $0.764 USD per CDN during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to approximately $0.880 USD per CDN during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The Company's balance sheet translation rate decreased from $0.790 USD per CDN at March 31, 2015 to $0.770 USD per CDN at March 31, 2016.\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, the Company operated an average of six vessels in the U.S. and nine vessels in Canada. The percentage of our total freight and other revenue, fuel and other surcharge revenue, vessel operating expenses, repairs and maintenance costs and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessels operated by country. Approximately half of our general and administrative costs and our interest expense is incurred in Canada. Approximately 40% of our interest expense is incurred in Canada, reflecting the approximate percentage of total debt. All of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the U.S.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs. However, our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges. In addition, there was volatility in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, which impacted the average of monthly translation rates for total revenue and costs to U.S. dollars by a decrease of approximately 13.2% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, the proceeds of our credit facilities and proceeds from sales of our common stock. In March 2015, the Company refinanced its senior secured debt as discussed below. Our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions, capital expenditures, drydock expenditures, operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facilities. Information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (categorized by operating, investing and financing activities), which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015. We believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowings under our credit facilities will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months. However, if the Company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the Company's customers materially delay their receivable payments, the Company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity. The Company has maintained its focus on productivity gains and cost controls, and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances.\nNet cash generated by operating activities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $23.2 million, a decrease of $3.9 million, from $27.1 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in cash generated was primarily attributable to higher unrealized foreign exchange loss in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and reduced cash flow from working capital changes in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.\nThe Company did not incur any significant bad-debt write-offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during either of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.\nNet cash used in investing activities increased by $21.4 million to $45.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 from net cash used of $23.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to capital expenditures on the conversion of our newest vessel to a self-unloading vessel.\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $20.4 million to $18.9 million provided during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to net cash used of $1.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to borrowings under our senior and subordinated credit facilities related to the payments for our vessel conversion project.\nDebt\nWe had total debt outstanding of $192.6 million at March 31, 2016 which is comprised of amounts outstanding under our First Lien Credit Agreement (defined below) of $114.5 million and our Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement (defined below) of $78.1 million.\nFirst Lien Credit Agreement\nOn March 27, 2015, Rand and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the First Lien Credit Agreement\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as agent and lender, and certain other lenders party thereto. Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, and Black Creek are borrowers (the Borrowers\u201d) under the First Lien Credit Agreement. Black Creek, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River, Black Creek Holdings, Rand LL Holdings Corp. and Rand Finance Corp., each of which is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Rand and Rand itself are guarantors of all United States and Canadian obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement (collectively, the U.S. Guarantors\u201d). Lower Lakes Towing (17) and Lower Lakes Ship Repair are guarantors of all Canadian obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement and are direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Rand (collectively, the Canadian Guarantors\u201d; and together with the U.S. Guarantors, the Guarantors\u201d). The proceeds of the First Lien Credit Agreement were used to extinguish certain then existing indebtedness and to provide working capital financing and funds for other general corporate and permitted purposes.\nThe obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are secured by first-priority liens on, and a first-priority security interest in, substantially all of the assets of the Borrowers and the Guarantors party to the agreement. The security interests are evidenced by pledge, security and guaranty agreements and other related agreements, including certain fleet mortgages.\nThe credit facilities (the \"Credit Facilities\") under First Lien Credit Agreement consist of:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A revolving credit facility under which Lower Lakes Towing may borrow up to US $80 million (CDN or USD currency to be selected by Lower Lakes Towing) with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the \"Canadian Revolving Facility\");\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A revolving credit facility under which Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek may borrow up to USD $90 million with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the \"U.S. Revolving Facility\");\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A swing line facility under which Lower Lakes Towing may borrow up to CDN $8 million, less the outstanding balance of the Canadian Revolving Facility, with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the \"Canadian Swing Line Facility\"); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A swing line facility under which Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek may borrow up to USD $9 million, less the outstanding balance of the U.S. Revolving Facility, with a final maturity date of September 30, 2019 (the \"U.S. Swing Line Facility\").\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities will bear interest, in each case plus an applicable margin, as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Canadian Revolving Facility: if funded in Canadian Dollars, the BA Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement)or, at the borrower's option, the Canadian Prime Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) and if funded in U.S. Dollars, the Canadian Base Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) or, at the borrower's option, the LIBOR Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. Revolving Facility: the U.S. Base Rate (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement) or, at the borrower's option, the LIBOR Rate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Canadian Swing Line Facility: the Canadian Prime Rate or, at the borrower's option, the Canadian Base Rate; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>U.S. Swing Line Facility: the U.S. Base Rate.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe applicable margin to the BA Rate, Canadian Prime Rate, Canadian Base Rate, U.S. Base Rate and the LIBOR Rate is subject to specified changes depending on the Senior Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio (as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement). The Borrowers will also pay a monthly commitment fee at an annual rate of 0.25% on the undrawn committed amount available under the Canadian Revolving Facility and the U.S. Revolving Facility (the Revolving Facilities\u201d), which rate shall increase to 0.375% in the event the undrawn committed amount is greater than or equal to 50% of the aggregate committed amount under the Revolving Facilities.\nAny amounts outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement are due at maturity. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, the Borrowers will be required to make principal repayments on amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities from the net proceeds of specified types of asset sales, debt issuances and equity offerings. No such transactions have occurred as of March 31, 2016.\nThe First Lien Credit Agreement contains certain negative covenants, including those limiting the guarantors', the borrowers', and their subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the nature of their businesses, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments or pay dividends. In addition, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2015, Rand was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the First Lien Credit Agreement. On February 9, 2016, Rand and the lenders entered into an Amendment No. 1 and Waiver Agreement pursuant to which certain covenant breaches were waived by the lenders. As of March 31, 2016, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement was $114.5 million and Rand Company was otherwise in compliance with the covenants set forth in the First Lien Credit Agreement.\nAmended Second Lien Credit Agreement\nOn March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing, Grand River and Black Creek, as borrowers, Rand LL Holdings, Rand Finance, Black Creek Holdings and Rand, as guarantors, Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC, as agent and Lender, and certain other lenders, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (as amended on April 11, 2014 and March 27, 2015, the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement\u201d). The Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement initially provided for (i) a U.S. Dollar denominated term loan facility under which Lower Lakes Towing is obligated to the lenders in the amount of $34.2 million (the \"Second Lien CDN Term Loan\"); (ii) a U.S. dollar denominated term loan facility under which Grand River and Black Creek are obligated to the lenders in the amount of $38.3 million (the \"Second Lien U.S. Term Loan\"); and (iii) an uncommitted incremental term loan facility of up to $22.5 million as of March 27, 2015.\nThe outstanding principal amount of the Second Lien CDN Term Loan borrowings and the Second Lien U.S. Term Loan borrowings will be repayable upon their maturity on March 11, 2020. The Second Lien CDN Term Loan and Second Lien U.S. Term Loan bear an interest rate per annum at borrowers' option, equal to (i) LIBOR (as defined in the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement) plus 9.50% per annum, or (ii) the U.S. Base Rate (as defined in the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement), plus 8.50% per annum.\nThe effective interest rates at March 31, 2016 were 10.75% (10.75% at March 31, 2015) on the Second Lien CDN Term Loan and 10.75% (10.75% at March 31, 2015) on the Second Lien U.S. Term Loan.\nObligations under the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement are secured by the first-priority liens and security interests in substantially all of the assets of the borrowers and the guarantors, including a pledge of all or a portion of the equity interests of the borrowers and the guarantors. The indebtedness of each domestic borrower under the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement is unconditionally guaranteed by each other domestic borrower and by the guarantors which are domestic subsidiaries, and such guaranty is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of each borrower and each guarantor. Each domestic borrower also guarantees the obligations of the Canadian borrower and each Canadian guarantor guarantees the obligations of the Canadian borrower.\nUnder the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below), the borrowers will be required to make mandatory prepayments of principal on term loan borrowings (i) in the event of certain dispositions of assets and insurance proceeds (all subject to certain exceptions), in an amount equal to 100% of the net\nproceeds received by the borrowers therefrom, and (ii) in an amount equal to 100% of the net proceeds to a borrower from any issuance of a borrower's debt or equity securities (all subject to certain exceptions).\nThe Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement contains certain covenants, including those limiting the guarantors, the borrowers, and their subsidiaries' ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, sell or acquire assets or businesses, change the nature of their businesses, engage in transactions with related parties, make certain investments or pay dividends. In addition, the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement requires the borrowers to maintain certain financial ratios. As of December 31, 2015, Rand was not in compliance with certain covenants contained in the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement. On February 9, 2016, Rand and the lenders entered into a Third Amendment and Waiver Under Term Loan Credit Agreement pursuant to which certain covenant breaches were waived by the lenders. As of March 31, 2016, the aggregate principal outstanding under the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement was $78.1 million and Rand was otherwise in compliance with the covenants set forth in the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement.\nThe Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement also contemplates a $5.6 million incremental loan that was required in connection with certain borrowings under the First Lien Credit Agreement towards the delivery of our new vessel at the end of 2015. This incremental loan was made on September 28, 2015.\nIntercreditor Agreement\nIn connection with the First Lien Credit Agreement and Amended Second Lien Credit agreement described above, on March 27, 2015, Rand and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an Intercreditor Agreement (the \"Intercreditor Agreement\") with Bank of America, N.A., as the agent for the lenders under the First Lien Credit Agreement (the \"First Lien Lenders\") and Guggenheim Corporate Funding, LLC, as the agent for the lenders under the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement (the \"Second Lien Lenders\"). Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Second Lien Lenders have agreed to subordinate our obligations to them to the repayment of our obligations to the First Lien Lenders and have further agreed to subordinate their liens on our assets to the liens granted in favor of the First Lien Lenders. Absent the occurrence of an Event of Default under the First Lien Credit Agreement, the Second Lien Lenders are permitted to receive regularly scheduled principal and interest payments under the Amended Second Lien Credit Agreement.\nPreferred Stock and Preferred Stock Dividends\nThe shares of the Company's series A convertible preferred stock rank senior to the Company's common stock with respect to liquidation and dividends; are entitled to receive a cash dividend at the annual rate of 7.75% (based on the $50 per share issue price), payable quarterly (subject to increases of 0.5% for each six month period in respect of which the dividend is not paid in cash, up to a maximum of 12%, subject to reversion to 7.75% upon payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends); are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at any time at the option of the series A preferred stockholder at a conversion price of $6.20 per share (based on the $50 per share issue price and subject to adjustment) or 8.065 shares of common stock for each series A preferred share (subject to adjustment); are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock (based on a conversion price of $6.20 per share, subject to adjustment) at the option of the Company if, after the third anniversary of our acquisition of Lower Lakes, the trading price of the Company's common stock for 20 trading days within any 30 trading day period equals or exceeds $8.50 per share (subject to adjustment); may be redeemed by the Company in connection with certain change of control or acquisition transactions; will vote on an as-converted basis with the Company's common stock; and have a separate vote over certain material transactions or changes involving the Company.\nAs of March 31, 2016, the Company had $1.9 million of unpaid accrued dividends on its preferred stock compared to $0.6 million at March 31, 2015. As of March 31, 2016, the effective rate of preferred dividends was 8.75% as compared to 7.75% at March 31, 2015.\nInvestments in Capital Expenditures and Drydockings\nWe incurred $46.4 million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, including $3.1 million of carryover from the 2015 winter season, compared to $25.7 million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 due to capital expenditure on our new vessel, including $4.1 million of carryover from the 2014 winter season.\nVessel Acquisition\nOn March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the Lalandia swan from Uni-Tankers M/T \"Lalandia Swan\" for a purchase price of $7.0 million. The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel. After conversion to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements.\nLack of Historical Operating Data for Acquired Vessels\nFrom time to time, as opportunities arise and depending on the availability of financing, we may acquire additional secondhand drybulk carriers.\nConsistent with shipping industry practice, other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records, we do not typically engage in historical financial due diligence process when we acquire vessels. Accordingly, in such circumstances, we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make vessel acquisitions, nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our stock in assessing our business or profitability.\nConsistent with shipping industry practice, we generally treat the acquisition of a vessel as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business. The purchase of a vessel itself typically does not transfer the contracts of affreightment serviced by such vessel because such contracts are separate service agreements between the vessel owner and its customers. In cases where a vessel services a contract of affreightment with a third party customer and the buyer desires to acquire such contract, the seller generally cannot transfer the contract to the buyer without the customer's consent.\nWhere we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel, we allocate the purchase price of acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values.\nWhen we purchase a vessel and assume or renegotiate contracts of affreightment associated with the vessel, we must take the following steps before the vessel will be ready to commence operations:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>obtain the customer's consent to us as the new owner if applicable;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>arrange for a new crew for the vessel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>replace all hired equipment on board, such as gas cylinders and communication equipment;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>negotiate and enter into new insurance contracts for the vessel through our own insurance brokers;

While all accounting policies affect the financial statements, certain policies may be viewed as critical.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the application of certain accounting policies, many of which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes. Since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty, the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates. Such differences could be material to the financial statements.\nRevenue and operating expenses recognition\nThe Company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment (voyage charters) generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin-destination and cargo carried. Voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met: the Company has a signed contract of affreightment, the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. Included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges, which represent pass-through charges to customers for toll fees, lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties. Fuel surcharges are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage, while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred. Freight surcharges are less than 5% of total revenue.\nMarine operating expenses such as crewing costs, fuel, tugs and insurance are recognized as incurred or consumed and thereby are recognized ratably in each reporting period. Repairs and maintenance and certain other insignificant costs are recognized as incurred.\nThe Company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers. Service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers. Consequently, revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above. Costs for subcontracted freight providers, presented as outside voyage charter fees\u201d in the consolidated statements of operations, are recognized as incurred and therefore are recognized ratably over the voyage.\nThe Company accounts for sales taxes imposed on its services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations. In addition, all revenues are presented on a gross basis.\nVessel acquisitions\nVessels are stated at cost, which consists of the purchase price and any material expenses incurred upon acquisition, such as initial repairs, improvements, delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage. Subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life, increase the earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels. Significant financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are also capitalized and included in the vessels' cost. Otherwise these amounts are charged to expense as incurred.\nIntangible assets and goodwill\nIntangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, financing costs, trademarks, trade names and customer relationships and contracts. Intangible Assets are amortized as follows:\nTrademarks and trade names 10 years straight-line\nCustomer relationships and contracts 15 years straight-line\nDeferred financing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related debt, which approximates the effective interest method.\nImpairment of fixed assets and finite-lived intangible assets\nFixed assets (e.g., property and equipment) and finite-lived intangible assets (e.g., customer contracts and relationships) are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event that indicates the carrying value of such an asset or asset groups (e.g., tugs and barges), might be no longer recoverable. Examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets, an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset(s), a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business, difficulties or delays in integrating the business, and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business.\nOnce a triggering event has occurred, the recoverability test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset(s) for continued use or to hold the asset(s) for sale. If the intent is to hold the asset(s) for continued use, the recoverability test involves a comparison of undiscounted cash flows excluding interest expense, against the carrying value of the asset(s) as an initial test. If the carrying value of such asset(s) exceeds the undiscounted cash flow, the asset(s) would be deemed to be impaired. Impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the fixed or amortizing intangible asset and the carrying value of such asset(s). The Company generally determines fair value by using the discounted cash flow method. If the intent is to hold the asset(s) for sale and certain other criteria are met (i.e., the asset(s) can be disposed of currently, appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and we are actively pursuing a buyer), the impairment test is a comparison of the asset's carrying value to its fair value less costs to sell. To the extent that the carrying value is greater than the asset's fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. The Company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.\nImpairment of goodwill\nThe Company annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill residing in its reporting units, to determine whether impairment may exist. GAAP requires that goodwill and certain indefinite-lived intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques. Specifically, goodwill impairment is determined using a three-step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined, based on qualitative factors, to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then entities are required to perform the next step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The estimates of fair value of the Company's two reporting units, which are the Company's Canadian and U.S. operations (excluding the parent), are determined using various valuation techniques, primarily being a discounted cash flow analysis and peer analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about future cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the Company's forecast and long-term estimates. Discount rate assumptions are\nbased on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the third step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the third step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The third step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the existing assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. As of March 31, 2016, the Company conducted the first step qualitative assessment and determined that the fair value of its two reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and the remaining two steps were therefore unnecessary. The Company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was less than the carrying value of our reporting units during the twelve month period ended March 31, 2016.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 740 Income Taxes\u201d, which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recognized, if necessary, to measure tax benefits to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that they will be realized.\nThe Company classifies interest expense related to income tax liabilities, when applicable, as part of the interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations rather than income tax expense. To date, the Company has not incurred material interest expenses or penalties relating to assessed taxation amounts.\nThe Company's primary U.S. state income tax jurisdictions are Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New York and its only international jurisdictions are Canada and its province of Ontario. The following table summarizes the open fiscal tax years for each major jurisdiction:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Jurisdiction\n</td> <td>Open Tax Years (Fiscal Years)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal (U.S.)\n</td> <td>2012 - 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Various states\n</td> <td>2012 - 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal (Canada)\n</td> <td>2009 - 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ontario\n</td> <td>2009 - 2015\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all newly granted awards and awards modified, repurchased or\ncancelled based on fair value at the date of grant.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (the \"FASB\") issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\"ASU 2014-09\"), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASU 2014-09 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 would have been effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB voted to delay the effective date of the new standard by one year to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. ASU 2014-09, as subsequently amended, shall be applied either retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting. ASU 2016-11 rescinds several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605, including, among other items, guidance relating to accounting for shipping and handling fees and freight services.The Company is evaluating the effect, if any, that adopting this new accounting standard will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nGoing Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (\"ASU 2014-15\"). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). ASU 2014-15 also provides guidance related to the required disclosures as a result of management's evaluation.\nThe amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect of this ASU will have, when adopted.\nImputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. This guidance requires that the debt issuance costs related to a recognized term debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. This amendment is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect this ASU will have, when adopted.\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires all deferred tax liabilities and assets to be presented in the balance sheet as non-current. The Company early adopted this standard on a prospective basis as of fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. As a result, the Company reclassified deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities classified as current to non-current. The prior period has not been retrospectively adjusted.\nLeases (Topic 842)\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases. This ASU revises the existing guidance related to leases by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases, as well as additional disclosure regarding leasing arrangements. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.\nCompensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including tax consequences, classification of awards, the option to recognize stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures as they occur, and the classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "The MD&A provides an overview of Rand's business, including the acquisition of Lower Lakes Towing Ltd. and its subsidiaries.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying financial statement notes of the Company appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. All dollar amounts are presented in millions except share, per share, per day and vessel amounts. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements, including as a result of the factors we describe under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors\u201d set forth in Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nBusiness\nRand was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2004 as a blank check company. In 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Lower Lakes Towing Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes Towing\") with its subsidiary Lower Lakes Transportation Company (\"Lower Lakes Transportation\") and its affiliate, Grand River Navigation Company, Inc. (\"Grand River\"). Subsequent to our acquisition of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation and Grand River, we acquired eleven additional vessels and retired three vessels.\nIn this Yearly Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to Rand, we, us and the Company include Rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and references to the Lower Lakes' business or the business of Lower Lakes mean the combined business of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek Shipping Company, Inc. (\"Black Creek\").\nOn December 27, 2012, Lower Lakes Ship Repair Company Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes Ship Repair\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes Ship Repair provides ship repair services exclusively to the Company. On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing (17) Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes (17)\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes (17) owns the Manitoulin, a vessel placed in service in November 2015.\nOur shipping business is operated in Canada by Lower Lakes Towing and in the United States by Lower Lakes Transportation. Lower Lakes Towing was organized in March 1994 under the laws of Canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the Great Lakes. Lower Lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full-service shipping company with a combined fleet of sixteen cargo-carrying vessels operating in Canada and the United States. We have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the Great Lakes and a leading service provider in the River Class market segment. We transport construction aggregates, salt, grain, coal, iron ore and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction, electric utility, food and integrated steel industries.\nWe believe that Lower Lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port-to-port services to both Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes region. Lower Lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both U.S. and Canadian-flagged vessels in compliance with the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act in the U.S. and the Coasting Trade Act in Canada, respectively.\nLower Lakes' fleet consists of six self-unloading bulk carriers and four conventional bulk carriers in Canada and six self-unloading bulk carriers in the U.S., including three articulated tug and barge units. Lower Lakes Towing owns nine Canadian vessels and Lower Lakes (17) owns the tenth Canadian vessel. Lower Lakes Transportation time charters the six U.S. vessels, including the three tug and barge units, from Grand River. With the exception of two of the articulated tug and barge units (which Grand River bareboat charters from Black Creek), Grand River owns the vessels that it time charters to Lower Lakes Transportation.\nRecent Developments and Vessel Acquisitions\nOn March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the Lalandia Swan from Uni-Tankers M/T \"Lalandia Swan\" for a purchase price of $7.0 million. The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel. After conversion to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nOur discussion of our Results of Operations contains references to certain Non-GAAP financial measures, including, when applicable, (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease, and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles. Such measures are used internally when evaluating our operating performance and, we believe, allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that such measures, when viewed with the Company's results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period comparisons. Additionally, management believes that (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings. However, the Company's definition of such measures may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and such measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Instead, such performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided below.\nOur discussion of our Results of Operations also contains references to constant currency amounts. The constant currency information presented herein is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue from our Canadian operations has historically represented more than half of our total revenue. Consequently, our revenue has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, if the Canadian dollar weakens, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our business. The Company's definition of constant currency may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and these constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015\nSelected Financial and Operating Information\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of our revenue and certain expenses during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year period ended March 31, 2015: \n*Operating Income plus Depreciation, Amortization of Drydock Costs, Amortization of Intangibles, (Gain) Loss on Foreign Exchange, equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease.\nTotal revenue during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $148.4 million, a decrease of 3.0%, compared to $153.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a weaker Canadian dollar, reduction in fuel surcharges and a 195 day decrease in Sailing Days (which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing). These were partially offset by contractual price increases, higher water levels, an early time charter termination pay out, reduced delay days related to ice coverage in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and a $11.6 million increase in outside vessel charter revenue. The increase in outside vessel charter revenue relates to a single large customer that experienced liquidity issues in the third fiscal quarter, which caused the customer to defer inventory replenishment, which created inefficient trade pattern density for us. In addition, this same customer entered litigation with one of its suppliers, which resulted in their finding an alternative supply chain solution including loading ports which were not in locations that we could economically service. The customer filed for creditors protection under the Company's Creditors Arrangement Act (CCA) in November 2015. Subsequent to the filing, to address their depleted on-hand raw material inventory and meet their winter needs before the end of the sailing season, they compressed a dramatic amount of deliveries into a 60 day window. The combination of these factors resulted in our inability to provide adequate internal vessel capacity or trade pattern flexibility to meet their revised replenishment needs. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue increased 6.6%, or $10.0 million, during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nFreight and other related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels decreased $5.5 million, or 4.3%, to $123.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $129.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. The decline was primarily a result of the aforementioned customer's CCA filing and related change in supply chain, a 195 day decrease in Sailing Days and a weaker Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, freight and other related revenue increased 3.7%, or $4.7 million, during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nTotal tons hauled during the year ended March 31, 2016, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment, increased by 5.3% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Our tonnage carried on vessels that we operated during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased 2.3% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 we experienced increases in tonnage carried in construction aggregates of 12.9% due to stronger housing demand in the U.S.\nmarket. Our salt tonnage, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment increased 10.2% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Total iron ore tons carried, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment, increased by 4.3% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year March 31, 2015 . Iron ore tons carried on vessels that we operated, decreased by 14.1% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 due to the aforementioned liquidity and subsequent CCA filing of a major customer in the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. Coal tonnage hauled in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 decreased 15.2% compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, including tonnage carried on outside voyage charter equipment vessel, due to weaker demand.\nWe introduced our sixteenth vessel into service on November 22, 2015 and operated fifteen other vessels (the Operated Vessels\u201d) during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to operating fifteen vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015. We operated a total of 3,911 Sailing Days in the year ended March 31, 2016, including 113 Sailing Days in our fiscal fourth quarter compared to 4,106 Sailing Days in the prior year, including 256 Sailing Days in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Management believes that each of our Operated Vessels should achieve a theoretical maximum of 275 Sailing Days in the sailing season, assuming average weather conditions, no major repairs, incidents or vessel layups. With the exception of the vessel we introduced into service on November 22, 2015, the Company's Operated Vessels sailed an average of approximately 241 Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to an average of 274 Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Our Operated Vessels exclusive of our newly introduced vessel operated for 93.4% of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, compared to 99.5% of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Approximately 63 of the lost Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were associated with vessels that we were operating under time charter agreements. Time charter agreements allow our customers the certainty of vessel capacity and in return the chartering customer continues to pay a reduced daily charter rate if the vessel does not sail. We were unable to economically use the remaining lost Sailing Days to haul tonnage for the aforementioned customer who filed for CCA protection.\nWe also measure \"Delay Days\", which we define as the lost time incurred by our vessels while in operation, and includes delays caused by inclement weather, dock delays, traffic congestion, vessel mechanical issues and other varied events. We experienced 343 Delay Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 434 Delay Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Such Delay Days represent a Lost Time Factor, calculated as Delay Days as a percentage of Sailing Days, of 8.8% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 10.6% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nFreight and related revenue per Sailing Day increased $158, or 0.5%, to $31,601 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $31,443 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This revenue increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of cargos carried, fewer delay days and a trade pattern, offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, freight and related revenue per Sailing Day increased 8.8% or $2,782 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby changes in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers. Fuel and other surcharges decreased $10.6 million, or 47.8%, to $11.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $22.1 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Fuel and other surcharges per Sailing Day decreased by $2,433, or 45.2%, to $2,952 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $5,385 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. These decreases were primarily attributable to reduced fuel prices and a weaker Canadian dollar during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. On a constant currency basis, fuel and other surcharges decreased 39.0%, or $8.6 million, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nVessel operating expenses decreased $14.5 million, or 14.8%, to $83.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $97.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a weaker Canadian dollar, reduced Sailing Days and reduced fuel prices, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Vessel operating expenses per Sailing Day decreased $2,509, or 10.5%, to $21,315 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 from $23,824 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. On a constant currency basis, vessel operating expenses decreased 6.8%, or $6.7 million, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nRepairs and maintenance expenses, which primarily consist of expensed winter work, decreased $0.6 million to $5.8 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 primarily due to a weaker Canadian dollar . Repairs and maintenance per Sailing Day decreased $78 to $1,496 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis,\nrepairs and maintenance expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur general and administrative expenses were $13.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $13.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We incurred a non-recurring expense of $0.6 million associated with accelerated vesting of equity-based severance costs for two executives. Excluding this one-time charge, compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly, but were offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. Our general and administrative expenses before the one-time charge equaled 10.8% and 10.3% of freight and related revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation expense was $18.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and $18.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This increase of $0.6 million was primarily attributable to winter 2015 capital expenditures and depreciation attributable to our newest vessel offset by a weaker Canadian dollar.\nAmortization of drydock costs was $3.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and $3.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. During each of these periods, the Company amortized the deferred drydock costs of thirteen of its vessels.\nGain on foreign exchange during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was $0.1 million, as compared to a loss of $0.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Gain or loss on foreign exchange primarily relates to a translation of $39.8 million USD denominated debt incurred and carried on the balance sheet of the Canadian subsidiary offset by a foreign currency hedge.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, we incurred a $2.7 million loss on termination of a vessel lease.\nAs a result of the items described above, operating income during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 was $8.4 million compared to $7.3 million during the three month period ended March 31, 2015.\nOperating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, one-time equity based severance costs, and loss on termination of vessel lease decreased $1.3 million, or 3.7%, from $33.7 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 to $32.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis, operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, (gain) loss on foreign exchange, one-time equity based severance costs, and loss on termination of vessel lease increased 4.2%, or $1.4 million, during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nInterest expense, which is net of $1.2 million of capitalized interest and includes $1.3 million of amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased by $1.5 million or 11.0% to $12.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 from $14.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a lower interest rate on a portion of our long-term debt as a result of our refinancing completed in March 2015, a weaker Canadian dollar and higher interest capitalization, partially offset by a higher average debt balance compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Cash interest expense during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 equaled $12.3 million compared to $12.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur loss before income taxes was $4.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $9.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was (5.8)% on pre-tax loss of $4.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $0.2 million. None of our U.S. federal income tax expense is payable in cash due to our net operating loss carry-forwards (\"NOL\"). However, foreign and state income tax expense in the amount of $.04 million for Corporate Minimum Tax is payable in cash. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was (4.7)% on pre-tax loss of $9.0 resulting in an income tax expense of $0.4 million.\nOur current effective tax expense is primarily driven by the change in the valuation allowance against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 we established a $4.1 million reserve or valuation against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, our reserve has continued to increase to $7.8 million.\nOur U.S. NOL was $60.5 million as of March 31, 2016. As it relates to the $7.8 million valuation allowance against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets, the Company is required to establish a valuation allowance when future deductibility is uncertain.\nOur provision for income tax expense was $0.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to an income tax expense of $0.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The decrease in income tax expense was due to a lower net loss before income taxes coupled with a lower consolidated tax rate during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur net loss before preferred stock dividends was $4.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to net loss before preferred stock dividends of $9.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nWe accrued $1.3 million for dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is attributable to a 1% increase in the effective rate of preferred dividends partially offset by a the conversion of a small number of preferred shares to common shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.\nOur income applicable to common stockholders was a loss of $5.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to a loss of $10.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nThe Canadian dollar (CDN) weakened by 13.2% compared to the U.S. dollar (USD) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, averaging approximately $0.764 USD per CDN during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to approximately $0.880 USD per CDN during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. The Company's balance sheet translation rate decreased from $0.790 USD per CDN at March 31, 2015 to $0.770 USD per CDN at March 31, 2016.\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, the Company operated an average of six vessels in the U.S. and nine vessels in Canada. The percentage of our total freight and other revenue, fuel and other surcharge revenue, vessel operating expenses, repairs and maintenance costs and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessels operated by country. Approximately half of our general and administrative costs and our interest expense is incurred in Canada. Approximately 40% of our interest expense is incurred in Canada, reflecting the approximate percentage of total debt. All of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the U.S.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs. However, our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges. In addition, there was volatility in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, which impacted the average of monthly translation rates for total revenue and costs to U.S. dollars by a decrease of approximately 13.2% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, the proceeds of our credit facilities and proceeds from sales of our common stock. In March 2015, the Company refinanced its senior secured debt as discussed below. Our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions, capital expenditures, drydock expenditures, operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facilities. Information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (categorized by operating, investing and financing activities), which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015. We believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowings under our", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying financial statement notes of the Company appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. All dollar amounts are presented in millions except share, per share, per day and vessel amounts. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates and projections about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward-looking statements, including as a result of the factors we describe under Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this annual report. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d appearing at the beginning of this report and Risk Factors\u201d set forth in Item 1A of this report.\nOverview\nBusiness\nRand was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2004 as a blank check company. In 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Lower Lakes Towing Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes Towing\") with its subsidiary Lower Lakes Transportation Company (\"Lower Lakes Transportation\") and its affiliate, Grand River Navigation Company, Inc. (\"Grand River\"). Subsequent to our acquisition of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation and Grand River, we acquired eleven additional vessels and retired three vessels.\nIn this Yearly Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to Rand, we, us and the Company include Rand and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, and references to the Lower Lakes' business or the business of Lower Lakes mean the combined business of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation, Grand River and Black Creek Shipping Company, Inc. (\"Black Creek\").\nOn December 27, 2012, Lower Lakes Ship Repair Company Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes Ship Repair\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes Ship Repair provides ship repair services exclusively to the Company. On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing (17) Ltd. (\"Lower Lakes (17)\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes (17) owns the Manitoulin, a vessel placed in service in November 2015.\nOur shipping business is operated in Canada by Lower Lakes Towing and in the United States by Lower Lakes Transportation. Lower Lakes Towing was organized in March 1994 under the laws of Canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the Great Lakes. Lower Lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full-service shipping company with a combined fleet of sixteen cargo-carrying vessels operating in Canada and the United States. We have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the Great Lakes and a leading service provider in the River Class market segment. We transport construction aggregates, salt, grain, coal, iron ore and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction, electric utility, food and integrated steel industries.\nWe believe that Lower Lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port-to-port services to both Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes region. Lower Lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both U.S. and Canadian-flagged vessels in compliance with the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act in the U.S. and the Coasting Trade Act in Canada, respectively.\nLower Lakes' fleet consists of six self-unloading bulk carriers and four conventional bulk carriers in Canada and six self-unloading bulk carriers in the U.S., including three articulated tug and barge units. Lower Lakes Towing owns nine Canadian vessels and Lower Lakes (17) owns the tenth Canadian vessel. Lower Lakes Transportation time charters the six U.S. vessels, including the three tug and barge units, from Grand River. With the exception of two of the articulated tug and barge units (which Grand River bareboat charters from Black Creek), Grand River owns the vessels that it time charters to Lower Lakes Transportation.\nRecent Developments and Vessel Acquisitions\nOn March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the Lalandia Swan from Uni-Tankers M/T \"Lalandia Swan\" for a purchase price of $7.0 million. The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel. After conversion to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nOur discussion of our Results of Operations contains references to certain Non-GAAP financial measures, including, when applicable, (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease, and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles. Such measures are used internally when evaluating our operating performance and, we believe, allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. Management believes that such measures, when viewed with the Company's results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about our operating performance and period-over-period comparisons. Additionally, management believes that (1) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs, amortization of intangibles, loss (gain) on foreign exchange, certain one-time equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease and (2) operating income plus depreciation, amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings. However, the Company's definition of such measures may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and such measures are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity. Instead, such performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures are provided below.\nOur discussion of our Results of Operations also contains references to constant currency amounts. The constant currency information presented herein is calculated by translating current period results using prior period weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. Revenue from our Canadian operations has historically represented more than half of our total revenue. Consequently, our revenue has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, if the Canadian dollar weakens, our consolidated results stated in U.S. dollars are negatively impacted. These rate fluctuations can have a significant effect on our reported results. As a supplement to our reported operating results, we present constant currency financial information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We use constant currency information to provide a framework to assess how our business performed excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. We believe this information is useful to investors to facilitate comparisons of operating results and better identify trends in our business. The Company's definition of constant currency may differ from other companies reporting similarly named measures, and these constant currency performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, or superior to, our operating performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nResults of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended

Depreciation, Amortization of Drydock Costs, Amortization of Intangibles, (Gain) Loss on Foreign Exchange, equity-based severance costs and loss on termination of vessel lease.\nTotal revenue during the year ended March 31, 2016 was $148.4 million, a decrease of 3.0%, compared to $153.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a weaker Canadian dollar, reduction in fuel surcharges and a 195 day decrease in Sailing Days (which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing). These were partially offset by contractual price increases, higher water levels, an early time charter termination pay out, reduced delay days related to ice coverage in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 and a $11.6 million increase in outside vessel charter revenue. The increase in outside vessel charter revenue relates to a single large customer that experienced liquidity issues in the third fiscal quarter, which caused the customer to defer inventory replenishment, which created inefficient trade pattern density for us. In addition, this same customer entered litigation with one of its suppliers, which resulted in their finding an alternative supply chain solution including loading ports which were not in locations that we could economically service. The customer filed for creditors protection under the Company's Creditors Arrangement Act (CCA) in November 2015. Subsequent to the filing, to address their depleted on-hand raw material inventory and meet their winter needs before the end of the sailing season, they compressed a dramatic amount of deliveries into a 60 day window. The combination of these factors resulted in our inability to provide adequate internal vessel capacity or trade pattern flexibility to meet their revised replenishment needs. On a constant currency basis, our total revenue increased 6.6%, or $10.0 million, during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nFreight and other related revenue generated from Company-operated vessels decreased $5.5 million, or 4.3%, to $123.6 million during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $129.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2015. The decline was primarily a result of the aforementioned customer's CCA filing and related change in supply chain, a 195 day decrease in Sailing Days and a weaker Canadian dollar. On a constant currency basis, freight and other related revenue increased 3.7%, or $4.7 million, during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nTotal tons hauled during the year ended March 31, 2016, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment, increased by 5.3% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Our tonnage carried on vessels that we operated during the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased 2.3% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 we experienced increases in tonnage carried in construction aggregates of 12.9% due to stronger housing demand in the U.S.\nmarket. Our salt tonnage, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment increased 10.2% compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Total iron ore tons carried, including tons carried on outside vessel charter equipment, increased by 4.3% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year March 31, 2015 . Iron ore tons carried on vessels that we operated, decreased by 14.1% in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 due to the aforementioned liquidity and subsequent CCA filing of a major customer in the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. Coal tonnage hauled in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 decreased 15.2% compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, including tonnage carried on outside voyage charter equipment vessel, due to weaker demand.\nWe introduced our sixteenth vessel into service on November 22, 2015 and operated fifteen other vessels (the Operated Vessels\u201d) during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to operating fifteen vessels during the year ended March 31, 2015. We operated a total of 3,911 Sailing Days in the year ended March 31, 2016, including 113 Sailing Days in our fiscal fourth quarter compared to 4,106 Sailing Days in the prior year, including 256 Sailing Days in the quarter ended March 31, 2015. Management believes that each of our Operated Vessels should achieve a theoretical maximum of 275 Sailing Days in the sailing season, assuming average weather conditions, no major repairs, incidents or vessel layups. With the exception of the vessel we introduced into service on November 22, 2015, the Company's Operated Vessels sailed an average of approximately 241 Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to an average of 274 Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Our Operated Vessels exclusive of our newly introduced vessel operated for 93.4% of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, compared to 99.5% of the theoretical maximum Sailing Days for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Approximately 63 of the lost Sailing Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were associated with vessels that we were operating under time charter agreements. Time charter agreements allow our customers the certainty of vessel capacity and in return the chartering customer continues to pay a reduced daily charter rate if the vessel does not sail. We were unable to economically use the remaining lost Sailing Days to haul tonnage for the aforementioned customer who filed for CCA protection.\nWe also measure \"Delay Days\", which we define as the lost time incurred by our vessels while in operation, and includes delays caused by inclement weather, dock delays, traffic congestion, vessel mechanical issues and other varied events. We experienced 343 Delay Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 434 Delay Days during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Such Delay Days represent a Lost Time Factor, calculated as Delay Days as a percentage of Sailing Days, of 8.8% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to 10.6% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nFreight and related revenue per Sailing Day increased $158, or 0.5%, to $31,601 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $31,443 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This revenue increase was primarily due to a change in the mix of cargos carried, fewer delay days and a trade pattern, offset by a weaker Canadian dollar.

Fuel and other surcharges decreased $10.6 million, or 47.8%, to $11.5 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $22.1 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.

Repairs and maintenance per Sailing Day decreased $78 to $1,496 per Sailing Day during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. On a constant currency basis,\nrepairs and maintenance expenses decreased $0.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur general and administrative expenses were $13.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $13.3 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. We incurred a non-recurring expense of $0.6 million associated with accelerated vesting of equity-based severance costs for two executives. Excluding this one-time charge, compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly, but were offset by a weaker Canadian dollar. Our general and administrative expenses before the one-time charge equaled 10.8% and 10.3% of freight and related revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, respectively.\nDepreciation expense was $18.9 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and $18.3 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.

This decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a lower interest rate on a portion of our long-term debt as a result of our refinancing completed in March 2015, a weaker Canadian dollar and higher interest capitalization, partially offset by a higher average debt balance compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Cash interest expense during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 equaled $12.3 million compared to $12.9 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur loss before income taxes was $4.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $9.0 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was (5.8)% on pre-tax loss of $4.0 million resulting in an income tax expense of $0.2 million. None of our U.S. federal income tax expense is payable in cash due to our net operating loss carry-forwards (\"NOL\"). However, foreign and state income tax expense in the amount of $.04 million for Corporate Minimum Tax is payable in cash. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was (4.7)% on pre-tax loss of $9.0 resulting in an income tax expense of $0.4 million.\nOur current effective tax expense is primarily driven by the change in the valuation allowance against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. In fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 we established a $4.1 million reserve or valuation against our U.S. federal net deferred tax assets. As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, our reserve has continued to increase to $7.8 million.\nOur U.S. NOL was $60.5 million as of March 31, 2016.

The decrease in income tax expense was due to a lower net loss before income taxes coupled with a lower consolidated tax rate during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nOur net loss before preferred stock dividends was $4.2 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to net loss before preferred stock dividends of $9.4 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nWe accrued $1.3 million for dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $1.2 million for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. This increase is attributable to a 1% increase in the effective rate of preferred dividends partially offset by a the conversion of a small number of preferred shares to common shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.\nOur income applicable to common stockholders was a loss of $5.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to a loss of $10.6 million during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nThe Canadian dollar (CDN) weakened by 13.2% compared to the U.S. dollar (USD) during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 as compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, averaging approximately $0.764 USD per CDN during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to approximately $0.880 USD per CDN during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.

The percentage of our total freight and other revenue, fuel and other surcharge revenue, vessel operating expenses, repairs and maintenance costs and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessels operated by country. Approximately half of our general and administrative costs and our interest expense is incurred in Canada. Approximately 40% of our interest expense is incurred in Canada, reflecting the approximate percentage of total debt. All of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the U.S.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nDuring the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs. However, our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges. In addition, there was volatility in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, which impacted the average of monthly translation rates for total revenue and costs to U.S. dollars by a decrease of approximately 13.2% during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, the proceeds of our credit facilities and proceeds from sales of our common stock. In March 2015, the Company refinanced its senior secured debt as discussed below. Our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions, capital expenditures, drydock expenditures, operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facilities. Information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows (categorized by operating, investing and financing activities), which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015.
