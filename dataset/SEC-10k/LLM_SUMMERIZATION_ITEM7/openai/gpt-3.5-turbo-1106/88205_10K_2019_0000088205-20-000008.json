Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Item 7 pertain to continuing operations only.\nExecutive Overview\nRevenues for 2019 totaled $1,525.4, compared to $1,538.6 in 2018 (and $1,425.8 in 2017). The decrease in revenues in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a decline in organic revenue, (ii) adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2019 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and $6.0, respectively, and (iii) a stronger U.S. dollar during 2019, partially offset by increases in revenues associated with the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues in 2018 and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the Heat Transfer business as a result of its wind-down activities, partially offset by increases in organic revenue for all three of our reportable segments. The increase in revenues in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to (i) the impact of the Schonstedt and Cues acquisitions, (ii) the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 (see below for additional details), and (iii) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 during 2017 resulting from revisions to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa. Organic revenue was generally flat in 2018 compared to the prior year.\nFor 2019, operating income totaled $107.9, compared to $107.6 in 2018 (and $59.9 in 2017). The increase in operating income in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to improved operating results across all three reportable segments, partially offset by increased losses associated with the large power projects in South Africa, with such losses impacted by reductions in revenues/profits of $17.5 and $6.0 during the first and second quarters of 2019, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to an increase in profits within our HVAC reportable segment associated with organic revenue growth during the year. In addition, operating income for 2017 was impacted by (i) a reduction in profit of $52.8 associated with revisions to expected revenues and profits on the large power projects in South Africa and (ii) a gain of $10.2 on a contract settlement within our Heat Transfer business.\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations totaled $152.9 in 2019, compared to $112.9 in 2018 (and $53.5 in 2017). The increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations, compared to 2018, was due primarily to reductions in working capital at certain of our businesses and a decline in cash outflows related to the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019. These improvements in operating cash flows were offset partially by a decline in net income tax refunds (net tax payments of $7.0 in 2019 versus net tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018). The increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily the result of net income tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018 (versus net income tax payments of $22.9 in 2017).\nAdditional details on certain matters noted above as well as significant items impacting the financial results for 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows:\n2019:\n\u2022On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sabik:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Sabik was $77.2, net of cash acquired of $0.6.\n\u25e6Sabik's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $28.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Sabik are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u2022On March 14, 2019, as part of the business's wind-down activities, we completed the sale of Heat Transfer's manufacturing facility:\n\u25e6Cash proceeds from the sale totaled $5.5.\n\u25e6The sale resulted in a gain of $0.3, which is recorded within Other expense, net.\u201d\n\u2022Adjustments to Revenues and Profits on the Large Power Projects in South Africa:\n\u25e6During the first quarter of 2019, in consideration of recent claims received from the prime contractors on the projects, and in accordance with ASC 606, we analyzed the risk of a significant revenue reversal associated with the amount of variable consideration recorded for the projects. Based on such analysis, we reduced the amount of cumulative revenue associated with the variable consideration on the projects by $17.5.\n\u25e6On June 28, 2019, DBT reached an agreement with Alstom/GE, one of the prime contractors on the projects, to, among other things, settle all material outstanding claims between the parties (other than certain pass-through\nclaims related to third-parties). In connection with the agreement, we reduced the revenues associated with the projects by $6.0 during the second quarter of 2019.\n\u25e6See Notes 5 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On July 3, 2019, we completed the acquisition of SGS:\n\u25e6The purchase price for SGS was $10.0, plus a deferred payment not to exceed $1.5.\n\u25e6SGS's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $12.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of SGS are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.\n\u2022On November 12, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Patterson-Kelley:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Patterson-Kelley was $59.9.\n\u25e6Patterson-Kelley's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $35.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Patterson-Kelley are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.\n\u2022On December 17, 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement:\n\u25e6In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.6 associated with the write-off of a portion of deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement.\n\u25e6See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded net actuarial losses of $10.0 in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Changes in the Estimated Fair Value of an Equity Security:\n\u25e6During 2019, we recorded gains of $7.9 within Other expense, net\u201d related to increases in the estimated fair value of an equity security that we hold.\n\u25e6See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additions details.\n2018:\n\u2022Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new standard on revenue recognition ( ASC 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective transition approach:\n\u25e6The most significant effect of adopting ASC 606 was on our power transformer business.\n\u25e6The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase in revenues of $14.2 and an increase in operating income of $2.0 during 2018 as compared to the amounts that would have been recorded under the prior revenue recognition standard.\n\u25e6See Notes 1, 3, and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Schonstedt:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Schonstedt was $16.4, net of cash acquired of $0.3.\n\u25e6Schonstedt's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $9.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Schonstedt are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u2022On March 8, 2018, we settled our then-existing interest rate swap agreement ( Old Swaps\u201d) and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement ( New Swaps\u201d).\n\u25e6Old Swaps\n\u25aaWe discontinued hedge accounting for the Old Swaps in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with an amendment of our senior credit agreement.\n\u25aaDuring the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a gain of $0.6 (to Other expense, net\u201d) representing the change in fair value of the Old Swaps from January 1, 2018 through the date of settlement on March 8, 2018.\n\u25e6New Swaps\n\u25aaThe New Swaps had an initial notional amount of $260.0 and effectively convert a portion of our borrowings under our senior credit agreement to a fixed interest rate of 2.535%, plus the applicable margin.\n\u25aaWe have designated, and are accounting for, the New Swaps as cash flow hedges.\n\u25e6See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On April 30, 2018, we reached an agreement with a subsidiary of mutares AG, the acquirer of Balcke D\u00fcrr in 2016 (the Buyer\u201d), on (i) the amount of cash and working capital of Balcke D\u00fcrr at the closing date of the sale and (ii) various other matters. The settlement resulted in:\n\u25e6A net payment from the Buyer in the amount of Euro 3.0; and\n\u25e6A gain, net of tax, of $3.8, which was recorded to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d during 2018.\n\u2022On June 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Cues:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Cues was $164.4, net of cash acquired of $20.6.\n\u25e6Cues' revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $84.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Cues are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2018, as a continuation of our strategic shift away from power generation end markets, we initiated a plan to wind-down the Heat Transfer business.\n\u25e6In connection with the planned wind-down, we recorded charges of $3.5 during 2018, with $0.9 related to the write-down of inventories (included in Cost of products sold\u201d), $0.6 related to the impairment of machinery and equipment and $2.0 related to severance costs (both included in Special charges, net\u201d).\n\u25e6In addition, we sold certain intangible assets of the Heat Transfer business for net cash proceeds of $4.8, which resulted in a gain of less than $0.1 within our 2018 operating results.\n\u2022Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded net actuarial losses of $6.6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n2017:\n\u2022Income Tax Matters:\n\u25e6During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $77.6 for a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary.\n\u25e6On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted which significantly changed U.S. income tax law for businesses and individuals. As a result of the Act, we recorded provisional net income tax charges of $11.8 during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Gain from a Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately canceled by a customer. In connection with the settlement, we:\n\u25e6Received cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration; and\n\u25e6Recorded a gain of $10.2.\n\u2022On December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement:\n\u25e6In connection with the amendment, we recorded:\n\u25aaA charge of $0.9 associated with the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement; and\n\u25aaA gain of $2.7 related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing term loan.\n\u25e6See Notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Actuarial Gains and Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded:\n\u25aaAn actuarial gain during the third quarter of 2017 of $2.6 related to an amendment to our postretirement plans; and\n\u25aaNet actuarial losses of $4.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nCyclicality of End Markets, Seasonality and Competition-The financial results of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries in which they operate and end markets in which they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. For example, our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nAlthough our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, the impact accounting standard adoptions, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the first and second quarter of 2019, third quarter of 2018, and second and fourth quarter of 2017 revisions to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa, which resulted in an aggregate reduction of revenues of $23.5 in 2019, $2.7 in 2018, and $36.9 in 2017. We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue growth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, including the reconciliation of organic revenue growth (decline) to net revenue increase (decline):\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a decline in organic revenue, (ii) adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2019 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and $6.0, respectively, and (iii) a stronger U.S. dollar during 2019, partially offset by increases in revenues associated with the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues in 2018 and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the Heat Transfer business as a result of its wind-down activities, partially offset by increases in organic revenue for all three of our reportable segments. See Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\u201d for additional details.\nFor 2018, the increase in revenues, compared to 2017, was due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues during 2018. In addition, revenues were higher, when compared to 2017, due to (i) the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and (ii) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 during 2017 resulting from revisions to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. Organic revenue was generally flat in 2018 as the significant increases for the businesses within our HVAC reportable segment were offset by declines associated with (i) lower sales of process cooling products and (ii) the continued wind-down of our Heat Transfer business and our large power projects in South Africa. See \"Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\" for additional details.\nGross Profit - For 2019, the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a more profitable revenue mix and (ii) operational improvements within the cooling businesses of our HVAC reportable segment and power transformer business of our Engineered Solutions reportable segment during 2019. The more profitable revenue mix resulted from increases in revenues associated with acquired businesses that generally have higher gross margins (i.e., Cues and Sabik) and decreases in revenues for businesses that historically generate lower gross margins (i.e., DBT and Heat Transfer). In addition, for 2019, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were impacted negatively by the aggregate reduction in revenue noted above of $23.5 associated with the large power projects in South Africa.\nFor 2018, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, compared to 2017, were favorably impacted by the increase in revenues noted above. Additionally, during 2017, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted by a reduction in gross profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions to expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. Lastly, during 2018, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by (i) charges of $4.6 associated with the excess fair value (over historical cost) of inventory acquired in the Schonstedt and Cues transactions which was subsequently sold in 2018 and (ii) a decline in profitability during 2018 for our power transformer business associated primarily with a less profitable sale mix, higher commodity costs, and less favorable cost absorption.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expense - For 2019, the increase in SG&A, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the incremental SG&A associated with the acquisitions noted above.\nFor 2018, the increase in SG&A expense, compared to 2017, was primarily a result of the incremental SG&A associated with Schonstedt and Cues since their respective dates of acquisition and higher professional fees related to acquisition activities, partially offset by cost reductions associated with restructuring actions.\nIntangible Amortization - For 2019, the increase in intangible amortization, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the impact of the intangible assets acquired in the Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley transactions, and a full year of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cues transaction.\nFor 2018, the increase in intangible amortization, compared to 2018, was due to the impact of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Schonstedt and Cues transactions.\nSpecial Charges, Net - Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce, and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in 2019, 2018, and 2017.

In connection with the settlement, we recorded a gain of $10.2.\nOther Operating Expenses - During 2019, we recorded charges associated with revisions to estimates of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2016 sale of the dry cooling business, with such revisions resulting from settlement activities during the first quarter of 2019.\nOther Expense, Net - Other expense, net, for 2019 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $9.9, charges of $4.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, and foreign currency transaction losses of $1.5, partially offset by a gain of $7.9 related to changes in the estimated fair value of an equity security that we hold and income derived from company-owned life insurance policies of $4.0.\nOther expense, net, for 2018 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $3.9, charges of $5.0 associated with legacy environmental matters, and charges of $2.0 associated with asbestos product liability matters, partially offset by income of $1.5 related to the reduction of the parent company guarantees and bank surety bonds liability and the amortization of related indemnification assets that remain outstanding in connection with the Balcke D\u00fcrr sale, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $0.9, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.6.\nOther expense, net, for 2017 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $5.1, charges of $3.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $2.9, and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives of $0.6, partially offset by a gain of $2.7 associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting on our\ninterest rate swap agreements, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $1.7, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.7.\nInterest Expense, net - Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The decrease in interest expense, net, during 2019, compared to 2018, was the result of lower average debt balances during 2019.\nThe increase in interest expense, net, during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily a result of the borrowings required to finance the acquisition of Cues and a higher weighted-average interest rate during 2018 on the outstanding borrowings of our senior credit facilities.\nLoss on Amendment/Refinancing of Senior Credit Agreement - During the fourth quarter of 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.6, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we elected to reduce the issuance capacity of our foreign credit facilities under our senior credit agreement by $50.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $0.4 associated with the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the $50.0 of previously available issuance capacity.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.9, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes - During 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $13.5 on $83.2 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16.2%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2019 were (i) $1.9 of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation awards that vested and/or were exercised during the year, (ii) a $1.9 tax benefit associated with an adjustment to the taxation of foreign earnings, (iii) $1.3 of tax benefits related to our U.S. tax credits and incentives, and (iv) $1.2 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by $3.8 of tax expense related to various valuation allowance adjustments, primarily due to foreign losses generated during the period for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nDuring 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $1.4 on $79.6 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 1.8%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2018 were (i) the utilization of $33.0 of prior years' losses generated in foreign jurisdictions in which no benefit was previously recognized, (ii) $7.0 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and (iii) $2.2 of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation awards that vested during the year.\nDuring 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $47.9 on $36.1 of a pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of (132.7)%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2017 were (i) a tax benefit of $77.6 related to a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary and (ii) $4.9 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by (iii) $11.8 of net tax charges associated with the impact of the Act and (iv) $68.2 of foreign losses generated during the year for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nSale of Balcke D\u00fcrr Business\nOn December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d during 2016.\nDuring 2017, we reduced the net loss associated with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr by $6.8. The reduction was comprised of an additional income tax benefit recorded for the sale of $9.4, partially offset by the impact of adjustments to liabilities retained in connection with the sale and certain other adjustments. During the second quarter of 2018, we reached a settlement with the Buyer on the amount of cash and working capital at the closing date, as well as on various other matters, for a net payment from the Buyer in the amount of Euro 3.0. The settlement resulted in a gain, net of tax, of $3.8, which was recorded to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d during the second quarter of 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information on discontinued operations.\nOther Discontinued Operations Activity\nIn addition to Balcke D\u00fcrr, we recognized net losses of $4.4, $0.8 and $1.5 during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting from adjustments to gains/losses on dispositions of businesses discontinued prior to 2017.\nChanges in estimates associated with liabilities retained in connection with a business divestiture (e.g., income taxes) may occur. As a result, it is possible that the resulting gains/losses on these and other previous divestitures may be materially adjusted in subsequent periods.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, results of operations from our businesses reported as discontinued operations were as follows:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balcke D\u00fcrr </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (provision) benefit </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations </td> <td>(4.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.0) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (provision) benefit </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from discontinued operations, net </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations </td> <td>(4.0) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (provision) benefit </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes. These results exclude the operating results of discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of each of our reportable segments and our other operating segments.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Throughout the following discussion of reportable and other operating segments, we use organic revenue\u201d growth (decline) to facilitate explanation of the operating performance of our segments. Organic revenue growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure, and is not a substitute for net revenue growth (decline). Refer to the explanation of this measure and purpose of use by management under Results of Continuing Operations - Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nHVAC Reportable Segment\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs.\n2018% </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 vs.\n2017% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>593.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>511.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income </td> <td>95.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues </td> <td>16.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of revenue increase: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - For 2019, the increase in revenues, compared to 2018, was due to the impact of the SGS and Patterson-Kelley acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, an increase in organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar in 2019. The increase in organic revenue was due primarily to higher sales of boiler products, associated primarily with price increases, as well as cooling products in the Americas, partially offset by lower sales of cooling products in the Asia Pacific region.\nFor 2018, the increase in revenues, compared to 2017, was due to an increase in organic revenue and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The increase in organic revenue was a result of an increase in sales for all of the primary product lines within the segment.\nIncome - For 2019, the increase in income and margin, compared to 2018, was due primarily to a more profitable sale mix and operational improvements within the segment's cooling businesses.\nFor 2018, the increase in income and margin, compared to 2017, was primarily as a result of the organic revenue growth noted above.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $77.8 and $46.9 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Approximately 89% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2020.\nDetection and Measurement Reportable Segment\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs.\n2018% </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 vs.\n2017% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>384.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income </td> <td>81.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of revenue increase: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - For 2019, the increase in revenues, compared to 2018, was due to (i) the impact of the Schonstedt and Cues acquisitions in 2018 and the Sabik acquisition in 2019 and, to a lesser extent, (ii) an increase in organic revenue. The increase in organic revenue was due primarily to additional sales by the segment's communication technologies businesses, partially offset by a decline in sales by the segment's bus fare collection systems business.\nFor 2018, the increase in revenues, compared to 2017, was primarily due to the impact of the Schonstedt and Cues acquisitions, partially offset by a decline in organic revenue. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to lower sales of bus fare collection systems.\nIncome - For 2019, the increase in income, compared to 2018, was due to the impact of the acquisitions noted above and the incremental profits resulting from additional revenues within the segment's communication technologies businesses. The decrease in margin, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the incremental amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in the Cues and Sabik transactions.\nFor 2018, income increased compared to 2017, primarily as a result of the revenue increase noted above. The decrease in margin was primarily the result of (i) a charge of $4.6 associated with the excess fair value (over historical cost) of inventory acquired in the Cues and Schonstedt transactions which was subsequently sold in 2018 and (ii) the incremental amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in these transactions, partially offset by a more profitable sales mix in 2018.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $76.4 and $71.9 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Approximately 76% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2020.\nEngineered Solutions Reportable Segment\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs.\n2018% </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 vs.\n2017% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>548.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>537.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>560.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.8) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of revenue increase (decline): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adoption of ASC 606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue increase (decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues - For 2019, the increase in revenues, compared to 2018, was due to an organic revenue increase within the segment's power transformer business, partially offset by a decrease in organic revenue for the segment's process cooling business. Revenue for the segment's process cooling business continues to be impacted by a shift in its sales model, as the business is now focused more on high-margin components and services and less on lower-margin large projects.\nFor 2018, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2017, was due primarily to a decline in organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. The decline in organic revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in sales of process cooling products.\nIncome - For 2019, the increase in income and margin, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the increase in revenue noted above.\nFor 2018, the decrease in income and margin, compared to 2017, was due primarily to a decline in profitability for the segment's power transformer business associated with a less profitable sale mix, higher commodity costs, and less favorable cost absorption during 2018.\nBacklog - The segment had backlog of $373.4 and $311.2 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Approximately 91% of the segment's backlog as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2020.\nAll Other\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs.\n2018% </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 vs.\n2017% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss </td> <td>(46.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(56.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66.7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of revenue increase (decline): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organic </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(72.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>South Africa revenue revision </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue increase (decline) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________\n* Not meaningful for comparison purposes.\nRevenues - For 2019, the decrease in revenue, compared to 2018, was due primarily to a decline in organic revenue. The decline in organic revenue was the result of lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the impact of the wind-down of the Heat Transfer business. In addition, revenue in 2019 was impacted negatively by an adjustment during the first quarter of 2019 to the amount of cumulative revenue associated with the variable consideration on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and an adjustment during the second quarter of 2019 of $6.0 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa associated with a settlement with Alstom/GE.\nFor 2018, the increase in revenues, compared to 2017, was due primarily to (i) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 in 2017 related to revisions to the expected revenue and costs on our large power projects in South Africa and (ii) a weaker U.S. dollar versus the South African Rand during 2018, partially offset by a decline in organic revenue. The decline in organic revenue was the result of lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects generally were in the latter stages of completion, and (ii) the impact of the wind-down of the Heat Transfer business.\nLoss - For 2019, the increase in the loss, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the aggregate adjustments noted above to the large power projects in South Africa.\nFor 2018, the decrease in the loss, compared to 2017, was due primarily to the fact that 2017 included a charge of $52.8 associated with revisions to the expected revenues and costs of our large power projects in South Africa, partially offset by a $10.2 gain resulting from the settlement of a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately canceled by a customer of our Heat Transfer business.\nBacklog - These operating segments had aggregate backlog of $7.4 and $26.8 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Approximately 100% of the backlog as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2020.\nCorporate Expense and Other Expense\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 vs.\n2018% </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 vs.\n2017% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total consolidated revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,525.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,538.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,425.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense </td> <td>46.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of revenues </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term incentive compensation expense </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCorporate Expense - Corporate expense generally relates to the cost of our Charlotte, NC corporate headquarters. The decrease in corporate expense in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to a decline in acquisition-related costs and other professional fees, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. The increase in corporate expense in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to professional fees and other costs incurred in connection with acquisition-related activities, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation Expense - The decrease in long-term incentive compensation in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to certain one-time awards, which were issued in 2015 and became fully vested in the second half of 2018. The decrease in long-term incentive compensation expense during 2018, compared to 2017, was due to the impact of award forfeitures as a result of participant resignations during the year.\nSee Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our long-term incentive compensation plans.\nLiquidity and Financial Condition\nListed below are the cash flows from (used in) operating, investing and financing activities, and discontinued operations, as well as the net change in cash and equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Continuing operations: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities </td> <td>(153.7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(184.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from (used in) financing activities </td> <td>(11.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows from (used in) discontinued operations </td> <td>(4.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in cash and equivalents due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14.1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55.5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities, compared to 2018, was due primarily to reductions in working capital at certain of our businesses and a decline in cash outflows related to our large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019. These improvements in operating cash flows were offset partially by a decline in net income tax refunds (net tax payments of $7.0 in 2019 versus net tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018).\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities for 2019 were comprised primarily of cash utilized in the acquisitions of Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley of $147.1 and capital expenditures of $17.8, partially offset by proceeds from company-owned life insurance policies of $5.9 and proceeds of $5.5 received in connection with the sale of Heat Transfer's manufacturing facility. Cash flows used in investing activities for 2018 were comprised primarily of cash utilized in the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues of $180.8 and capital expenditures of $12.4, partially offset by net cash proceeds of $4.8 received in connection with the sale of certain intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business and cash proceeds of $4.6 received in connection with the subsequent sale of marketable securities acquired in connection with the Cues transaction.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows used in financing activities during 2019 were comprised primarily of a payment of $15.6 to settle a put option held by the minority shareholder of DBT (see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details), partially offset by net borrowings on our various debt instruments of $10.0. Cash flows from financing activities in 2018 related primarily to net borrowings in connection with the Cues acquisition.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows used in discontinued operations for 2019 related primarily to disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions. Cash flows from discontinued operations for 2018 related primarily to proceeds of $3.6 received in connection with a settlement reached with the Buyer of Balcke D\u00fcrr, partially offset by disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions.\nChange in Cash and Equivalents Due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates - Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during 2019 and 2018.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperating Activities - The increase in cash flows from operating activities, compared to 2017, was due primarily to net income tax refunds in 2018 of $44.3 (versus net income tax payments of $22.9 during 2017).\nInvesting Activities - Cash flows used in investing activities for 2018 were comprised primarily of cash utilized in the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues of $180.8 and capital expenditures of $12.4, partially offset by net cash proceeds of $4.8 received in connection with the sale of certain intangible assets of our Heat Transfer business and cash proceeds of $4.6 received in connection with the subsequent sale of marketable securities acquired in connection with the Cues transaction. Cash flows used in investing activities for 2017 were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $11.0.\nFinancing Activities - Cash flows from financing activities in 2018 primarily related to net borrowings in connection with the Cues acquisition. Cash flows used in financing activities for 2017 primarily related to financing fees of $3.6 paid in connection with the December 2017 amendment of our senior credit agreement and net repayments under our various debt instruments of $1.3.\nDiscontinued Operations - Cash flows from discontinued operations for 2018 related primarily to proceeds of $3.6 received in connection with a settlement reached with the Buyer of Balcke D\u00fcrr, partially offset by disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions.

The amendment made available a new term loan facility in the amount of $250.0, the proceeds of which were applied, together with borrowings under the domestic revolving credit facility of $86.9, to prepay the remaining balance of $336.9 under the then-existing term loan facility.\n(2)The term loan is repayable in quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2021, with the quarterly installments equal to 0.625% of the initial term loan balance of $250.0 during 2021, 1.25% in each of the four quarters of 2022 and 2023, and 1.25% during the first three quarters of 2024. The remaining balance is payable in full on December 17, 2024. Balances are net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $1.8 and $1.9 at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.\n(3)Under this arrangement, we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to $50.0, as available. At December 31, 2019, we had $36.8 of available borrowing capacity under this facility. Borrowings under this arrangement are collateralized by eligible trade receivables of certain of our businesses.\n(4)Includes balances under a purchase card program of $2.6 and $2.5 and capital lease obligations of $2.7 and $1.8 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The purchase card program allows for payment beyond the normal payment terms for goods and services acquired under the program. As this arrangement extends the payment of these purchases beyond their normal payment terms through third-party lending institutions, we have classified these amounts as short-term debt.\n(5) Other\u201d primarily includes debt assumed, foreign currency translation on any debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the term loan, and the impact of amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the term loan.\nMaturities of long-term debt payable during each of the five years subsequent to December 31, 2019 are $1.0, $7.1, $13.0, $12.8, and $218.8, respectively.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn December 17, 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) to, among other things, extend the term of each facility under the Credit Agreement (with the aggregate of each facility comprising the Senior Credit Facilities\u201d) and provide for committed senior secured financing with an aggregate amount of $800.0, consisting of the following (each with a final maturity of December 17, 2024):\n\u2022A new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $250.0 (previous aggregate principal amount of $350.0);\n\u2022A domestic revolving credit facility, available for loans and letters of credit, in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 (previously $200.0);\n\u2022A global revolving credit facility, available for loans in USD, Euros, British Pounds Sterling, and other currencies, in the aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $150.0 (previously $150.0);\n\u2022A participating foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $55.0 (previously $110.0); and\n\u2022A bilateral foreign credit instrument facility, available for performance letters of credit and guarantees, in an aggregate principal amount up to the equivalent of $45.0 (previously $40.0).\nThe above amendment to our Credit Agreement also:\n\u2022Increased the Consolidated Leverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement) that we are required to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter to not more than 3.75 to 1.00 (or up to 4.25 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters after certain permitted acquisitions);\n\u2022Reduced the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio that we are required to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter to not less than 3.00 to 1.00;

We may elect interest periods of one, two, three or six months (and, if consented to by all relevant lenders, twelve months) for Eurodollar borrowings.\nThe weighted-average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 3.3% at December 31, 2019.\nThe fees and bilateral foreign credit commitments are as specified above for foreign credit commitments unless otherwise agreed with the bilateral foreign issuing lender. We also pay fronting fees on the outstanding amounts of letters of credit and foreign credit instruments (in the participation facility) at the rates of 0.125% per annum and 0.25% per annum, respectively.\nSPX is the borrower under each of the above facilities, and certain of our foreign subsidiaries are (and we may designate other foreign subsidiaries to be) borrowers under the global revolving credit facility and the foreign credit instrument facilities. All borrowings and other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including absence of defaults and accuracy in material respects of representations and warranties.\nThe letters of credit under the domestic revolving credit facility are stand-by letters of credit requested by SPX on behalf of any of our subsidiaries or certain joint ventures. The foreign credit instrument facility is used to issue foreign credit instruments, including bank undertakings to support our foreign operations.\nThe Credit Agreement requires mandatory prepayments in amounts equal to the net proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, including from any casualty to, or governmental taking of, property in excess of specified values (other than in the ordinary course of business and subject to other exceptions) by SPX or our subsidiaries. Mandatory prepayments will be applied to repay, first, amounts outstanding under any term loans and, then, amounts (or cash collateralize letters of credit) outstanding under the global revolving credit facility and the domestic revolving credit facility (without reducing the commitments thereunder). No prepayment is required generally to the extent the net proceeds are reinvested (or committed to be reinvested) in permitted acquisitions, permitted investments or assets to be used in our business within 360 days (and if committed to be reinvested, actually reinvested within 360 days after the end of such 360-day period) of the receipt of such proceeds.\nWe may voluntarily prepay loans under the Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. Any voluntary prepayment of loans will be subject to reimbursement of the lenders' breakage costs in the case of a prepayment of Eurodollar rate borrowings other than on the last day of the relevant interest period. Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement is guaranteed by:\n\u2022Each existing and subsequently acquired or organized domestic material subsidiary with specified exceptions; and\n\u2022SPX with respect to the obligations of our foreign borrower subsidiaries under the global revolving credit facility, the participation foreign credit instrument facility and the bilateral foreign credit instrument facility.\nIndebtedness under the Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority pledge and security interest in 100% of the capital stock of our domestic subsidiaries (with certain exceptions) held by SPX or our domestic subsidiary guarantors and 65% of the capital stock of our material first-tier foreign subsidiaries (with certain exceptions). If SPX obtains a corporate credit rating from Moody's and S&P and such corporate credit rating is less than Ba2\u201d (or not rated) by Moody's and less than BB\u201d (or not rated) by S&P, then SPX and our domestic subsidiary guarantors are required to grant security interests, mortgages and other liens on substantially all of their assets. If SPX's corporate credit rating is Baa3\u201d or better by Moody's or BBB-\u201d or better by S&P and no defaults then exist, all collateral security is to be released and the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement would be unsecured.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, make investments, loans, guarantees, or advances, make restricted junior payments, including dividends, redemptions of capital stock, and voluntary prepayments or repurchase of certain other indebtedness, engage in mergers, acquisitions or sales of assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, or engage in certain transactions with affiliates, and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities. The Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default.\nWe are permitted under the Credit Agreement to repurchase our capital stock and pay cash dividends in an unlimited amount if our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is (after giving pro forma effect to such payments) less than 2.75 to 1.00. If our Consolidated Leverage Ratio is (after giving pro forma effect to such payments) greater than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00, the aggregate amount of such repurchases and dividend declarations cannot exceed (A) $100.0 in any fiscal year plus (B) an additional amount for all such repurchases and dividend declarations made after the effective date equal to the sum of (i) $100.0 plus (ii) a positive amount equal to 50% of cumulative Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Credit Agreement generally as consolidated net income subject to certain adjustments solely for the purposes of determining this basket) during the period from September 1, 2015 to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter preceding the date of such repurchase or dividend declaration for which financial statements have been (or were required to be) delivered (or, in case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit) plus (iii) certain other amounts, less our previous usage of such additional amount for certain other investments and restricted junior payments.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $292.7 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to borrowings under the domestic revolving loan facility of $140.0 and $17.3 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In\naddition, at December 31, 2019, we had $2.2 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $97.8 reserved for outstanding letters of credit.\nAt December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants of our Credit Agreement.\nOther Borrowings and Financing Activities\nCertain of our businesses purchase goods and services under a purchase card program allowing for payment beyond their normal payment terms. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the participating businesses had $2.6 and $2.5, respectively, outstanding under this arrangement.\nWe are party to a trade receivables financing agreement, whereby we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to $50.0. Availability of funds may fluctuate over time given changes in eligible receivable balances, but will not exceed the $50.0 program limit. The facility contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities customary for facilities of this type. The facility does not contain any covenants that we view as materially constraining to the activities of our business.\nIn addition, we maintain line of credit facilities in China and South Africa available to fund operations in these regions, when necessary. At December 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of borrowing capacity under these facilities was $20.0, while there were no borrowings outstanding.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe measure our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring basis, and nonfinancial assets and liabilities on a non-recurring basis, at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2) or significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nOur derivative financial assets and liabilities include interest rate swap agreements, FX forward contracts, and forward contracts that manage the exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials ( commodity contracts\u201d) that are measured at fair value using observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk, and our counterparties' credit risks. Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Based on our continued ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments active.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there was no significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk as the related instruments are collateralized under our Senior Credit Facilities. Similarly, there was no significant impact to the fair value of our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties' credit risk.\nWe primarily use the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are further discussed below.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing variable rate term loan. As a result of amending our Credit Agreement on December 19, 2017, these swaps ( Old Swaps\u201d) no longer qualified for hedge accounting, resulting in a gain (recorded to Other expense, net\u201d) in 2017 of $2.7. On March 8, 2018, we extinguished the Old Swaps and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement (the New Swaps\u201d) to hedge the interest rate risk on the variable interest rate borrowings under the Credit Agreement. The New Swaps, which we have designated and are accounting for as cash flow hedges, had an initial notional amount of $260.0 and maturities through December 2021 and effectively convert a portion of the borrowings under our Credit Agreement to a fixed rate of 2.535%, plus the applicable margin. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional amounts of the New Swaps was $247.0 and the unrealized gain (loss), net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d) was $(1.9) and $0.2 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of the New Swaps was $2.5 (long-term liability) and $0.2 (long-term asset), respectively. Changes in fair value for the New Swaps are reclassified into earnings as a component of interest expense, when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings.\nCurrency Forward Contracts\nWe manufacture and sell our products in a number of countries and, as a result, are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Our objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency-denominated cash flows\nand to minimize the impact of changes as a result of currency fluctuations. Our principal currency exposures relate to the South African Rand, British Pound Sterling, and Euro.\nFrom time to time, we enter into forward contracts to manage the exposure on contracts with forecasted transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and to manage the risk of transaction gains and losses associated with assets/liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries ( FX forward contracts\u201d). None of our FX forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.\nWe had FX forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of $26.0 and $14.4 outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with all of the $26.0 scheduled to mature in 2020.\nCommodity Contracts\nFrom time to time, we enter into commodity contracts to manage the exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials. The outstanding notional amounts of commodity contracts were 3.4 and 3.9 pounds of copper at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges and, to the extent these commodity contracts are effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted purchases, the change in fair value is included in AOCI. We reclassify AOCI associated with our commodity contracts to cost of products sold when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of these contracts was $0.4 (current asset) and $1.0 (current liability), respectively. The unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes, recorded in AOCI were $0.3 and $(0.8) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We anticipate reclassifying the unrealized gain as of December 31, 2019 to income over the next 12 months.\nOther Fair Value Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe carrying amounts of cash and equivalents and receivables reported in our consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.\nThe fair value of our debt instruments as of December 31, 2019 approximated the related carrying values due primarily to the variable market-based interest rates for such instruments.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and equivalents, trade accounts receivable, and interest rate swap, foreign currency forward, and commodity contracts. These financial instruments, other than trade accounts receivable, are placed with high-quality financial institutions throughout the world. We periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions.\nWe maintain cash levels in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced significant loss, and believe we are not exposed to significant risk of loss, in these accounts.\nWe have credit loss exposure in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the above financial instruments, but have no other off-balance-sheet credit risk of accounting loss. We anticipate, however, that counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. We do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but we do monitor the credit standing of counterparties.\nConcentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to customers in a particular industry. Credit risks are mitigated by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers' financial conditions and obtaining collateral, advance payments, or other security when appropriate. No one customer, or group of customers that to our knowledge are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for any period presented.\nCash and Other Commitments\nBalances under our Credit Agreement are payable in full on December 17, 2024. Our term loan is repayable in quarterly installments beginning in the first quarter of 2021, with the quarterly installments equal to 0.625% of the initial term loan balance of $250.0 during 2021, 1.25% in each of the four quarters of 2022 and 2023, and 1.25% during the first three quarters of 2024. The remaining balance is repayable in full on December 17, 2024.\nWe use operating leases to finance certain equipment, vehicles and properties. At December 31, 2019, we had $28.6 of future minimum rental payments under operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year.\nCapital expenditures for 2019 totaled $17.8, compared to $12.4 and $11.0 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2019 related primarily to upgrades to manufacturing facilities, including replacement of equipment. We expect 2020 capital expenditures to approximate $20.0 to $25.0, with a significant portion related to replacement of equipment.\nIn 2019, we made contributions and direct benefit payments of $15.3 to our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. We expect to make $13.9 of minimum required funding contributions and direct benefit payments in 2020. Our pension plans have not experienced any liquidity difficulties or counterparty defaults due to the volatility in the credit markets. Our pension funds earned asset returns of approximately 13.9% in 2019. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure of expected future contributions and benefit payments.\nOn a net basis, both from continuing and discontinued operations, net income tax refunds (payments) totaled ($7.0), $44.3, and $(22.9) in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. In 2019, we made payments of $9.7 associated with the actual and estimated tax liability for federal, state and foreign tax obligations and received refunds of $2.7. The amount of income taxes that we receive or pay annually is dependent on various factors, including the timing of certain deductions. Deductions and the amount of income taxes can and do vary from year to year.\nAs of December 31, 2019, except as discussed in Notes 15 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements and in the contractual obligations table below, we did not have any material guarantees, off-balance sheet arrangements or purchase commitments other than the following: (i) $17.3 of certain standby letters of credit outstanding, all of which relate to self-insurance or environmental matters and reduce the available borrowing capacity on our domestic revolving credit facility; (ii) $97.8 of letters of credit outstanding, all of which reduce the available borrowing capacity on our foreign trade facilities; and (iii) $113.7 of surety bonds.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that we indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law for any personal liability in connection with their employment or service with us, subject to limited exceptions. While we maintain insurance for this type of liability, the liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.\nWe continually review each of our businesses in order to determine their long-term strategic fit. These reviews could result in selected acquisitions to expand an existing business or result in the disposition of an existing business. In addition, you should read Risk Factors,\u201d Results for Reportable and Other Operating Segments\u201d included in this MD&A, and Business\u201d for an understanding of the risks, uncertainties and trends facing our businesses.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following is a summary of our primary contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Due\nWithin\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Due in\n1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Due in\n3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Due After\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>252.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>231.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions and payments(1)\n</td> <td>243.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase and other contractual obligations(2)\n</td> <td>90.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Future minimum operating lease payments(3)\n</td> <td>28.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments </td> <td>47.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations(4)(5)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>661.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>281.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>180.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________\n(1)Estimated minimum required pension funding and pension and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for, among other things, discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets (where applicable), and health care cost trend rates. The expected pension contributions for the U.S. plans in 2020 and thereafter reflect the minimum required contributions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008. These contributions do not reflect potential voluntary contributions, or additional contributions that may be required in connection with acquisitions, dispositions or related plan mergers. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on expected future contributions and benefit payments.\n(2)Represents contractual commitments to purchase goods and services at specified dates.\n(3)Represents rental payments under operating leases with remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year.\n(4)Contingent obligations, such as environmental accruals and those relating to uncertain tax positions generally do not have specific payment dates and accordingly have been excluded from the above table. We believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that our previously unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $5.0 to $10.0.\n(5)In addition, the above table does not include potential payments under (i) our derivative financial instruments or (ii) the guarantees and bonds associated with Balcke D\u00fcrr.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties, are listed below. This section should be read in conjunction with Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which include a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies.\nContingent Liabilities\nNumerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, claims\u201d). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers' compensation claims). Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. While we (and our subsidiaries) maintain property, cargo, auto, product, general liability, environmental, and directors' and officers' liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with acquisitions that we believe cover a significant portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., in the case of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures. Also, while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nOur recorded liabilities related to these matters totaled $592.4 (including $552.2 for asbestos product liability matters) and $631.7 (including $587.5 for asbestos product liability matters) at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The liabilities we record for these claims are based on a number of assumptions, including historical claims and payment experience and, with respect to asbestos claims, actuarial estimates of the future period during which additional claims are reasonably foreseeable. While we base our assumptions on facts currently known to us, they entail inherently subjective judgments and uncertainties. As a result, our current assumptions for estimating these liabilities may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these liabilities in the future, which could result in charges to earnings. These variances relative to current expectations could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have recorded insurance recovery assets associated with the asbestos product liability matters, with such amounts totaling $509.6 and $541.9 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These assets represent amounts that we believe we are or will be entitled to recover under agreements we have with insurance companies. The assets we record for these insurance recoveries are based on a number of assumptions, including the continued solvency of the insurers and our legal interpretation of our rights for recovery under the agreements we have with the insurers. Our current assumptions for estimating these assets may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these assets in the future. These variances relative to current expectations could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nLarge Power Projects in South Africa\nOverview - Since 2008, DBT has been executing contracts on two large power projects in South Africa (Kusile and Medupi). Over such time, the business environment surrounding these projects has been difficult, as DBT, along with many other contractors on the projects, have experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including DBT and its subcontractors), and various suppliers. DBT has substantially completed its scope of work, with its remaining responsibilities related largely to resolution of various claims, primarily between itself and one of its prime contractors, Mitsubishi-Hitachi Power Systems Africa (PTY) LTD ( MHPSA\u201d).\nThe challenges related to the projects have resulted in (i) significant adjustments to our revenue and cost estimates for the projects, (ii) DBT's submission of numerous change orders to the prime contractors, (iii) various claims and disputes between DBT and other parties involved with the projects (e.g., prime contractors, subcontractors, suppliers, etc.), and (iv) the possibility that DBT may become subject to additional claims, which could be significant. It is possible that some outstanding claims may not be resolved until after the prime contractors complete their scopes of work. Our future financial position, operating results, and cash flows could be materially impacted by the resolution of current and any future claims.\nClaims by DBT - DBT has made numerous claims against MHPSA, including claims totaling South African Rand 1,133.3 (or $80.8) that have been submitted to dispute adjudication processes as required under the relevant contracts, with such amount subject to change as DBT progresses through these processes. Certain of these processes are expected to occur in 2020. In addition to existing asserted claims, DBT may have additional claims and rights to recovery based on its remaining performance under the contracts with, and actions taken by, MHPSA. The amounts DBT may recover for current and potential future claims against MHPSA are not currently known given (i) the extent of current and potential future claims by MHPSA against DBT (see below for further discussion) and (ii) the unpredictable nature of any dispute resolution processes that may occur in connection with these current and potential future claims. No revenue has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to current or potential future claims against MHPSA.\nClaims by Prime Contractors - On February 26, 2019, DBT received notification of an interim claim consisting of both direct and consequential damages from MHPSA alleging, among other things, that DBT (i) provided defective product and (ii) failed to meet certain project milestones. We believe the notification is unsubstantiated and the vast majority of the claimed damages are prohibited under the relevant contracts. Therefore, we believe any loss for the majority of these claimed damages is remote. For the remainder of the claims, which largely appear to be direct in nature (approximately South African Rand 948.0 or $67.6), DBT has numerous defenses and, thus, we do not believe that DBT has a probable loss associated with these claims. As such, no loss has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these claims. Although it is reasonably possible that some loss may be incurred in connection with these claims, we currently are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of potential loss associated with these claims due to the (i) lack of support provided by MPHSA for these claims; (ii) complexity of contractual relationships between the end customer, MHPSA, and DBT; (iii) legal interpretation of the contract provisions and application of South African common law to the contracts; and (iv) unpredictable nature of any dispute resolution processes that may occur in connection with these claims.\nIn April and July 2019, DBT received notifications of intent to claim liquidated damages totaling South African Rand 407.2 (or $29.0) from MHPSA alleging that DBT failed to meet certain project milestones related to the construction of the filters for both the Kusile and Medupi projects. DBT has numerous defenses against these claims and, thus, we do not believe that DBT has a probable loss associated with these claims. As such, no loss has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these claims. Although it is reasonably possible that some loss may be incurred in connection with these claims, we currently are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of potential loss.\nMHPSA has made other claims against DBT totaling South African Rand 176.2 (or $12.6). DBT has numerous defenses against these claims and, thus, we do not believe that DBT has a probable loss associated with these claims. As such, no loss has been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these claims.\nIn favor of MHPSA, we have issued bonds totaling $65.1 (including $23.3 with more stringent payment terms). We believe a portion of these bonds should be reduced based on project milestones achieved by DBT. In the event that MHPSA were to receive payment on a portion, or all, of these bonds, we would be required to reimburse the bank. In addition to these bonds, SPX Corporation has guaranteed DBT's performance on these projects to the prime contractors.\nOn June 28, 2019, DBT reached an agreement with Alstom/GE, the other prime contractor on the projects, to, among other things, settle all material outstanding claims between the parties (other than certain pass-through claims relating to third parties), including a liquidated damages claim made by Alstom/GE. In connection with the agreement, we reduced revenues (and operating income) by $6.0 during the second quarter of 2019.\nClaims by Subcontractor - On October 30, 2018, a non-governmental business adjudicator in South Africa provided a decision on certain claims made against DBT by one of its subcontractors. As part of its decision, the adjudicator concluded that the subcontractor was entitled to payment of South African Rand 256.0 (or $18.2). We believed that the decision was invalid on numerous bases and, thus, we did not record a loss in our accompanying consolidated financial statements as a result of the adjudicator's decision. The matter was referred to an arbitration tribunal and, on January 16, 2020, the arbitration tribunal ruled that the subcontractor was only entitled to a payment of South African Rand 19.4 (or $1.4). The arbitration tribunal's ruling is binding on both DBT and the subcontractor. We have reflected the liability for such amount within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nNoncontrolling Interest in South African Subsidiary\nDBT had a Black Economic Empowerment shareholder (the BEE Partner\u201d) that held a 25.1% noncontrolling interest in DBT. Under the terms of the shareholder agreement between the BEE Partner and SPX Technologies (PTY) LTD ( SPX Technologies\u201d), the BEE Partner had the option to put its ownership interest in DBT to SPX Technologies, the majority shareholder of DBT, at a redemption amount determined in accordance with the terms of the shareholder agreement (the Put Option\u201d). The BEE Partner notified SPX Technologies of its intention to exercise the Put Option and, on July 6, 2016, an\narbitration tribunal declared that the BEE Partner was entitled to South African Rand 287.3 in connection with the exercise of the Put Option, having not considered an amount due from the BEE Partner under a promissory note of South African Rand 30.3 held by SPX Technologies. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, we reflected the net redemption amount of South African Rand 257.0 (or $17.7 at December 31, 2018) within Accrued expenses\u201d on our consolidated balance sheet, with the related offset recorded to Paid-in capital\u201d and Accumulated other comprehensive income.\u201d\nIn August 2016, SPX Technologies applied to the High Court of South Africa (the High Court\u201d) to have the arbitration tribunal's ruling set aside. On January 22, 2018, the High Court ruled in SPX Technologies' favor and set aside the arbitration tribunal's ruling. The BEE Partner subsequently applied to the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa (the SCA\u201d) to have the arbitration tribunal's ruling upheld. On September 6, 2019, the SCA ruled in favor of the BEE Partner. On October 16, 2019, SPX Technologies, DBT, and SPX Corporation executed an agreement with the BEE Partner and its affiliates to settle the Put Option and all other claims between the parties for a total payment of South African Rand 230.0 (or $15.6), which was paid in full on October 21, 2019. The difference between the settlement amount (South African Rand 230.0) and the amount previously recorded of South African Rand 257.0 (see above), or South African Rand 27.0 (or $1.8), along with a tax benefit of $3.8 associated with the total payment of South African Rand 230.0, have been reflected as an adjustment to Net income attributable to SPX common shareholders\u201d in our calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019, with such adjustment totaling $5.6.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements. We are currently involved in various investigatory and remedial actions at our facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. It is our policy to accrue for estimated losses from legal actions or claims when events exist that make the realization of the losses or expenses probable and they can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs, including investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance of clean-up sites. Accordingly, our estimates may change based on future developments, including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies, differences in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided, future findings of investigation or remediation actions, or alteration to the expected remediation plans. We expense costs incurred to investigate and remediate environmental issues unless they extend the economic useful lives of related assets. We record liabilities when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants, regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties. It is our policy to realize a change in estimates once it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. In determining our accruals, we generally do not discount environmental accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance, litigation and other recoveries. We take into account third-party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification.\nSelf-Insured Risk Management Matters\nWe are self-insured for certain of our workers' compensation, automobile, product and general liability, disability and health costs, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. Our accruals for risk management matters are determined by us, are based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported, and generally are not discounted. We consider a number of factors, including third-party actuarial valuations, when making these determinations. We maintain third-party stop-loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts; however, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures. The key assumptions considered in estimating the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and the estimated costs associated with incurred but not yet reported claims include, among other things, our historical and industry claims experience, trends in health care and administrative costs, our current and future risk management programs, and historical lag studies with regard to the timing between when a claim is incurred versus when it is reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs previously indicated, effective January 1, 2018, we adopted, under the modified retrospective transition approach, a new standard on revenue recognition that outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. This guidance requires revenue to be recognized over-time or at a point in time.\nMost of our businesses recognize revenue at a point in time as satisfaction of the related performance obligations occur at the time of shipment or delivery, while certain of our businesses recognize revenue and costs for long-term contracts over-time (in 2019 and 2018) or, under the previous revenue recognition guidance, utilizing the percentage-of-completion method (prior to 2018).\nThe revenue for these long-term contracts is recorded based on the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such a contract at completion. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized $523.7, $582.6 and $255.5, respectively, of revenues under such methods. We record any provision for estimated losses on uncompleted long-term contracts in the period which the losses are determined.\nOur long-term contracts often include unapproved change orders and claims. We include in our contract estimates additional revenue for unapproved change orders or claims when we believe we have an enforceable right to the unapproved change order or claim and the amount can be reliably estimated. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim, the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs, and the objective evidence available to support the claim. These estimates are also based on historical award experience. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate revenues and completion costs on our long-term contracts, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised during the duration of the contract. These revised revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined.\nOur estimation process for determining revenues and costs for our long-term contracts is based upon (i) our historical experience, (ii) the professional judgment and knowledge of our engineers, project managers, and operations and financial professionals, and (iii) an assessment of the key underlying factors (see below).\nAs our long-term contracts generally range from six to eighteen months in duration, we typically reassess the estimated revenues and costs of these contracts on a quarterly basis, but may reassess more often as situations warrant. We record changes in estimates of revenues and costs when identified using the cumulative catch-up method prescribed by the applicable revenue recognition guidance.\nWe believe the underlying factors used to estimate our long-term contracts costs to complete and percentage-of-completion are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of revenue and profit; however, due to the length of time over which revenues are generated and costs are incurred, along with the judgment required in developing the underlying factors, the variability of revenue and cost can be significant. Factors that may affect revenue and costs relating to long-term contracts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Sales Price Incentives and Sales Price Escalation Clauses - Sales price incentives and sales price escalations that are reasonably assured and reasonably estimable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Otherwise, these amounts are recorded when awarded.\n\u2022Cost Recovery for Product Design Changes and Claims - On occasion, design specifications may change during the course of the contract. Any additional costs arising from these changes may be supported by change orders, or we may submit a claim to the customer. Change orders are accounted for as described above. See below for our accounting policies related to claims.\n\u2022Material Availability and Costs - Our estimates of material costs generally are based on existing supplier relationships, adequate availability of materials, prevailing market prices for materials, and, in some cases, long-term supplier contracts. Changes in our supplier relationships, delays in obtaining materials, or changes in material prices can have a significant impact on our cost and profitability estimates.\n\u2022Use of Subcontractors - Our arrangements with subcontractors are generally based on fixed prices; however, our estimates of the cost and profitability can be impacted by subcontractor delays, customer claims arising from subcontractor performance issues, or a subcontractor's inability to fulfill its obligations.\n\u2022Labor Costs and Anticipated Productivity Levels - Where applicable, we include the impact of labor improvements in our estimation of costs, such as in cases where we expect a favorable learning curve over the duration of the contract. In these cases, if the improvements do not materialize, costs and profitability could be adversely impacted. Additionally, to the extent we are more or less productive than originally anticipated, estimated costs and profitability may also be impacted.\n\u2022Effect of Foreign Currency Fluctuations - Fluctuations between currencies in which our long-term contracts are denominated and the currencies under which contract costs are incurred can have an impact on profitability. When the impact on profitability is potentially significant, we may enter into FX forward contracts or prepay certain vendors for raw materials to manage the potential exposure. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on our FX forward contracts.\nIn some cases, the timing of revenue recognition, particularly for revenue recognized over time or under the percentage-of-completion method, differs from when such amounts are invoiced to customers, resulting in a contract asset (revenue recognition precedes the invoicing of the related revenue amount) or a contract liability (payment from the customer precedes\nrecognition of the related revenue amount). Contract assets are recoverable from customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specific units, or completion of the contract.\nIn contracts where a portion of the price may vary, we estimate the variable consideration at the amount to which we expect to be entitled, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.\nSee Note 1, 3, and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition policies.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to annual impairment testing. We monitor the results of each of our reporting units as a means of identifying trends and/or matters that may impact their financial results and, thus, be an indicator of a potential impairment. The trends and/or matters that we specifically monitor for each of our reporting units are as follows:\n\u2022Significant variances in financial performance (e.g., revenues, earnings and cash flows) in relation to expectations and historical performance;\n\u2022Significant changes in end markets or other economic factors;\n\u2022Significant changes or planned changes in our use of a reporting unit's assets; and\n\u2022Significant changes in customer relationships and competitive conditions.\nThe identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units. We perform our impairment testing by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the reported net assets, with such testing occurring during the fourth quarter of each year in conjunction with our annual financial planning process (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise), based primarily on events and circumstances existing as of the end of the third quarter. Fair value is generally based on the income approach using a calculation of discounted cash flows, based on the most recent financial projections for the reporting units. The revenue growth rates included in the financial projections are our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions, and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on current cost structure and, when applicable, anticipated net cost reductions.\nThe calculation of fair value for our reporting units incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, profit margin and discount factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in impairment charges in future periods.\nBased on our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2019, we concluded that the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units, exclusive of Cues, exceeded the carrying value of their respective net assets by over 100%. The estimated fair value of Cues exceeded the carrying value of its net assets by approximately 10%, while the total goodwill for Cues was $47.8 at December 31, 2019. A change in any of the assumptions used in testing Cues' goodwill for impairment (e.g., projected revenue and profit growth rates, discount rates, industry price multiples, etc.) could result in Cues' estimated fair value being less than the carrying value of its net assets. If Cues is unable to achieve the financial forecasts included in its 2019 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we may be required to record an impairment charge in a future period related to Cues' goodwill.\nWe perform our annual trademarks impairment testing during the fourth quarter, or on a more frequent basis if there are indications of potential impairment. The fair values of our trademarks are determined by applying estimated royalty rates to projected revenues, with the resulting cash flows discounted at a rate of return that reflects current market conditions. The basis for these projected revenues is the annual operating plan for each of the related businesses, which is prepared in the fourth quarter of each year.\nSee Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nDefined benefit plans cover a portion of our salaried and hourly paid employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. Additionally, domestic postretirement plans provide health and life insurance benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. We recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial gains and losses into earnings during the fourth quarter of each year, unless earlier remeasurement is required, as a component of net periodic benefit expense. The remaining\ncomponents of pension/postretirement expense, primarily interest costs and expected return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis.\nOur pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets.\nThe costs and obligations associated with these plans are determined based on actuarial valuations. The critical assumptions used in determining these related expenses and obligations are discount rates and healthcare cost projections. These critical assumptions are calculated based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated at least annually by us in consultation with outside actuaries. Other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and the rate of increase in compensation levels are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, actual results may differ.\nThe discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. This rate is the yield on high-quality fixed income investments at the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. Including the effects of recognizing actuarial gains and losses into earnings as described above, a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate for our domestic plans would have increased our 2019 pension expense by approximately $16.5, and a 50 basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our 2019 pension expense by approximately $15.1.\nThe trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate, and it can significantly impact our postretirement liabilities and costs. The healthcare cost trend rate for 2020, which is the weighted-average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, is 6.75%. This rate is assumed to decrease to 5.0% by 2027 and then remain at that level.\nSee Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe record our income taxes based on the Income Taxes Topic of the Codification, which includes an estimate of the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. We periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities, including the results of local, state, federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used.\nRealization of deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding (i) the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, (ii) expected future taxable income, and (iii) the impact of tax planning strategies. We believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefit of certain deferred tax assets and, accordingly, have established a valuation allowance against them. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including past operating results, projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of and potential changes to ongoing tax planning strategies. The projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs. Although realization is not assured for the remaining deferred tax assets, we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or alternative tax strategies. However, deferred tax assets could be reduced in the near term if our estimates of taxable income are significantly reduced or tax strategies are no longer viable.\nThe amount of income tax that we pay annually is dependent on various factors, including the timing of certain deductions and ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed adjustments. We perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for potential uncertain tax positions. Accruals for these uncertain tax positions are recorded based on an expectation as to the timing of when the matter will be resolved. As events change or resolutions occur, these accruals are adjusted, such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters.\nOur future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations, statute expirations, new regulatory or judicial pronouncements, changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income, future tax planning strategies, or other relevant events. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our uncertain tax positions.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial performance of the company, including revenues, operating income, operating cash flows, and various factors impacting the financial results.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Item 7 pertain to continuing operations only.\nExecutive Overview\nRevenues for 2019 totaled $1,525.4, compared to $1,538.6 in 2018 (and $1,425.8 in 2017). The decrease in revenues in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a decline in organic revenue, (ii) adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2019 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and $6.0, respectively, and (iii) a stronger U.S. dollar during 2019, partially offset by increases in revenues associated with the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues in 2018 and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the Heat Transfer business as a result of its wind-down activities, partially offset by increases in organic revenue for all three of our reportable segments. The increase in revenues in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to (i) the impact of the Schonstedt and Cues acquisitions, (ii) the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 (see below for additional details), and (iii) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 during 2017 resulting from revisions to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa. Organic revenue was generally flat in 2018 compared to the prior year.\nFor 2019, operating income totaled $107.9, compared to $107.6 in 2018 (and $59.9 in 2017). The increase in operating income in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to improved operating results across all three reportable segments, partially offset by increased losses associated with the large power projects in South Africa, with such losses impacted by reductions in revenues/profits of $17.5 and $6.0 during the first and second quarters of 2019, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to an increase in profits within our HVAC reportable segment associated with organic revenue growth during the year. In addition, operating income for 2017 was impacted by (i) a reduction in profit of $52.8 associated with revisions to expected revenues and profits on the large power projects in South Africa and (ii) a gain of $10.2 on a contract settlement within our Heat Transfer business.\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations totaled $152.9 in 2019, compared to $112.9 in 2018 (and $53.5 in 2017). The increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations, compared to 2018, was due primarily to reductions in working capital at certain of our businesses and a decline in cash outflows related to the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019. These improvements in operating cash flows were offset partially by a decline in net income tax refunds (net tax payments of $7.0 in 2019 versus net tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018). The increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily the result of net income tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018 (versus net income tax payments of $22.9 in 2017).\nAdditional details on certain matters noted above as well as significant items impacting the financial results for 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows:\n2019:\n\u2022On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sabik:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Sabik was $77.2, net of cash acquired of $0.6.\n\u25e6Sabik's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $28.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Sabik are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u2022On March 14, 2019, as part of the business's wind-down activities, we completed the sale of Heat Transfer's manufacturing facility:\n\u25e6Cash proceeds from the sale totaled $5.5.\n\u25e6The sale resulted in a gain of $0.3, which is recorded within Other expense, net.\u201d\n\u2022Adjustments to Revenues and Profits on the Large Power Projects in South Africa:\n\u25e6During the first quarter of 2019, in consideration of recent claims received from the prime contractors on the projects, and in accordance with ASC 606, we analyzed the risk of a significant revenue reversal associated with the amount of variable consideration recorded for the projects. Based on such analysis, we reduced the amount of cumulative revenue associated with the variable consideration on the projects by $17.5.\n\u25e6On June 28, 2019, DBT reached an agreement with Alstom/GE, one of the prime contractors on the projects, to, among other things, settle all material outstanding claims between the parties (other than certain pass-through\nclaims related to third-parties). In connection with the agreement, we reduced the revenues associated with the projects by $6.0 during the second quarter of 2019.\n\u25e6See Notes 5 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On July 3, 2019, we completed the acquisition of SGS:\n\u25e6The purchase price for SGS was $10.0, plus a deferred payment not to exceed $1.5.\n\u25e6SGS's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $12.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of SGS are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.\n\u2022On November 12, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Patterson-Kelley:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Patterson-Kelley was $59.9.\n\u25e6Patterson-Kelley's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $35.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Patterson-Kelley are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.\n\u2022On December 17, 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement:\n\u25e6In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.6 associated with the write-off of a portion of deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement.\n\u25e6See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded net actuarial losses of $10.0 in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Changes in the Estimated Fair Value of an Equity Security:\n\u25e6During 2019, we recorded gains of $7.9 within Other expense, net\u201d related to increases in the estimated fair value of an equity security that we hold.\n\u25e6See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additions details.\n2018:\n\u2022Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new standard on revenue recognition ( ASC 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective transition approach:\n\u25e6The most significant effect of adopting ASC 606 was on our power transformer business.\n\u25e6The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase in revenues of $14.2 and an increase in operating income of $2.0 during 2018 as compared to the amounts that would have been recorded under the prior revenue recognition standard.\n\u25e6See Notes 1, 3, and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Schonstedt:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Schonstedt was $16.4, net of cash acquired of $0.3.\n\u25e6Schonstedt's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $9.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Schonstedt are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u2022On March 8, 2018, we settled our then-existing interest rate swap agreement ( Old Swaps\u201d) and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement ( New Swaps\u201d).\n\u25e6Old Swaps\n\u25aaWe discontinued hedge accounting for the Old Swaps in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with an amendment of our senior credit agreement.\n\u25aaDuring the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a gain of $0.6 (to Other expense, net\u201d) representing the change in fair value of the Old Swaps from January 1, 2018 through the date of settlement on March 8, 2018.\n\u25e6New Swaps\n\u25aaThe New Swaps had an initial notional amount of $260.0 and effectively convert a portion of our borrowings under our senior credit agreement to a fixed interest rate of 2.535%, plus the applicable margin.\n\u25aaWe have designated, and are accounting for, the New Swaps as cash flow hedges.\n\u25e6See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On April 30, 2018, we reached an agreement with a subsidiary of mutares AG, the acquirer of Balcke D\u00fcrr in 2016 (the Buyer\u201d), on (i) the amount of cash and working capital of Balcke D\u00fcrr at the closing date of the sale and (ii) various other matters. The settlement resulted in:\n\u25e6A net payment from the Buyer in the amount of Euro 3.0; and\n\u25e6A gain, net of tax, of $3.8, which was recorded to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d during 2018.\n\u2022On June 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Cues:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Cues was $164.4, net of cash acquired of $20.6.\n\u25e6Cues' revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $84.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Cues are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2018, as a continuation of our strategic shift away from power generation end markets, we initiated a plan to wind-down the Heat Transfer business.\n\u25e6In connection with the planned wind-down, we recorded charges of $3.5 during 2018, with $0.9 related to the write-down of inventories (included in Cost of products sold\u201d), $0.6 related to the impairment of machinery and equipment and $2.0 related to severance costs (both included in Special charges, net\u201d).\n\u25e6In addition, we sold certain intangible assets of the Heat Transfer business for net cash proceeds of $4.8, which resulted in a gain of less than $0.1 within our 2018 operating results.\n\u2022Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded net actuarial losses of $6.6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n2017:\n\u2022Income Tax Matters:\n\u25e6During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $77.6 for a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary.\n\u25e6On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted which significantly changed U.S. income tax law for businesses and individuals. As a result of the Act, we recorded provisional net income tax charges of $11.8 during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Gain from a Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately canceled by a customer. In connection with the settlement, we:\n\u25e6Received cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration; and\n\u25e6Recorded a gain of $10.2.\n\u2022On December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement:\n\u25e6In connection with the amendment, we recorded:\n\u25aaA charge of $0.9 associated with the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement; and\n\u25aaA gain of $2.7 related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing term loan.\n\u25e6See Notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Actuarial Gains and Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded:\n\u25aaAn actuarial gain during the third quarter of 2017 of $2.6 related to an amendment to our postretirement plans; and\n\u25aaNet actuarial losses of $4.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nCyclicality of End Markets, Seasonality and Competition-The financial results of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries in which they operate and end markets in which they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. For example, our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nAlthough our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, the impact accounting standard adoptions, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the first and second quarter of 2019, third quarter of 2018, and second and fourth quarter of 2017 revisions to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa, which resulted in an aggregate reduction of revenues of $23.5 in 2019, $2.7 in 2018, and $36.9 in 2017. We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue growth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, including the reconciliation of organic revenue growth (decline) to net revenue increase (decline):\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n* Not meaningful for comparison purposes.\nRevenues - For 2019, the decrease in revenues, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a decline in organic revenue, (ii) adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2019 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and $6.0, respectively, and (iii) a stronger U.S. dollar during 2019, partially offset by increases in revenues associated with the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues in 2018 and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the Heat Transfer business as a result of its wind-down activities, partially offset by increases in organic revenue for all three of our reportable segments. See Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\u201d for additional details.\nFor 2018, the increase in revenues, compared to 2017, was due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues during 2018. In addition, revenues were higher, when compared to 2017, due to (i) the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and (ii) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 during 2017 resulting from revisions to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. Organic revenue was generally flat in 2018 as the significant increases for the businesses within our HVAC reportable segment were offset by declines associated with (i) lower sales of process cooling products and (ii) the continued wind-down of our Heat Transfer business and our large power projects in South Africa. See \"Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\" for additional details.\nGross Profit - For 2019, the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a more profitable revenue mix and (ii) operational improvements within the cooling businesses of our HVAC reportable segment and power transformer business of our Engineered Solutions reportable segment during 2019. The more profitable revenue mix resulted from increases in revenues associated with acquired businesses that generally have higher gross margins (i.e., Cues and Sabik) and decreases in revenues for businesses that historically generate lower gross margins (i.e., DBT and Heat Transfer). In addition, for 2019, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were impacted negatively by the aggregate reduction in revenue noted above of $23.5 associated with the large power projects in South Africa.\nFor 2018, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, compared to 2017, were favorably impacted by the increase in revenues noted above. Additionally, during 2017, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted by a reduction in gross profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions to expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. Lastly, during 2018, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by (i) charges of $4.6 associated with the excess fair value (over historical cost) of inventory acquired in the Schonstedt and Cues transactions which was subsequently sold in 2018 and (ii) a decline in profitability during 2018 for our power transformer business associated primarily with a less profitable sale mix, higher commodity costs, and less favorable cost absorption.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expense - For 2019, the increase in SG&A, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the incremental SG&A associated with the acquisitions noted above.\nFor 2018, the increase in SG&A expense, compared to 2017, was primarily a result of the incremental SG&A associated with Schonstedt and Cues since their respective dates of acquisition and higher professional fees related to acquisition activities, partially offset by cost reductions associated with restructuring actions.\nIntangible Amortization - For 2019, the increase in intangible amortization, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the impact of the intangible assets acquired in the Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley transactions, and a full year of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cues transaction.\nFor 2018, the increase in intangible amortization, compared to 2018, was due to the impact of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Schonstedt and Cues transactions.\nSpecial Charges, Net - Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce, and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in 2019, 2018, and 2017. The components of special charges, net, are as follows:\n\nGain on Contract Settlement - During 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately canceled by a customer of our Heat Transfer business for cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a gain of $10.2.\nOther Operating Expenses - During 2019, we recorded charges associated with revisions to estimates of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2016 sale of the dry cooling business, with such revisions resulting from settlement activities during the first quarter of 2019.\nOther Expense, Net - Other expense, net, for 2019 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $9.9, charges of $4.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, and foreign currency transaction losses of $1.5, partially offset by a gain of $7.9 related to changes in the estimated fair value of an equity security that we hold and income derived from company-owned life insurance policies of $4.0.\nOther expense, net, for 2018 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $3.9, charges of $5.0 associated with legacy environmental matters, and charges of $2.0 associated with asbestos product liability matters, partially offset by income of $1.5 related to the reduction of the parent company guarantees and bank surety bonds liability and the amortization of related indemnification assets that remain outstanding in connection with the Balcke D\u00fcrr sale, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $0.9, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.6.\nOther expense, net, for 2017 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $5.1, charges of $3.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $2.9, and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives of $0.6, partially offset by a gain of $2.7 associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting on our\ninterest rate swap agreements, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $1.7, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.7.\nInterest Expense, net - Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The decrease in interest expense, net, during 2019, compared to 2018, was the result of lower average debt balances during 2019.\nThe increase in interest expense, net, during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily a result of the borrowings required to finance the acquisition of Cues and a higher weighted-average interest rate during 2018 on the outstanding borrowings of our senior credit facilities.\nLoss on Amendment/Refinancing of Senior Credit Agreement - During the fourth quarter of 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.6, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we elected to reduce the issuance capacity of our foreign credit facilities under our senior credit agreement by $50.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $0.4 associated with the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the $50.0 of previously available issuance capacity.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.9, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nIncome Taxes - During 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $13.5 on $83.2 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 16.2%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2019 were (i) $1.9 of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation awards that vested and/or were exercised during the year, (ii) a $1.9 tax benefit associated with an adjustment to the taxation of foreign earnings, (iii) $1.3 of tax benefits related to our U.S. tax credits and incentives, and (iv) $1.2 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by $3.8 of tax expense related to various valuation allowance adjustments, primarily due to foreign losses generated during the period for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nDuring 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $1.4 on $79.6 of pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of 1.8%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2018 were (i) the utilization of $33.0 of prior years' losses generated in foreign jurisdictions in which no benefit was previously recognized, (ii) $7.0 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, and (iii) $2.2 of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation awards that vested during the year.\nDuring 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $47.9 on $36.1 of a pre-tax income from continuing operations, resulting in an effective tax rate of (132.7)%. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for 2017 were (i) a tax benefit of $77.6 related to a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary and (ii) $4.9 of tax benefits related to various audit settlements, statute expirations, and other adjustments to liabilities for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by (iii) $11.8 of net tax charges associated with the impact of the Act and (iv) $68.2 of foreign losses generated during the year for which no foreign tax benefit was recognized as future realization of any such foreign tax benefit is considered unlikely.\nResults of Discontinued Operations\nSale of Balcke D\u00fcrr Business\nOn December 30, 2016, we completed the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr. In connection with the sale, we recorded a net loss of $78.6 to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d during 2016.\nDuring 2017, we reduced the net loss associated with the sale of Balcke D\u00fcrr by $6.8. The reduction was comprised of an additional income tax benefit recorded for the sale of $9.4, partially offset by the impact", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\n(All currency and share amounts are in millions)\nThe following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in Item 7 pertain to continuing operations only.\nExecutive Overview\nRevenues for 2019 totaled $1,525.4, compared to $1,538.6 in 2018 (and $1,425.8 in 2017). The decrease in revenues in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a decline in organic revenue, (ii) adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2019 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and $6.0, respectively, and (iii) a stronger U.S. dollar during 2019, partially offset by increases in revenues associated with the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues in 2018 and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the Heat Transfer business as a result of its wind-down activities, partially offset by increases in organic revenue for all three of our reportable segments. The increase in revenues in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to (i) the impact of the Schonstedt and Cues acquisitions, (ii) the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 (see below for additional details), and (iii) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 during 2017 resulting from revisions to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa. Organic revenue was generally flat in 2018 compared to the prior year.\nFor 2019, operating income totaled $107.9, compared to $107.6 in 2018 (and $59.9 in 2017). The increase in operating income in 2019, compared to 2018, was due primarily to improved operating results across all three reportable segments, partially offset by increased losses associated with the large power projects in South Africa, with such losses impacted by reductions in revenues/profits of $17.5 and $6.0 during the first and second quarters of 2019, respectively. The increase in operating income in 2018, compared to 2017, was due primarily to an increase in profits within our HVAC reportable segment associated with organic revenue growth during the year. In addition, operating income for 2017 was impacted by (i) a reduction in profit of $52.8 associated with revisions to expected revenues and profits on the large power projects in South Africa and (ii) a gain of $10.2 on a contract settlement within our Heat Transfer business.\nOperating cash flows from continuing operations totaled $152.9 in 2019, compared to $112.9 in 2018 (and $53.5 in 2017). The increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations, compared to 2018, was due primarily to reductions in working capital at certain of our businesses and a decline in cash outflows related to the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019. These improvements in operating cash flows were offset partially by a decline in net income tax refunds (net tax payments of $7.0 in 2019 versus net tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018). The increase in operating cash flows from continuing operations in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily the result of net income tax refunds of $44.3 in 2018 (versus net income tax payments of $22.9 in 2017).\nAdditional details on certain matters noted above as well as significant items impacting the financial results for 2019, 2018, and 2017 are as follows:\n2019:\n\u2022On February 1, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Sabik:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Sabik was $77.2, net of cash acquired of $0.6.\n\u25e6Sabik's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $28.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Sabik are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u2022On March 14, 2019, as part of the business's wind-down activities, we completed the sale of Heat Transfer's manufacturing facility:\n\u25e6Cash proceeds from the sale totaled $5.5.\n\u25e6The sale resulted in a gain of $0.3, which is recorded within Other expense, net.\u201d\n\u2022Adjustments to Revenues and Profits on the Large Power Projects in South Africa:\n\u25e6During the first quarter of 2019, in consideration of recent claims received from the prime contractors on the projects, and in accordance with ASC 606, we analyzed the risk of a significant revenue reversal associated with the amount of variable consideration recorded for the projects. Based on such analysis, we reduced the amount of cumulative revenue associated with the variable consideration on the projects by $17.5.\n\u25e6On June 28, 2019, DBT reached an agreement with Alstom/GE, one of the prime contractors on the projects, to, among other things, settle all material outstanding claims between the parties (other than certain pass-through\nclaims related to third-parties). In connection with the agreement, we reduced the revenues associated with the projects by $6.0 during the second quarter of 2019.\n\u25e6See Notes 5 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On July 3, 2019, we completed the acquisition of SGS:\n\u25e6The purchase price for SGS was $10.0, plus a deferred payment not to exceed $1.5.\n\u25e6SGS's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $12.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of SGS are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.\n\u2022On November 12, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Patterson-Kelley:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Patterson-Kelley was $59.9.\n\u25e6Patterson-Kelley's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $35.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Patterson-Kelley are reflected within our HVAC reportable segment.\n\u2022On December 17, 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement:\n\u25e6In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.6 associated with the write-off of a portion of deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement.\n\u25e6See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded net actuarial losses of $10.0 in the fourth quarter of 2019 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Changes in the Estimated Fair Value of an Equity Security:\n\u25e6During 2019, we recorded gains of $7.9 within Other expense, net\u201d related to increases in the estimated fair value of an equity security that we hold.\n\u25e6See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additions details.\n2018:\n\u2022Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new standard on revenue recognition ( ASC 606\u201d) using the modified retrospective transition approach:\n\u25e6The most significant effect of adopting ASC 606 was on our power transformer business.\n\u25e6The adoption of ASC 606 resulted in an increase in revenues of $14.2 and an increase in operating income of $2.0 during 2018 as compared to the amounts that would have been recorded under the prior revenue recognition standard.\n\u25e6See Notes 1, 3, and 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On March 1, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Schonstedt:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Schonstedt was $16.4, net of cash acquired of $0.3.\n\u25e6Schonstedt's revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $9.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Schonstedt are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u2022On March 8, 2018, we settled our then-existing interest rate swap agreement ( Old Swaps\u201d) and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement ( New Swaps\u201d).\n\u25e6Old Swaps\n\u25aaWe discontinued hedge accounting for the Old Swaps in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with an amendment of our senior credit agreement.\n\u25aaDuring the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a gain of $0.6 (to Other expense, net\u201d) representing the change in fair value of the Old Swaps from January 1, 2018 through the date of settlement on March 8, 2018.\n\u25e6New Swaps\n\u25aaThe New Swaps had an initial notional amount of $260.0 and effectively convert a portion of our borrowings under our senior credit agreement to a fixed interest rate of 2.535%, plus the applicable margin.\n\u25aaWe have designated, and are accounting for, the New Swaps as cash flow hedges.\n\u25e6See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022On April 30, 2018, we reached an agreement with a subsidiary of mutares AG, the acquirer of Balcke D\u00fcrr in 2016 (the Buyer\u201d), on (i) the amount of cash and working capital of Balcke D\u00fcrr at the closing date of the sale and (ii) various other matters. The settlement resulted in:\n\u25e6A net payment from the Buyer in the amount of Euro 3.0; and\n\u25e6A gain, net of tax, of $3.8, which was recorded to Gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d during 2018.\n\u2022On June 7, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Cues:\n\u25e6The purchase price for Cues was $164.4, net of cash acquired of $20.6.\n\u25e6Cues' revenues for the twelve months prior to the date of acquisition were approximately $84.0.\n\u25e6The post-acquisition operating results of Cues are reflected within our Detection and Measurement reportable segment.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022During the second quarter of 2018, as a continuation of our strategic shift away from power generation end markets, we initiated a plan to wind-down the Heat Transfer business.\n\u25e6In connection with the planned wind-down, we recorded charges of $3.5 during 2018, with $0.9 related to the write-down of inventories (included in Cost of products sold\u201d), $0.6 related to the impairment of machinery and equipment and $2.0 related to severance costs (both included in Special charges, net\u201d).\n\u25e6In addition, we sold certain intangible assets of the Heat Transfer business for net cash proceeds of $4.8, which resulted in a gain of less than $0.1 within our 2018 operating results.\n\u2022Actuarial Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded net actuarial losses of $6.6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n2017:\n\u2022Income Tax Matters:\n\u25e6During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $77.6 for a worthless stock deduction in the U.S. associated with our investment in a South African subsidiary.\n\u25e6On December 22, 2017, the Act was enacted which significantly changed U.S. income tax law for businesses and individuals. As a result of the Act, we recorded provisional net income tax charges of $11.8 during the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Gain from a Contract Settlement - During the third quarter of 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately canceled by a customer. In connection with the settlement, we:\n\u25e6Received cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration; and\n\u25e6Recorded a gain of $10.2.\n\u2022On December 19, 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement:\n\u25e6In connection with the amendment, we recorded:\n\u25aaA charge of $0.9 associated with the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs associated with the senior credit agreement; and\n\u25aaA gain of $2.7 related to the discontinuance of hedge accounting for the interest rate swap agreements that we entered into to hedge the interest rate risk on our then existing term loan.\n\u25e6See Notes 13 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\n\u2022Actuarial Gains and Losses on Pension and Postretirement Plans:\n\u25e6We recorded:\n\u25aaAn actuarial gain during the third quarter of 2017 of $2.6 related to an amendment to our postretirement plans; and\n\u25aaNet actuarial losses of $4.2 in the fourth quarter of 2017 in connection with the annual remeasurement of our pension and postretirement plans.\n\u25e6See Notes 1 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nCyclicality of End Markets, Seasonality and Competition-The financial results of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries in which they operate and end markets in which they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. For example, our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nAlthough our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors.\nNon-GAAP Measures - Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, the impact accounting standard adoptions, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the first and second quarter of 2019, third quarter of 2018, and second and fourth quarter of 2017 revisions to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa, which resulted in an aggregate reduction of revenues of $23.5 in 2019, $2.7 in 2018, and $36.9 in 2017. We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue growth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe following table provides selected financial information for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, including the reconciliation of organic revenue growth (decline) to net revenue increase (decline):\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a decline in organic revenue, (ii) adjustments during the first and second quarters of 2019 to revenues on the large power projects in South Africa of $17.5 and $6.0, respectively, and (iii) a stronger U.S. dollar during 2019, partially offset by increases in revenues associated with the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues in 2018 and Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley in 2019. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily to lower sales related to (i) the large power projects in South Africa, as these projects were in the latter stages of completion during 2019, and (ii) the Heat Transfer business as a result of its wind-down activities, partially offset by increases in organic revenue for all three of our reportable segments. See Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\u201d for additional details.\nFor 2018, the increase in revenues, compared to 2017, was due primarily to the impact of the acquisitions of Schonstedt and Cues during 2018. In addition, revenues were higher, when compared to 2017, due to (i) the impact of the adoption of ASC 606 and (ii) a reduction in revenue of $36.9 during 2017 resulting from revisions to the expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. Organic revenue was generally flat in 2018 as the significant increases for the businesses within our HVAC reportable segment were offset by declines associated with (i) lower sales of process cooling products and (ii) the continued wind-down of our Heat Transfer business and our large power projects in South Africa. See \"Results of Reportable and Other Operating Segments\" for additional details.\nGross Profit - For 2019, the increase in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue, compared to 2018, was due primarily to (i) a more profitable revenue mix and (ii) operational improvements within the cooling businesses of our HVAC reportable segment and power transformer business of our Engineered Solutions reportable segment during 2019. The more profitable revenue mix resulted from increases in revenues associated with acquired businesses that generally have higher gross margins (i.e., Cues and Sabik) and decreases in revenues for businesses that historically generate lower gross margins (i.e., DBT and Heat Transfer). In addition, for 2019, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were impacted negatively by the aggregate reduction in revenue noted above of $23.5 associated with the large power projects in South Africa.\nFor 2018, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues, compared to 2017, were favorably impacted by the increase in revenues noted above. Additionally, during 2017, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues were negatively impacted by a reduction in gross profit of $52.8 resulting from revisions to expected revenues and costs on our large power projects in South Africa. Lastly, during 2018, gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by (i) charges of $4.6 associated with the excess fair value (over historical cost) of inventory acquired in the Schonstedt and Cues transactions which was subsequently sold in 2018 and (ii) a decline in profitability during 2018 for our power transformer business associated primarily with a less profitable sale mix, higher commodity costs, and less favorable cost absorption.\nSelling, General and Administrative ( SG&A\u201d) Expense - For 2019, the increase in SG&A, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the incremental SG&A associated with the acquisitions noted above.\nFor 2018, the increase in SG&A expense, compared to 2017, was primarily a result of the incremental SG&A associated with Schonstedt and Cues since their respective dates of acquisition and higher professional fees related to acquisition activities, partially offset by cost reductions associated with restructuring actions.\nIntangible Amortization - For 2019, the increase in intangible amortization, compared to 2018, was due primarily to the impact of the intangible assets acquired in the Sabik, SGS, and Patterson-Kelley transactions, and a full year of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cues transaction.\nFor 2018, the increase in intangible amortization, compared to 2018, was due to the impact of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Schonstedt and Cues transactions.\nSpecial Charges, Net - Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce, and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in 2019, 2018, and 2017. The components of special charges, net, are as follows:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee termination costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility consolidation costs </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other cash costs, net </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash asset write-downs </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGain on Contract Settlement - During 2017, we settled a contract that had been suspended and then ultimately canceled by a customer of our Heat Transfer business for cash proceeds of $9.0 and other consideration. In connection with the settlement, we recorded a gain of $10.2.\nOther Operating Expenses - During 2019, we recorded charges associated with revisions to estimates of certain liabilities retained in connection with the 2016 sale of the dry cooling business, with such revisions resulting from settlement activities during the first quarter of 2019.\nOther Expense, Net - Other expense, net, for 2019 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $9.9, charges of $4.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, and foreign currency transaction losses of $1.5, partially offset by a gain of $7.9 related to changes in the estimated fair value of an equity security that we hold and income derived from company-owned life insurance policies of $4.0.\nOther expense, net, for 2018 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $3.9, charges of $5.0 associated with legacy environmental matters, and charges of $2.0 associated with asbestos product liability matters, partially offset by income of $1.5 related to the reduction of the parent company guarantees and bank surety bonds liability and the amortization of related indemnification assets that remain outstanding in connection with the Balcke D\u00fcrr sale, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $0.9, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.6.\nOther expense, net, for 2017 was composed primarily of pension and postretirement expense of $5.1, charges of $3.5 associated with asbestos product liability matters, foreign currency transaction losses of $2.9, and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives of $0.6, partially offset by a gain of $2.7 associated with the discontinuance of hedge accounting on our\ninterest rate swap agreements, income from company-owned life insurance policies of $1.7, and equity earnings in joint ventures of $0.7.\nInterest Expense, net - Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The decrease in interest expense, net, during 2019, compared to 2018, was the result of lower average debt balances during 2019.\nThe increase in interest expense, net, during 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily a result of the borrowings required to finance the acquisition of Cues and a higher weighted-average interest rate during 2018 on the outstanding borrowings of our senior credit facilities.\nLoss on Amendment/Refinancing of Senior Credit Agreement - During the fourth quarter of 2019, we amended our senior credit agreement. In connection with the amendment, we recorded a charge of $0.6, which consisted of the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to our senior credit facilities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, we elected to reduce the issuance capacity of our foreign credit facilities under our senior credit agreement by $50.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $0.4 associated with the write-off of the unamortized deferred financing costs related to the $50.0 of previously available issuance capacity.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we amended our senior credit agreement.
