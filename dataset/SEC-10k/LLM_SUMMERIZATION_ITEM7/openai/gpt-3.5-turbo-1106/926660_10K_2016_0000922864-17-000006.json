Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Overview\nWe are focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment and limited development of quality apartment communities diversified by geography in the largest coastal and job growth markets in the United States and also diversified across price points.\nOur principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our equity holders, as measured by growth in Economic Income and Adjusted Funds From Operations. Economic Income is our measure of total return and Adjusted Funds From Operations is our measure of current return. In 2016, Economic Income totaled approximately $7 per share, representing a 15% return on our estimated net asset value at the beginning of that measurement period. Adjusted Funds From Operations was $1.97 per share, an increase of 5% as compared to 2015. Our calculation of Economic Income relies upon net asset value, or NAV. NAV and Adjusted Funds From Operations are non-GAAP measures and are defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nOur business and strategic areas of focus are described in more detail within the Business Overview in Item 1. Execution of our goals within our strategic areas of focus drove solid results for Aimco in 2016, as further described in the sections that follow.\nProperty Operations\nWe own and operate a portfolio of conventional apartment communities, diversified by both geography and price point. At December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio included 134 apartment communities with 37,922 apartment homes in which we held an average ownership of approximately 97%. We also operate a portfolio of affordable apartment communities, which primarily consists of communities owned through low-income housing tax credit partnerships, and with rents generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Consolidated apartment communities that we manage within our conventional and affordable portfolios comprise our reportable segments and generated 90% and 10%, respectively, of our proportionate property net operating income, or NOI, (defined below under the Results of Operations - Property Operations heading) during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn our conventional same store portfolio, revenue and expense grew 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively, leading to 6.2% growth in property net operating income. Revenue growth was due to a weighted average rent increase of 4.0% and an average daily occupancy of 95.9%, which was consistent with 2015. We focus on customer satisfaction and resident retention, which results in lower resident turnover and reduces vacancy related costs. We receive approximately 90,000 customer satisfaction surveys annually and achieved an average rating of 4.18 (on a 1 to 5 scale) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur focus on efficient operations through centralization of administrative tasks, optimization of economies of scale at the corporate level and investment in more durable, longer-lived materials has helped us control operating expenses. As a result of these efforts, our conventional same store controllable operating expenses, which we define as property level operating expenses before real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, had a compound annual growth rate of 2.1% over the last three years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio provided 68% operating margins and 62% free cash flow, or FCF, margins. FCF is defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nRedevelopment and Development\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $155.4 million in redevelopment, $85.2 million of which related to the ongoing redevelopment of Park Towne Place and The Sterling, mixed-use communities located in Center City Philadelphia. We are redeveloping the three of the four towers at Park Towne Place, one at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed lease-up of the South Tower and had leased 70% of the apartment homes in the East Tower. Rental rates are consistent with underwriting. Based on the success of the first two towers, we commenced redevelopment of the North Tower during 2016, completing de-leasing in the third quarter and starting construction in the fourth quarter. We will continue to evaluate the success of the redevelopment and may redevelop the fourth tower in the community.\nWe are redeveloping The Sterling, a 30-story building, two or three floors at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed 88% of the apartment homes, of which 92% had been leased. Rental rates are in line with underwriting. Three floors, representing 12% of the homes, and 37,000 square feet of commercial space remain under construction with anticipated completion in second quarter 2017.\nDuring 2016, we commenced four additional redevelopments with an estimated net investment of $81.4 million. These redevelopments include: Bay Parc Plaza in Miami, Florida; Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California; Yorktown in suburban Chicago; and the second phase of redevelopment at The Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles, California. For additional information regarding these redevelopments, please refer to the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading below.\nDuring 2016, we achieved NOI stabilization at three redeveloped apartment communities in California, Lincoln Place in Venice, Ocean House on Prospect in La Jolla and Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera. The redevelopment of these apartment communities resulted in value creation of approximately $170.0 million, or about 30% of our $582.0 million investment in these projects.\nDuring 2016, we invested $31.8 million in development, primarily in the completion of One Canal in Boston. Lease-up is nearing completion, with 86% of the apartment homes occupied at December 31, 2016, a pace well ahead of schedule and at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nDuring 2016, our Vivo community in Cambridge, Massachusetts achieved stabilized occupancy two months ahead of schedule with rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nSee below under the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Redevelopment and Development heading for additional information regarding our ongoing redevelopments at December 31, 2016.\nPortfolio Management\nOur portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of apartment communities that is diversified across A,\u201d B,\u201d and C+\u201d price points, averaging B/B+\u201d in quality, and that is diversified across the largest coastal and job growth markets in the U.S. We measure conventional apartment community quality based on average rents of our apartment homes compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis. Under this rating system, we classify as A\u201d quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than 125% of the local market average, as B\u201d quality apartment communities those earning rents between 90% and 125% of the local market average; as C+\u201d quality apartment communities those with rents greater than $1,100 per month, but lower than 90% of local market average; and as C\u201d quality apartment communities those with rents less than $1,100 per month and lower than 90% of local market average. We classify as B/B+\u201d quality a portfolio that on average earns rents between 100% and 125% of the local market average rents where the portfolio is located. Although some companies and analysts within the multifamily real estate industry use apartment community quality ratings of A,\u201d B\u201d and C,\u201d some of which are tied to local market rent averages, the metrics used to classify apartment community quality as well as the timing for which local markets rents are calculated may vary from company to company.\nAccordingly, our rating system for measuring apartment community quality is neither broadly nor consistently used in the multifamily real estate industry.\nAs part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell each year up to 10% of the apartment communities in our portfolio with lower projected free cash flow returns and invest the proceeds from such sales through property upgrades and redevelopment of communities in our current portfolio, occasional development of new communities and selective acquisition of apartment communities with projected free cash flow returns higher than expected from the communities sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, we have significantly increased the quality and expected growth rate of our portfolio as evidenced by increased average revenue per apartment home for the portfolio and higher average rents compared to local market average rents.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of Conventional Net Operating Income in target markets\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Average Rents as a Percentage of Local Market Average Rents\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage A (4Q 2016 Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home $2,505)\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage B (4Q 2016 Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home $1,771)\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage C+ (4Q 2016 Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home $1,595)\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage C\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Represents average monthly rental and other property revenues divided by the number of occupied apartment homes multiplied by our economic interest in the apartment community as of the end of the current period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio average revenue per effective apartment home was $1,978, an increase of 34.6% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to rent growth from the improved quality of our portfolio, driven in part by the sale of conventional apartment communities during these periods with average monthly revenues per effective apartment home substantially lower than those of the retained portfolio, and also by our reinvestment of the sales proceeds through redevelopment, development and acquisition of apartment communities with higher rents and better free cash flow return prospects.\nAfter several years of above-trend rent growth, we are seeing rent growth in many markets decelerate due to competitive new supply. As a result of our diversification by both geography and price point, our exposure to competitive new supply is largely limited to approximately one quarter of our portfolio, represented by A\u201d price point communities in submarkets with more than 2% supply growth projected over the next year. This exposure is mitigated in some submarkets where the rate of job growth exceeds the rate of supply growth, and in other submarkets where our A\u201d rents are substantially lower than the rents charged by new supply.\nAs we execute our portfolio strategy, we expect to increase conventional portfolio average revenue per apartment home at a rate greater than market rent growth; increase FCF margins; and increase the percentage of our conventional property net operating income earned in our target markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven conventional apartment communities with 3,045 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $517.0 million. After payment of transaction costs, working capital adjustments and distributions to noncontrolling interests, our share of the net proceeds totaled $509.1 million. We sold one apartment community from our low-income housing tax credit portfolio for gross proceeds of $27.5 million. After repayment of property debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to noncontrolling interests, our share of the net proceeds totaled $10.3 million. We invested these proceeds in redevelopment and development discussed below, as well as the acquisition for $320 million of Indigo, a 463-home apartment community in Redwood City, California that was in the final stages of construction at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, leasing was well ahead of schedule, with 77% of apartment homes occupied at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOur leverage strategy seeks to increase financial returns while using leverage with appropriate caution. We target the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA to be below 7.0x and we target the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x. We also focus on the ratios of Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense. Proportionate Debt, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Interest Expense, as used in these ratios, are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and reconciled under the Non-GAAP Measures - Leverage Ratios heading below. Preferred Equity represents Aimco's preferred stock and the Aimco Operating\nPartnership's preferred OP units. Our leverage ratios for the trailing twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, are presented below:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Trailing Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>6.3x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>6.7x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense\n</td> <td>3.2x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends\n</td> <td>2.9x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect future leverage reduction from earnings growth, especially as apartment communities now being redeveloped are completed and the lease-up of Indigo is completed, and from regularly scheduled property debt amortization funded from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2016, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair value of approximately $1.6 billion.\nTwo credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness, using different methodologies and ratios for assessing our credit. In 2015, both of these agencies upgraded our credit rating and outlook to BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Although some of the ratios they use are similar to those we use to measure our leverage, there are differences in our methods of calculation and therefore our leverage ratios disclosed above are not indicative of the ratios that may be calculated by these agencies.\nDuring 2016, we closed fixed-rate, non-recourse, amortizing, property loans totaling $393.5 million with a weighted average term of 9.4 years and weighted average interest rate of 3.2%, which were on average 145 basis points over the corresponding Treasury rates at the time of pricing. During 2016, we also amended our $600.0 million revolving credit facility, extending its maturity to January 2022. For additional information regarding our leverage, please see the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading.\nCulture\nOur culture is the key to our success. Our emphasis on a collaborative, respectful, and performance-oriented culture is what enables the continuing transformation of the Aimco business. In 2016, Aimco was recognized by the Denver Post as a Top Work Place for the fourth consecutive year. We were one of only three mid-size companies to be named a Top Work Place in Colorado for the past four consecutive years.\nKey Financial Indicators\nThe key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our operating performance are Economic Income, our measure of total return, and Adjusted Funds From Operations, our measure of current return. In addition to these indicators, we evaluate our operating performance and financial condition using: Pro forma Funds From Operations; FCF capitalization rate; NOI capitalization rate; same store property operating results; proportionate property NOI; average revenue per effective apartment home; financial coverage ratios; and net leverage. Certain of these financial indicators are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined, further described and, for certain of the measures, reconciled to comparable GAAP-based measures, under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nResults of Operations\nBecause our operating results depend primarily on income from our apartment communities, the supply of and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our apartment communities and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment communities affect our operating results.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nOverview\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership increased by $181.7 million and $190.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in income was principally due to an increase in gains on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from redeveloped and developed apartment communities placed into service during 2016 and from recent acquisitions.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership decreased by $60.5 million and $64.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in income was principally due to a decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by the effect of various other items discussed below.\nThe following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of operations of Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership in more detail.\nProperty Operations\nAs described under the preceding Executive Overview heading, our owned real estate portfolio consists primarily of conventional apartment communities. We also operate a portfolio of affordable apartment communities, the majority of which are held in low-income housing tax credit partnerships. Our conventional and affordable real estate operations that we manage and that are not classified as held for sale at the end of the current period comprise our reportable segments.\nDue to the range of our economic ownership interests in our apartment communities, we use proportionate property NOI to assess the operating performance of our apartment communities and our operating segments. Proportionate property NOI reflects our share of rental and other property revenues reduced by direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes, for the consolidated apartment communities that we manage. Accordingly, the results of operations of our conventional and affordable segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four conventional apartment communities with 142 apartment homes and eight affordable apartment communities with 727 apartment homes that we do not manage and one affordable community with 52 apartment homes that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016.\nWe do not include property management revenues, offsite costs associated with property management or casualty-related amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. Refer to Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reportable segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.\nConventional Real Estate Operations\nOur Conventional segment consists of apartment communities we classify as Conventional Same Store and Conventional Non-Same Store. Conventional Same Store apartment communities are those that have reached stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of a two year comparable period and maintained it throughout the current and comparable prior year, and that are not expected to be sold within 12 months. Conventional Non-Same Store consists of conventional redevelopment and development apartment communities, which are those currently under construction that are not occupancy stabilized and those that have been completed in recent years that had not achieved and maintained stabilized occupancy for both the current and comparable prior year, and conventional acquisition apartment communities, which are those we have acquired since the beginning of a two year comparable period. Conventional Non-Same Store also includes apartment communities subject to agreements that limit the amount by which we may increase rents; apartment communities that had not reached or maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of the beginning of a two year comparable period, often due to a casualty event; and apartment communities expected to be sold within 12 months but do not yet meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as defined by our segment performance metrics, our conventional portfolio consisted of the following:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>101 Conventional Same Store apartment communities with 30,893 apartment homes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>29 Conventional Non-Same Store apartment communities with 6,887 apartment homes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFrom December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, on a net basis, our Conventional Same Store portfolio decreased by six apartment communities and 2,256 apartment homes. This change consisted of:\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>five conventional redevelopment apartment communities with 1,544 apartment homes that were reclassified into Conventional Non-Same Store;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>one apartment community with 246 apartment homes reclassified into Conventional Non-Same Store as a result of a casualty event; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>five apartment communities with 1,727 apartment homes sold during the period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These decreases were offset by the addition of five apartment communities that were reclassified from Conventional Non-Same Store, including three acquisition communities with 818 apartment homes as we have now owned them for the entirety of both periods presented, and two redeveloped apartment communities with 443 apartment homes that were reclassified upon maintaining stabilized occupancy for the entirety of both periods presented.\nOur proportionate conventional portfolio results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental and other property revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>168,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>804,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>752,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>192,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>65,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>257,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property net operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>443,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>103,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>546,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, our conventional segment's proportionate property NOI increased $40.8 million, or 8.1%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, Conventional Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $25.9 million, or 6.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $28.5 million, or 4.7%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues (approximately $82 per effective home), comprised primarily of increases in rental rates of 4.0%. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2016, were 2.4% higher than expiring lease rates, and renewal rates were 5.7% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in Conventional Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $2.6 million, or 1.4%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, personnel costs and repairs and maintenance, partially offset by lower utilities expenses and insurance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $1.6 million, or 1.9%.\nOur Conventional Non-Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is attributable to the following:\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$7.8 million increase due to the NOI stabilization of three redeveloped communities (Lincoln Place, Ocean House on Prospect and Preserve at Marin);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$2.6 million due to completing lease-up of Vivo and nearing completion of the lease-up of Indigo and One Canal;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$3.4 million due to apartment communities we acquired during 2015; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$1.1 million due to other net increases in proportionate property NOI including the continued lease-up of redeveloped homes at Park Towne Place and The Sterling, offset by decreases due to apartment homes taken out of service for our current redevelopments.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, our conventional portfolio consisted of the following:\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>102 Conventional Same Store apartment communities with 31,422 apartment homes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>27 Conventional Non-Same Store apartment communities with 5,855 apartment homes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our proportionate conventional portfolio results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2015 (excluding amounts related to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale during 2016).\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental and other property revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>622,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>594,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,530\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>130,110\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>752,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>683,791\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>194,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>52,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>246,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>228,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property net operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>427,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>403,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>77,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>455,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, our conventional segment's proportionate property NOI increased $50.2 million, or 11.0%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, Conventional Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $23.8 million, or 5.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million, or 4.6%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues (approximately $78 per effective home), comprised of increases in rental rates, utility reimbursements and other fees, including parking. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2015, were 4.4% higher than expiring lease rates, and renewal rates were 5.5% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in Conventional Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $3.8 million, or 2.0%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and repairs and maintenance. During the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $2.0 million, or 2.3%.\nOur Conventional Non-Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. Proportionate property NOI increased $13.1 million due to apartment communities that we acquired in 2015 and 2014. Proportionate property NOI increased $13.3 million due to higher revenues per apartment home and higher average daily occupancy associated with apartment homes placed into service following completion of construction activities at Lincoln Place, Preserve at Marin and Pacific Bay Vistas, partially offset by a reduction in revenue associated with apartment homes taken out of service at our Park Towne Place and The Sterling redevelopments during 2015.\nAffordable Real Estate Operations\nOur affordable portfolio consists primarily of apartment communities that we manage that are owned through low-income housing tax credit partnerships. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our affordable portfolio consisted of 46 apartment communities with 7,610 apartment homes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, our affordable portfolio's proportionate property NOI increased $6.1 million, or 10.9%. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in rental income driven by higher rental rates, including market rate increases on four apartment communities that were approved in 2016 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, partially offset by higher personnel and repairs and maintenance costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, the proportionate property NOI of our affordable apartment communities increased $1.6 million, or 2.9%. The increase was attributable to an increase in rental income driven primarily by higher rental rates of $23 per month on apartment homes.\nNon-Segment Real Estate Operations\nReal estate operations NOI amounts not attributed to our conventional or affordable segments include offsite costs associated with property management and casualty losses, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, casualty losses totaled $5.8 million, $8.3 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, included claims related to fire damage, water damage resulting from a storm affecting several communities, and water damage resulting from damaged pipes at several other communities. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2015, included losses resulting from property damage and snow removal costs associated with the severe snow storms in the Northeast. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2014, included losses from the severe weather associated with the 2014 Polar Vortex,\u201d which affected many of our apartment communities in the Northeast and Midwest, as well as damage to one of our apartment communities resulting from a severe hail storm.\nTax Credit and Asset Management Revenues\nWe sponsor certain consolidated partnerships that acquire, develop and operate qualifying affordable housing apartment communities and are structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and deductions to their partners. We recognize income associated with the delivery of tax credits and deductions generated by these partnerships to their partners.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, tax credit and asset management revenues decreased $3.0 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to $6.6 million lower amortization of deferred tax credit income primarily due to delivery of substantially all of the tax credits on various apartment communities in prior periods, partially offset by a $3.6 million fee earned for assisting a third-party property owner in a mark-up-to-market renewal related to a property we previously owned.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, tax credit and asset management revenues decreased $7.2 million. This decrease was attributable to a decrease in amortization of deferred tax credit income primarily due to delivery of substantially all of the tax credits on various apartment communities during 2014 and 2015, and a decrease in disposition and other transactional fees earned in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nCertain of the apartment communities within our tax credit partnerships have delivered substantially all of the tax credits, or are anticipated to deliver substantially all of the tax credits during 2017. As the tax credit delivery and compliance periods for these apartment communities expire, amortization of deferred income associated with the delivery of tax credits and deductions will decrease. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we acquired an investor limited partner's interest in one of the tax credit partnerships prior to the end of the tax credit delivery period and as such we are no longer obligated to deliver tax credits. We expect amortization of deferred tax credit income to decrease from $17.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, to approximately $11 million for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nInvestment Management Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, investment management expenses decreased $1.5 million primarily due to lower acquisition-related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, investment management expenses decreased $1.5 million primarily due to increases in acquisition and other costs, partially offset by an increase in personnel and related costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, depreciation and amortization totaled $333.1 million, $306.3 million and $282.6 million, respectively. The $26.8 million increase from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to amounts placed in service as we completed apartment homes in our Park Towne Place and The Sterling redevelopments, the completion of our One Canal and Vivo developments, our acquisition of Indigo and other capital additions, partially offset by decreases associated with apartment communities sold. The $23.7 million increase from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to apartment homes placed into service as we completed our redevelopments and apartment communities we acquired in 2014 and 2015, partially offset by decreases associated with apartment communities sold.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nIn recent years, we have worked toward simplifying our business, including winding down the portion of our business that generates transaction-based activity fees and reducing the number of partnerships that own our conventional apartment communities by acquiring the noncontrolling interests in these partnerships, which allowed us to reduce overhead and other costs associated with these activities. These and other simplification activities, along with our scale reductions, have allowed us to reduce our offsite costs, which consist of general and administrative expenses, property management and investment management expenses, by $6.5 million, or 8.1%, over the last three years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses, excluding incentive compensation, decreased by approximately $0.2 million. Inclusive of incentive compensation, general and administrative expense increased $1.8 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation based on our performance against key performance indicators in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 2.1%, primarily due to reductions in personnel and related costs, partially offset by an increase in administrative costs, including travel and consulting costs.\nOther Expenses, Net\nOther expenses, net includes franchise taxes, costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses and certain non-recurring items.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, other expenses, net increased by $3.9 million. The increase was primarily due an increased estimate for future environmental costs, which is further discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, partially offset by lower legal and related costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, other expenses, net decreased by $4.0 million. The decrease was due to a $1.8 million provision for real estate impairment loss we recognized during the year ended December 31, 2014, related to the estimated costs to sell an apartment community, inclusive of prepayment penalties. The decrease was also due to lower legal and other costs as well as the favorable resolution of certain legal matters in 2015, partially offset by higher environmental costs associated with an apartment community we no longer own.\nInterest Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense, which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties incurred in financing activities, decreased by $3.3 million, or 1.7%. The decrease was primarily attributed to lower average outstanding balances from our repayment of non-recourse property debt and to a lesser extent from a lower average cost of debt on property loans refinanced during the year, resulting in an $8.1 million reduction in interest expense, and a $4.9 million reduction of interest expense on debt related to apartment community dispositions. These decreases were partially offset by increased interest expense on debt associated with apartment community acquisitions and on One Canal, the construction of which was completed during 2016 and for which we ceased interest capitalization, and higher average borrowings on our revolving credit facility.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense decreased by $21.3 million, or 9.6%. The decrease was primarily the result of lower average outstanding balances on non-recourse property debt for our existing apartment communities, decreases in property debt resulting from apartment community dispositions and higher prepayment penalties incurred in 2014. These decreases in interest expense were partially offset by increases related to our acquisition of apartment communities and on three of our redevelopments which reached completion of construction and therefore ceased capitalization of related interest expense.\nOther, Net\nOther, net includes our equity in the income or loss of unconsolidated real estate partnerships, and the results of operations related to our legacy asset management business, which we account for under the profit sharing method, as further discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, other, net primarily consisted of $5.6 million and $0.2 million of net income and $0.8 million of net losses, respectively, related to our legacy asset management business. The increase in net income of the legacy asset management business from 2015 to 2016 was primarily due to the 2016 gain on the derecognition of the net liabilities of a portion of the legacy asset management business, as further described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. After income taxes and noncontrolling interest allocations, our share of the net results of the legacy asset\nmanagement business totaled $4.4 million of net loss, $3.6 million of net income and $1.2 million of net loss for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nCertain of our operations or a portion thereof, including property management, asset management and risk management are conducted through TRS entities. Additionally, some of our apartment communities, including redevelopment communities, are owned through TRS entities. Income taxes related to the results of continuing operations of our TRS entities (before gains on dispositions) are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, income tax benefit decreased by $2.3 million, from $27.5 million to $25.2 million, primarily due to lower net losses recognized by apartment communities owned by our TRS entities, partially offset by higher historic tax credits associated with the redevelopment of certain apartment communities and utilization of low-income housing tax credits from our acquisition of the outside limited partner's interest in a tax credit partnership.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, income tax benefit increased by $7.5 million, from $20.0 million to $27.5 million, primarily due to the taxable income generated by our low-income housing tax credit business prior to the intercompany sale of this business in late 2014 to the Aimco Operating Partnership, and an increase in historic tax credits.\nBased on the ongoing simplification of our TRS entities, and lower planned investment in redevelopments eligible for historic tax credits, we anticipate a reduction in our income tax benefit during the year ending December 31, 2017, to a range of $19 million to $22 million.\nPrior to December 15, 2014, the interests in our low-income housing tax credit business were owned through TRS entities. On December 15, 2014, our TRS entities sold the interests held in our tax credit business to the Aimco Operating Partnership. Through the date of sale the income resulting from these interests was subject to income taxes. Subsequent to the sale of the tax credit business, the income resulting from interests held in the tax credit business will not result in federal income tax liability. In accordance with GAAP applicable to income tax accounting for intercompany transactions, net tax expense associated with the sale, totaling approximately $3.5 million, was deferred within our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale, and is being recognized in earnings as the assets of the tax credit business affect our GAAP income or loss, through depreciation, impairment losses, or sales to third-party entities. Refer to the Recent Accounting Pronouncements heading within Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of a change in accounting standards affecting the remaining deferred tax associated with this and other intercompany transactions.\nGain on Dispositions of Real Estate, Net of Tax\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold eight consolidated apartment communities for an aggregate sale price of $544.5 million, resulting in net proceeds of $524.2 million, and a net gain of $393.8 million (which is net of $6.4 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we sold 11 consolidated apartment communities for an aggregate sales price of $404.3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $229.4 million, and a net gain of $180.6 million (which is net of $1.8 million of related income taxes). During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold 30 consolidated apartment communities for an aggregate sales price of $735.6 million, resulting in net proceeds of $456.6 million and a net gain of approximately $288.6 million (which is net of $36.1 million of related income taxes).\nNOI capitalization rate and FCF capitalization rate are benchmarks used in the real estate industry for relative comparison of real estate valuations, including for apartment community sales, and are defined and further described under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below. The NOI and FCF capitalization rates for sales of our consolidated conventional apartment communities during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, were as follows:\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI capitalization rate\n</td> <td>5.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow capitalization rate\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe apartment communities sold during 2016, 2015 and 2014 were primarily outside of our target markets or in less desirable locations within our target markets and had average revenues per apartment home significantly below those of our retained portfolio. Accordingly, the NOI and FCF capitalization rates for these properties may not be indicative of those of our retained portfolio.\nNoncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Real Estate Partnerships\nNoncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships reflects the results of our consolidated real estate partnerships allocated to the owners who are not affiliated with Aimco. The amounts of income or loss of our consolidated real estate partnerships that we allocate to owners not affiliated with Aimco include their share of property management fees, interest on notes and other amounts that we charge to these partnerships.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we allocated net income of $25.3 million, $4.8 million, and $24.6 million, respectively, to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships. The amounts of net income allocated to noncontrolling interests were lower in 2015 relative to 2016 and 2014, primarily due to our derecognition of the noncontrolling interests in 2016 and recognition of deferred asset management fees in 2014 related to the legacy asset management business, as well as the allocation of gain on dispositions of real estate to noncontrolling interests.\nNet Income Attributable to Aimco Preferred Stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership's Preferred Unitholders\nNet income attributable to Aimco preferred stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership's preferred unitholders increased by $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. These increases were partly due to our July 2016 redemption of the Class Z preferred shares. In connection with the redemption, we wrote off previously deferred issuance costs of $1.3 million. Additionally, the $0.7 million excess of the redemption value over the carrying amount was reflected in the net income attributable to Aimco Preferred Stockholders and Aimco Operating Partnership's Preferred Unitholders. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in preferred dividends due to the timing of redemption of the Class Z preferred stock and our March 2015 redemption of Series A CRA Preferred Stock.\nNet income attributable to Aimco preferred stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership's preferred unitholders increased by $3.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases were primarily due to the issuance during May 2014 of $125.0 million of preferred securities with a 6.875% dividend/distribution rate, and were also partly attributable to the write-off of previously deferred issuance costs in connection with our March 2015 redemption of preferred securities. See Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of our preferred securities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nCapitalized Costs\nWe capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopments and developments, other tangible apartment community improvements and replacements of existing apartment community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by site employees in connection with the planning, execution and control of all capital additions activities at the apartment community level. We characterize as indirect costs\u201d an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital additions activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes and insurance during periods in which redevelopments and developments are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get apartment communities ready for their intended use begin. These activities include when apartment communities or apartment homes are undergoing physical construction, as well as when apartment homes are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the apartment communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and apartment homes are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred. Refer to the discussion of investing activities within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for a summary of costs capitalized during the periods presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nReal estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an apartment community may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the apartment community. If the carrying amount\nexceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the apartment community.\nAs part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell each year up to 10% of the apartment communities in our portfolio with lower projected FCF returns, and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in property upgrades and redevelopment of communities in our current portfolio, occasional development of new communities and selective acquisitions with projected FCF returns higher than expected for the communities sold. As we execute this strategy, we evaluate alternatives to sell or reduce our interest in apartment communities that do not align with our long-term investment strategy, although there is no assurance that we will sell or reduce our investment in such apartment communities during the desired time frame. For any apartment communities that are sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the next 12 months, the reduction in the estimated holding period for these apartment communities may result in impairment losses.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nVarious of the key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are non-GAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined and described below, and for those non-GAAP financial measures used or disclosed within this annual report, reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP are provided.\nFunds from Operations, Pro forma Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and further described below under the Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations heading.\nFCF, as calculated for our retained portfolio, represents an apartment community's property NOI, less spending for capital replacements, which represents our estimation of the capital additions made to replace capital assets consumed during our ownership period (further discussed under the Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations heading and the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading). FCF margin represents an apartment community's NOI less $1,200 per apartment home of assumed annual capital replacement spending, as a percentage of the apartment community's rental and other property revenues. Capital replacement spending is a method of measuring the cost of capital asset usage during the period; therefore we believe that FCF is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of apartment community performance because it takes into consideration costs incurred during the period to replace capital assets that have been consumed during our ownership.\nNOI capitalization rate and FCF capitalization rate are benchmarks used in the real estate industry for relative comparison of real estate valuations, including for apartment community sales. For purposes of calculating such capitalization rates for apartment community sales, NOI capitalization rate represents an apartment community's trailing twelve month NOI prior to sale, less a management fee equal to 3% of revenue, divided by gross proceeds. FCF capitalization rate represents an apartment community's NOI (as calculated for NOI capitalization rate) less $1,200 per apartment home of assumed annual capital replacement spending, divided by gross proceeds.\nFunds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations\nFunds From Operations, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers or other personal property. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable real estate, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis to determine FFO. We calculate FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting, if dilutive, redemption or repurchase related preferred stock issuance costs and dividends on preferred stock, and adding back dividends/distributions on dilutive preferred securities and premiums or discounts on preferred stock redemptions or repurchases.\nIn addition to FFO, we compute Pro forma FFO and Adjusted FFO, or AFFO, which are also non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are helpful to investors in understanding our performance. Pro forma FFO represents FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding preferred equity redemption-related amounts (adjusted for noncontrolling interests). Preferred equity redemption-related amounts (gains or losses) are items that periodically affect our operating results and we exclude these items from our calculation of Pro forma FFO because such amounts are not representative of our operating performance. AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements (also adjusted for noncontrolling interests), which represents our estimation of the capital additions made to replace capital assets consumed during our ownership period. When we make capital additions at an apartment community, we evaluate whether the additions enhance the value, profitability or useful life of\nan asset as compared to its condition at the time we purchased the apartment community. We classify as Capital Improvements those capital additions that meet these criteria and we classify as Capital Replacements those that do not. AFFO is a key financial indicator we use to evaluate our operational performance and is one of the factors that we use to determine the amounts of our dividend payments.\nFFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss), as determined in accordance with GAAP, as indications of our performance. Although we use these non-GAAP measures for comparability in assessing our performance compared to other REITs, not all REITs compute these same measures and those who do, may not compute them in the same manner. Additionally, computation of AFFO is subject to our definition of Capital Replacement spending. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other REITs.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, Aimco's FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO are calculated as follows (in thousands):\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Aimco common stockholders (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>300,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization, net of noncontrolling partners' interest\n</td> <td>314,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>288,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on dispositions and other, net of noncontrolling partners' interest\n</td> <td>(381,131\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(174,797\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(299,219\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision related to gain on disposition of real estate\n</td> <td>6,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common noncontrolling interests in Aimco Operating Partnership's share of above adjustments (2)\n</td> <td>2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,548\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(777\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amounts allocable to participating securities\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders -

The increases were partially offset by the loss of income from apartment communities that were sold in 2016 and 2015 and a lower income tax benefit due to the simplification of our TRS entities. For the same period, AFFO increased 5% (on a diluted per share basis), primarily as a result of the Pro forma FFO growth.\nThe Aimco Operating Partnership does not separately compute or report FFO, Pro forma FFO or AFFO. However, based on Aimco's method for allocation of such amounts to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, as well as the limited differences between Aimco's and the Aimco Operating Partnership's net income amounts during the periods presented, FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO amounts on a per unit basis for the Aimco Operating Partnership would be expected to be substantially the same as the corresponding per share amounts for Aimco.\nEconomic Income\nEconomic Income represents the change in estimated NAV, per share plus cash dividends per share. We believe Economic Income is important to investors as it represents a measure of the total return we have earned for our stockholders. NAV, as used in our calculation of Economic Income, is a non-GAAP measure and represents the estimated fair value of assets net of liabilities attributable to Aimco's common stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership's common unitholders on a diluted basis. We believe NAV is considered useful by some investors in valuing shares in public real estate companies because it seeks to value the assets held by public companies in a manner similar to those values established in private transactions. Our estimated NAV per share and the quoted share price of Aimco Common Stock are not necessarily equal.\nWe estimate NAV on a semiannual basis, as of the end of the first and third quarters. Economic Income for 2016, was calculated using the change in NAV per share between September 30, 2015 and 2016. NAV will fluctuate over time. This NAV information should not be relied upon as representative of the amount a stockholder could expect to receive in a liquidation event, now or in the future. Certain assets are excluded as are certain liabilities such as taxes and transaction costs associated with a liquidation. In addition, NAV is based on management's subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions as of the date of determination. We assume no obligation to revise or update NAV to reflect subsequent or future events or circumstances. Our NAV estimate is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nA reconciliation of NAV to total equity, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided below (in millions, except per share data):\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>September 30, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total equity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value adjustment for real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less: real estate, at depreciated cost\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,756\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Plus: fair value of real estate (1)\n</td> <td>12,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment to present real estate at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value adjustment for total indebtedness\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Plus: total indebtedness, net\n</td> <td>4,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less: fair value of indebtedness (2)\n</td> <td>(3,851\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Adjustment to present indebtedness at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments to present other tangible assets, liabilities and preferred equity at fair value (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total shares, units and dilutive share equivalents (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated NAV per weighted average common share and unit - diluted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We compute NAV by estimating the value of our conventional communities and our affordable apartment communities that are not held through low-income housing tax credit partnerships using a variety of methods we believe are appropriate based on the characteristics of the communities, including applying market-based capitalization rates published by a third party to annualized apartment community NOI for the most recent quarter; discounted projected future cash flows; and contract price for apartment communities scheduled for sale.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>We calculate the fair value of our debt based on the money-weighted average interest rate on our debt, which rate takes into account the timing of amortization and maturities, and a market rate that takes into account the duration of the property debt as well as loan-to-value and coverage ratios.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Other tangible assets and liabilities were generally valued at their carrying amounts and reduced by the noncontrolling interests' portion of these amounts and exclude intangible assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet.

We believe these ratios are important measures as they are commonly used by investors and analysts to assess the relative financial risk associated with balance sheets of companies within the same industry, and they are believed to be similar to measures used by rating agencies to assess entity credit quality.\nProportionate Debt, as used in our leverage ratios, is a non-GAAP measure and represents our share of the debt obligations recognized in our consolidated financial statements, as well as our share of the debt obligations of our unconsolidated partnerships, reduced by our share of the cash and restricted cash of our consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships, and also by our investment in the subordinate tranches of a securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt (essentially, our investment in our own non-recourse property loans).\nIn our Proportionate Debt computation, we increase our recorded debt by unamortized debt issue costs because these amounts represent cash expended in earlier periods and do not reduce our contractual obligations, and we reduce our recorded debt obligations by the amounts of cash and restricted cash on-hand (such restricted cash amounts being primarily restricted under the terms of our property debt agreements), assuming these amounts would be used to reduce our outstanding leverage. We further reduce our recorded debt obligations by the value of our investment in a securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, as our payments of principal and interest associated with such property debt will ultimately repay our investments in the trust. We believe Proportionate Debt is useful to investors as it is a measure of our net exposure to debt obligations. Proportionate Debt, as used in our leverage ratios, is calculated as set forth in the table below.\nPreferred Equity, as used in our leverage ratios, represents the redemption amounts for Aimco's preferred stock and the Aimco Operating Partnership's preferred OP Units. Preferred Equity, although perpetual in nature, is another component of our overall leverage.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors relevant and useful information because it allows investors to view income from our operations on an unleveraged basis, before the effects of taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on sales of and impairment losses related to real estate and various other items described below.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents Aimco's share of the consolidated amount of our net income, adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items for the reasons set forth below:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest expense, preferred dividends and interest income we earn on our investment in the subordinate tranches of a securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, to allow investors to compare a measure of our performance before the effects of our capital structure with that of other companies in the real estate industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>income taxes, to allow investors to measure our performance independent of income taxes, which may vary significantly from other companies within our industry due to leverage and tax planning strategies, among other considerations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on dispositions and impairment losses related to real estate, for reasons similar to those set forth in our discussion of FFO, Pro forma FFO and AFFO in the preceding section; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other items, including gains on dispositions of non-depreciable assets, as these are items that periodically affect our operations but that are not necessarily representative of our ongoing ability to service our debt obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> While Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure of performance and is commonly used in leverage ratios, it does not represent net income as defined by GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to net income in evaluating our performance. Further, our definition and computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted Interest Expense, as calculated in our leverage ratios, is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is meaningful for investors and analysts as it presents our share of current recurring interest requirements associated with leverage. Our calculation of Adjusted Interest Expense is set forth in the table below. We exclude from our calculation of Adjusted Interest Expense:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>debt prepayment penalties, which are items that, from time to time, affect our operating results, but are not representative of our scheduled interest obligations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amortization of debt issue costs, as these amounts have been expended in previous periods and are not representative of our current or prospective debt service requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the income we receive on our investment in the securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, as this income is being generated indirectly from interest we pay with respect to property debt held by the trust.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Preferred Dividends represents the preferred dividends paid on Aimco's preferred stock and the preferred distributions paid on the Aimco Operating Partnership's preferred OP Units, exclusive of preferred equity redemption related amounts. We add Preferred Dividends to Adjusted Interest Expense for a more complete picture of the interest and dividend requirements of our leverage, inclusive of perpetual preferred equity.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, reconciliations of the most closely related GAAP measures to our calculations of Proportionate Debt, Preferred Equity, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Interest Expense and

Additional sources are proceeds from sales of apartment communities, proceeds from refinancings of existing property debt, borrowings under new property debt, borrowings under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from equity offerings.\nOur principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding property debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners and acquisitions of apartment communities. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short-term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short-term liquidity needs, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability and proceeds from apartment community sales and refinancings. We may use our revolving credit facility for working capital and other short-term purposes, such as funding investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities and apartment community acquisitions, through long-term borrowings (primarily non-recourse), the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of apartment communities and cash generated from operations.\nThe availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. However, any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We believe we have mitigated much of this exposure by reducing our short and intermediate term maturity risk through refinancing such loans with long-dated, fixed-rate property debt. However, if property financing options become unavailable for our further debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or proceeds from apartment community dispositions.\nOur investment grade rating would be useful to access capital through the sale of bonds in private or public transactions. However, our intention and historical practice has been to raise debt capital in the form of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt, the cost of which is generally less than that of recourse debt and the terms of which also provide for greater balance sheet safety.\nAt December 31, 2016, approximately 94% of our leverage consisted of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, amortizing debt and 6% consisted of perpetual preferred equity. The weighted average maturity of our property-level debt was 8.0 years, with $260.2 million of our unpaid principal balances maturing during 2017. On average, 8.6% of our unpaid principal balances will mature each year from 2018 through 2020. Approximately 98% of our property-level debt is fixed-rate, which provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, capitalization rates and inflation.\nOur primary source of leverage is property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt. We also have a Credit Agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that provides for $600.0 million of revolving loan commitments, which we use for working capital and other short-term purposes. At December 31, 2016, we had $17.9 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and we had the right to borrow an additional $570.3 million, after consideration of the outstanding borrowings and $11.8 million for undrawn letters of credit backed by the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides us with an option to expand the aggregate loan commitments, subject to customary conditions, by up to $200.0 million. Our borrowings\nunder the Credit Agreement represented less than 1% of our total leverage as of December 31, 2016 and the interest rate on our outstanding borrowings was 2.09% at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our outstanding perpetual preferred equity represented approximately 6% of our total leverage. Our preferred securities are perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, we compute the weighted average maturity of our total leverage assuming a 40-year maturity on our preferred securities.\nThe combination of non-recourse property level debt, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and perpetual preferred equity that comprises our total leverage, reduces our refunding and re-pricing risk. The weighted average maturity for our total leverage described above was 9.8 years as of December 31, 2016.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we have agreed to maintain Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.40x, as well as other covenants customary for similar revolving credit arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was 1.96x, compared to ratio of 1.89x for the year ended December 31, 2015. We expect to remain in compliance with this covenant during the next 12 months.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $61.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $69.9 million of restricted cash, an increase of $10.5 million and a decrease of $17.1 million, respectively, from December 31, 2015. Restricted cash primarily consists of reserves and escrows held by lenders for bond sinking funds, capital additions, property taxes and insurance and escrows related to resident security deposits. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $700 million of cash and restricted cash on hand and credit available on our Credit Agreement.\nThe following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8 of this report.\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash provided by operating activities of $377.7 million was primarily related to operating income from our consolidated apartment communities, which is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment communities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $17.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to improved operating results of our conventional portfolio, including increased contribution from redevelopment and development apartment communities and a decrease in cash paid for interest primarily due to repayment of non-recourse property debt. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a decrease in the NOI associated with apartment communities we sold during 2016 and 2015.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash used in investing activities of $97.8 million consisted primarily of our purchase of Indigo and other capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of apartment communities. We funded a portion of our purchase of Indigo with $25 million in nonrefundable deposits provided to the seller in 2015 and a portion was funded at closing through the issuance of $17 million of preferred OP units. The balance of the purchase was funded through a combination of proceeds from non-recourse property debt and from the sale of apartment communities.\nCapital expenditures totaled $346.6 million, $367.2 million and $367.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities and cash proceeds from apartment community sales.\nWe categorize our capital spending broadly into six primary categories:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital replacements, which represent capital additions made to replace the portion of acquired apartment communities consumed during our period of ownership;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital improvements, which are

our redevelopments, the majority of which related to six apartment communities detailed on the following table, and we invested $31.8 million in development, which primarily related to the completion

Stabilization represents the period in which we expect the communities to achieve stabilized rents and operating costs, generally five quarters after occupancy stabilization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $85.2 million in the ongoing redevelopment of Park Towne Place and The Sterling, mixed-use communities located in Center City Philadelphia. We are redeveloping three of the four towers at Park Towne Place, one at a time, and at December 31, 2016, had completed 468 of the 701 apartment homes being redeveloped. We completed lease-up of the homes in the South Tower and 70% of the apartment homes in the East Tower were leased at rental rates consistent with underwriting. Based on the success of the first two towers, we commenced redevelopment of the North Tower during 2016. We will continue to evaluate the success of the redevelopment and may redevelop the fourth tower in the community.\nWe are redeveloping The Sterling, a 30-story building, two or three floors at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed redevelopment of 472 of the 534 apartment homes in The Sterling on schedule and at a cost consistent with underwriting. We had leased 92% of the completed homes at rental rates in line with underwriting.\nDuring 2016, we began redevelopment of four communities with an aggregate expected net investment of approximately $81.4 million. These redevelopments consist of the following:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Bay Parc Plaza, a 471 apartment home community located in Miami, Florida.

The redevelopment also includes enhancements to the corridors on these floors.

Lease-up is nearing completion, with 86% of the apartment homes occupied at December 31, 2016, at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nWe expect our total redevelopment and development spending to range from $100 million to $200 million for the year ending December 31, 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash used in financing activities of $269.5 million was primarily attributed to principal payments on property loans, dividends paid to common security holders, distributions paid to noncontrolling interests and redemptions of preferred stock, partially offset by proceeds from non-recourse property debt.\nPrincipal payments on property loans during the year totaled $371.9 million, consisting of $79.6 million of scheduled principal amortization and repayments of $292.3 million. Proceeds from non-recourse property debt borrowings during the period consisted of the closing of $393.5 million fixed-rate, amortizing, non-recourse property loans with a weighted average term of 9.4 years, in addition to $24.2 million for construction draws related to One Canal. We like the discipline of financing our investments in real estate through the use of amortizing, fixed-rate non-recourse property debt, as the amortization gradually reduces our leverage, reduces our refunding risk and the fixed-rate provides a hedge against increases in interest rates.\nEquity and Partners' Capital Transactions\nThe following table presents our dividend and distribution activity, which is included in our net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions paid by the Aimco Operating Partnership to holders of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions paid by the Aimco Operating Partnership to preferred unitholders (1)\n</td> <td>17,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions paid by the Aimco Operating Partnership to common unitholders (2)\n</td> <td>216,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash distributions paid by the Aimco Operating Partnership\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions paid by Aimco to holders of noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash distributions paid by Aimco to holders of OP Units\n</td> <td>17,453\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividends paid by Aimco to preferred stockholders\n</td> <td>10,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash dividends paid by Aimco to common stockholders\n</td> <td>206,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash dividends and distributions paid by Aimco\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>$10.0 million represented distributions to Aimco, and $7.2 million represented distributions paid to holders of OP Units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>$206.3 million represented distributions to Aimco, and $10.2 million represented distributions paid to holders of OP Units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to an At-The-Market offering program active at December 31, 2016, Aimco has the capacity to issue up to 3.5 million shares of its Common Stock.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Overview\nWe are focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment and limited development of quality apartment communities diversified by geography in the largest coastal and job growth markets in the United States and also diversified across price points.\nOur principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our equity holders, as measured by growth in Economic Income and Adjusted Funds From Operations. Economic Income is our measure of total return and Adjusted Funds From Operations is our measure of current return. In 2016, Economic Income totaled approximately $7 per share, representing a 15% return on our estimated net asset value at the beginning of that measurement period. Adjusted Funds From Operations was $1.97 per share, an increase of 5% as compared to 2015. Our calculation of Economic Income relies upon net asset value, or NAV. NAV and Adjusted Funds From Operations are non-GAAP measures and are defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nOur business and strategic areas of focus are described in more detail within the Business Overview in Item 1. Execution of our goals within our strategic areas of focus drove solid results for Aimco in 2016, as further described in the sections that follow.\nProperty Operations\nWe own and operate a portfolio of conventional apartment communities, diversified by both geography and price point. At December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio included 134 apartment communities with 37,922 apartment homes in which we held an average ownership of approximately 97%. We also operate a portfolio of affordable apartment communities, which primarily consists of communities owned through low-income housing tax credit partnerships, and with rents generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Consolidated apartment communities that we manage within our conventional and affordable portfolios comprise our reportable segments and generated 90% and 10%, respectively, of our proportionate property net operating income, or NOI, (defined below under the Results of Operations - Property Operations heading) during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn our conventional same store portfolio, revenue and expense grew 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively, leading to 6.2% growth in property net operating income. Revenue growth was due to a weighted average rent increase of 4.0% and an average daily occupancy of 95.9%, which was consistent with 2015. We focus on customer satisfaction and resident retention, which results in lower resident turnover and reduces vacancy related costs. We receive approximately 90,000 customer satisfaction surveys annually and achieved an average rating of 4.18 (on a 1 to 5 scale) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur focus on efficient operations through centralization of administrative tasks, optimization of economies of scale at the corporate level and investment in more durable, longer-lived materials has helped us control operating expenses. As a result of these efforts, our conventional same store controllable operating expenses, which we define as property level operating expenses before real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, had a compound annual growth rate of 2.1% over the last three years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio provided 68% operating margins and 62% free cash flow, or FCF, margins. FCF is defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nRedevelopment and Development\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $155.4 million in redevelopment, $85.2 million of which related to the ongoing redevelopment of Park Towne Place and The Sterling, mixed-use communities located in Center City Philadelphia. We are redeveloping the three of the four towers at Park Towne Place, one at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed lease-up of the South Tower and had leased 70% of the apartment homes in the East Tower. Rental rates are consistent with underwriting. Based on the success of the first two towers, we commenced redevelopment of the North Tower during 2016, completing de-leasing in the third quarter and starting construction in the fourth quarter. We will continue to evaluate the success of the redevelopment and may redevelop the fourth tower in the community.\nWe are redeveloping The Sterling, a 30-story building, two or three floors at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed 88% of the apartment homes, of which 92% had been leased. Rental rates are in line with underwriting. Three floors, representing 12% of the homes, and 37,000 square feet of commercial space remain under construction with anticipated completion in second quarter 2017.\nDuring 2016, we commenced four additional redevelopments with an estimated net investment of $81.4 million. These redevelopments include: Bay Parc Plaza in Miami, Florida; Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California; Yorktown in suburban Chicago; and the second phase of redevelopment at The Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles, California. For additional information regarding these redevelopments, please refer to the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading below.\nDuring 2016, we achieved NOI stabilization at three redeveloped apartment communities in California, Lincoln Place in Venice, Ocean House on Prospect in La Jolla and Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera. The redevelopment of these apartment communities resulted in value creation of approximately $170.0 million, or about 30% of our $582.0 million investment in these projects.\nDuring 2016, we invested $31.8 million in development, primarily in the completion of One Canal in Boston. Lease-up is nearing completion, with 86% of the apartment homes occupied at December 31, 2016, a pace well ahead of schedule and at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nDuring 2016, our Vivo community in Cambridge, Massachusetts achieved stabilized occupancy two months ahead of schedule with rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nSee below under the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Redevelopment and Development heading for additional information regarding our ongoing redevelopments at December 31, 2016.\nPortfolio Management\nOur portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of apartment communities that is diversified across A,\u201d B,\u201d and C+\u201d price points, averaging B/B+\u201d in quality, and that is diversified across the largest coastal and job growth markets in the U.S. We measure conventional apartment community quality based on average rents of our apartment homes compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis. Under this rating system, we classify as A\u201d quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than 125% of the local market average, as B\u201d quality apartment communities those earning rents between 90% and 125% of the local market average; as C+\u201d quality apartment communities those with rents greater than $1,100 per month, but lower than 90% of local market average; and as C\u201d quality apartment communities those with rents less than $1,100 per month and lower than 90% of local market average. We classify as B/B+\u201d quality a portfolio that on average earns rents between 100% and 125% of the local market average rents where the portfolio is located. Although some companies and analysts within the multifamily real estate industry use apartment community quality ratings of A,\u201d B\u201d and C,\u201d some of which are tied to local market rent averages, the metrics used to classify apartment community quality as well as the timing for which local markets rents are calculated may vary from company to company.\nAccordingly, our rating system for measuring apartment community quality is neither broadly nor consistently used in the multifamily real estate industry.\nAs part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell each year up to 10% of the apartment communities in our portfolio with lower projected free cash flow returns and invest the proceeds from such sales through property upgrades and redevelopment of communities in our current portfolio, occasional development of new communities and selective acquisition of apartment communities with projected free cash flow returns higher than expected from the communities sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, we have significantly increased the quality and expected growth rate of our portfolio as evidenced by increased average revenue per apartment home for the portfolio and higher average rents compared to local market average rents.\n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio average revenue per effective apartment home was $1,978, an increase of 34.6% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to rent growth from the improved quality of our portfolio, driven in part by the sale of conventional apartment communities during these periods with average monthly revenues per effective apartment home substantially lower than those of the retained portfolio, and also by our reinvestment of the sales proceeds through redevelopment, development and acquisition of apartment communities with higher rents and better free cash flow return prospects.\nAfter several years of above-trend rent growth, we are seeing rent growth in many markets decelerate due to competitive new supply. As a result of our diversification by both geography and price point, our exposure to competitive new supply is largely limited to approximately one quarter of our portfolio, represented by A\u201d price point communities in submarkets with more than 2% supply growth projected over the next year. This exposure is mitigated in some submarkets where the rate of job growth exceeds the rate of supply growth, and in other submarkets where our A\u201d rents are substantially lower than the rents charged by new supply.\nAs we execute our portfolio strategy, we expect to increase conventional portfolio average revenue per apartment home at a rate greater than market rent growth; increase FCF margins; and increase the percentage of our conventional property net operating income earned in our target markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven conventional apartment communities with 3,045 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $517.0 million. After payment of transaction costs, working capital adjustments and distributions to noncontrolling interests, our share of the net proceeds totaled $509.1 million. We sold one apartment community from our low-income housing tax credit portfolio for gross proceeds of $27.5 million. After repayment of property debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to noncontrolling interests, our share of the net proceeds totaled $10.3 million. We invested these proceeds in redevelopment and development discussed below, as well as the acquisition for $320 million of Indigo, a 463-home apartment community in Redwood City, California that was in the final stages of construction at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, leasing was well ahead of schedule, with 77% of apartment homes occupied at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOur leverage strategy seeks to increase financial returns while using leverage with appropriate caution. We target the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA to be below 7.0x and we target the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x. We also focus on the ratios of Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense. Proportionate Debt, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Interest Expense, as used in these ratios, are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and reconciled under the Non-GAAP Measures - Leverage Ratios heading below. Preferred Equity represents Aimco's preferred stock and the Aimco Operating\nPartnership's preferred OP units. Our leverage ratios for the trailing twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, are presented below:\n\nWe expect future leverage reduction from earnings growth, especially as apartment communities now being redeveloped are completed and the lease-up of Indigo is completed, and from regularly scheduled property debt amortization funded from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2016, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair value of approximately $1.6 billion.\nTwo credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness, using different methodologies and ratios for assessing our credit. In 2015, both of these agencies upgraded our credit rating and outlook to BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Although some of the ratios they use are similar to those we use to measure our leverage, there are differences in our methods of calculation and therefore our leverage ratios disclosed above are not indicative of the ratios that may be calculated by these agencies.\nDuring 2016, we closed fixed-rate, non-recourse, amortizing, property loans totaling $393.5 million with a weighted average term of 9.4 years and weighted average interest rate of 3.2%, which were on average 145 basis points over the corresponding Treasury rates at the time of pricing. During 2016, we also amended our $600.0 million revolving credit facility, extending its maturity to January 2022. For additional information regarding our leverage, please see the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading.\nCulture\nOur culture is the key to our success. Our emphasis on a collaborative, respectful, and performance-oriented culture is what enables the continuing transformation of the Aimco business. In 2016, Aimco was recognized by the Denver Post as a Top Work Place for the fourth consecutive year. We were one of only three mid-size companies to be named a Top Work Place in Colorado for the past four consecutive years.\nKey Financial Indicators\nThe key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our operating performance are Economic Income, our measure of total return, and Adjusted Funds From Operations, our measure of current return. In addition to these indicators, we evaluate our operating performance and financial condition using: Pro forma Funds From Operations; FCF capitalization rate; NOI capitalization rate; same store property operating results; proportionate property NOI; average revenue per effective apartment home; financial coverage ratios; and net leverage. Certain of these financial indicators are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined, further described and, for certain of the measures, reconciled to comparable GAAP-based measures, under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nResults of Operations\nBecause our operating results depend primarily on income from our apartment communities, the supply of and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our apartment communities and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment communities affect our operating results.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nOverview\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership increased by $181.7 million and $190.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in income was principally due to an increase in gains on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from redeveloped and developed apartment communities placed into service during 2016 and from recent acquisitions.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership decreased by $60.5 million and $64.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in income was principally due to a decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by the effect of various other items discussed below.\nThe following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of operations of Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership in more detail.\nProperty Operations\nAs described under the preceding Executive Overview heading, our owned real estate portfolio consists primarily of conventional apartment communities. We also operate a portfolio of affordable apartment communities, the majority of which are held in low-income housing tax credit partnerships. Our conventional and affordable real estate operations that we manage and that are not classified as held for sale at the end of the current period comprise our reportable segments.\nDue to the range of our economic ownership interests in our apartment communities, we use proportionate property NOI to assess the operating performance of our apartment communities and our operating segments. Proportionate property NOI reflects our share of rental and other property revenues reduced by direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes, for the consolidated apartment communities that we manage. Accordingly, the results of operations of our conventional and affordable segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four conventional apartment communities with 142 apartment homes and eight affordable apartment communities with 727 apartment homes that we do not manage and one affordable community with 52 apartment homes that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016.\nWe do not include property management revenues, offsite costs associated with property management or casualty-related amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. Refer to Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reportable segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.\nConventional Real Estate Operations\nOur Conventional segment consists of apartment communities we classify as Conventional Same Store and Conventional Non-Same Store. Conventional Same Store apartment communities are those that have reached stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of a two year comparable period and maintained it throughout the current and comparable prior year, and that are not expected to be sold within 12 months. Conventional Non-Same Store consists of conventional redevelopment and development apartment communities, which are those currently under construction that are not occupancy stabilized and those that have been completed in recent years that had not achieved and maintained stabilized occupancy for both the current and comparable prior year, and conventional acquisition apartment communities, which are those we have acquired since the beginning of a two year comparable period. Conventional Non-Same Store also includes apartment communities subject to agreements that limit the amount by which we may increase rents; apartment communities that had not reached or maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of the beginning of a two year comparable period, often due to a casualty event; and apartment communities expected to be sold within 12 months but do not yet meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as defined by our segment performance metrics, our conventional portfolio consisted of the following:\n \u2022 101 Conventional Same Store apartment communities with 30,893 apartment homes; and \n \u2022 29 Conventional Non-Same Store apartment communities with 6,887 apartment homes. \nFrom December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, on a net basis, our Conventional Same Store portfolio decreased by six apartment communities and 2,256 apartment homes. This change consisted of:\n \u2022 five conventional redevelopment apartment communities with 1,544 apartment homes that were reclassified into Conventional Non-Same Store; \n \u2022 one apartment community with 246 apartment homes reclassified into Conventional Non-Same Store as a result of a casualty event; and \n \u2022 five apartment communities with 1,727 apartment homes sold during the period.  These decreases were offset by the addition of five apartment communities that were reclassified from Conventional Non-Same Store, including three acquisition communities with 818 apartment homes as we have now owned them for the entirety of both periods presented, and two redeveloped apartment communities with 443 apartment homes that were reclassified upon maintaining stabilized occupancy for the entirety of both periods presented.\nOur proportionate conventional portfolio results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2016.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, our conventional segment's proportionate property NOI increased $40.8 million, or 8.1%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, Conventional Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $25.9 million, or 6.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $28.5 million, or 4.7%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues (approximately $82 per effective home), comprised primarily of increases in rental rates of 4.0%. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2016, were 2.4% higher than expiring lease rates, and renewal rates were 5.7% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in Conventional Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $2.6 million, or 1.4%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, personnel costs and repairs and maintenance, partially offset by lower utilities expenses and insurance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $1.6 million, or 1.9%.\nOur Conventional Non-Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is attributable to the following:\n \u2022 $7.8 million increase due to the NOI stabilization of three redeveloped communities (Lincoln Place, Ocean House on Prospect and Preserve at Marin); \n \u2022 $2.6 million due to completing lease-up of Vivo and nearing completion of the lease-up of Indigo and One Canal; \n \u2022 $3.4 million due to apartment communities we acquired during 2015; and \n \u2022 $1.1 million due to other net increases in proportionate property NOI including the continued lease-up of redeveloped homes at Park Towne Place and The Sterling, offset by decreases due to apartment homes taken out of service for our current redevelopments. \nAs of December 31, 2015, our conventional portfolio consisted of the following:\n \u2022 102 Conventional Same Store apartment communities with 31,422 apartment homes; and \n \u2022 27 Conventional Non-Same Store apartment communities with 5,855 apartment homes.  Our proportionate conventional portfolio results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2015 (excluding amounts related to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale during 2016).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, our conventional segment's proportionate property NOI increased $50.2 million, or 11.0%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, Conventional Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $23.8 million, or 5.9%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million, or 4.6%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues (approximately $78 per effective home), comprised of increases in rental rates, utility reimbursements and other fees, including parking. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2015, were 4.4% higher than expiring lease rates, and renewal rates were 5.5% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in Conventional Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $3.8 million, or 2.0%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and repairs and maintenance. During the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $2.0 million, or 2.3%.\nOur Conventional Non-Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. Proportionate property NOI increased $13.1 million due to apartment communities that we acquired in 2015 and 2014. Proportionate property NOI increased $13.3 million due to higher revenues per apartment home and higher average daily occupancy associated with apartment homes placed into service following completion of construction activities at Lincoln Place, Preserve at Marin and Pacific Bay Vistas, partially offset by a reduction in revenue associated with apartment homes taken out of service at our Park Towne Place and The Sterling redevelopments during 2015.\nAffordable Real Estate Operations\nOur affordable portfolio consists primarily of apartment communities that we manage that are owned through low-income housing tax credit partnerships. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our affordable portfolio consisted of 46 apartment communities with 7,610 apartment homes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, our affordable portfolio's proportionate property NOI increased $6.1 million, or 10.9%. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in rental income driven by higher rental rates, including market rate increases on four apartment communities that were approved in 2016 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, partially offset by higher personnel and repairs and maintenance costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, the proportionate property NOI of our affordable apartment communities increased $1.6 million, or 2.9%. The increase was attributable to an increase in rental income driven primarily by higher rental rates of $23 per month on apartment homes.\nNon-Segment Real Estate Operations\nReal estate operations NOI amounts not attributed to our conventional or affordable segments include offsite costs associated with property management and casualty losses, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, casualty losses totaled $5.8 million, $8.3 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, included claims related to fire damage, water damage resulting from a storm affecting several communities, and water damage resulting from damaged pipes at several other communities. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2015, included losses resulting from property damage and snow removal costs associated with the severe snow storms in the Northeast. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2014, included losses from the severe weather associated with the 2014 Polar Vortex,\u201d which affected many of our apartment communities in the Northeast and Midwest, as well as damage to one of our apartment communities resulting from a severe hail storm.\nTax Credit and Asset Management Revenues\nWe sponsor certain consolidated partnerships that acquire, develop and operate qualifying affordable housing apartment communities and are structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and deductions to their partners. We recognize income associated with the delivery of tax credits and deductions generated by these partnerships to their partners.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, tax credit and asset management revenues decreased $3.0 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to $6.6 million lower amortization of deferred tax credit income primarily due to delivery of substantially all of the", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nExecutive Overview\nWe are focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment and limited development of quality apartment communities diversified by geography in the largest coastal and job growth markets in the United States and also diversified across price points.\nOur principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our equity holders, as measured by growth in Economic Income and Adjusted Funds From Operations. Economic Income is our measure of total return and Adjusted Funds From Operations is our measure of current return. In 2016, Economic Income totaled approximately $7 per share, representing a 15% return on our estimated net asset value at the beginning of that measurement period. Adjusted Funds From Operations was $1.97 per share, an increase of 5% as compared to 2015. Our calculation of Economic Income relies upon net asset value, or NAV. NAV and Adjusted Funds From Operations are non-GAAP measures and are defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nOur business and strategic areas of focus are described in more detail within the Business Overview in Item 1. Execution of our goals within our strategic areas of focus drove solid results for Aimco in 2016, as further described in the sections that follow.\nProperty Operations\nWe own and operate a portfolio of conventional apartment communities, diversified by both geography and price point. At December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio included 134 apartment communities with 37,922 apartment homes in which we held an average ownership of approximately 97%. We also operate a portfolio of affordable apartment communities, which primarily consists of communities owned through low-income housing tax credit partnerships, and with rents generally paid, in whole or part, by a government agency. Consolidated apartment communities that we manage within our conventional and affordable portfolios comprise our reportable segments and generated 90% and 10%, respectively, of our proportionate property net operating income, or NOI, (defined below under the Results of Operations - Property Operations heading) during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn our conventional same store portfolio, revenue and expense grew 4.7% and 1.4%, respectively, leading to 6.2% growth in property net operating income. Revenue growth was due to a weighted average rent increase of 4.0% and an average daily occupancy of 95.9%, which was consistent with 2015. We focus on customer satisfaction and resident retention, which results in lower resident turnover and reduces vacancy related costs. We receive approximately 90,000 customer satisfaction surveys annually and achieved an average rating of 4.18 (on a 1 to 5 scale) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOur focus on efficient operations through centralization of administrative tasks, optimization of economies of scale at the corporate level and investment in more durable, longer-lived materials has helped us control operating expenses. As a result of these efforts, our conventional same store controllable operating expenses, which we define as property level operating expenses before real estate taxes, insurance and utilities, had a compound annual growth rate of 2.1% over the last three years.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio provided 68% operating margins and 62% free cash flow, or FCF, margins. FCF is defined under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nRedevelopment and Development\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested $155.4 million in redevelopment, $85.2 million of which related to the ongoing redevelopment of Park Towne Place and The Sterling, mixed-use communities located in Center City Philadelphia. We are redeveloping the three of the four towers at Park Towne Place, one at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed lease-up of the South Tower and had leased 70% of the apartment homes in the East Tower. Rental rates are consistent with underwriting. Based on the success of the first two towers, we commenced redevelopment of the North Tower during 2016, completing de-leasing in the third quarter and starting construction in the fourth quarter. We will continue to evaluate the success of the redevelopment and may redevelop the fourth tower in the community.\nWe are redeveloping The Sterling, a 30-story building, two or three floors at a time, and at December 31, 2016, we had completed 88% of the apartment homes, of which 92% had been leased. Rental rates are in line with underwriting. Three floors, representing 12% of the homes, and 37,000 square feet of commercial space remain under construction with anticipated completion in second quarter 2017.\nDuring 2016, we commenced four additional redevelopments with an estimated net investment of $81.4 million. These redevelopments include: Bay Parc Plaza in Miami, Florida; Saybrook Pointe in San Jose, California; Yorktown in suburban Chicago; and the second phase of redevelopment at The Palazzo at Park La Brea in Los Angeles, California. For additional information regarding these redevelopments, please refer to the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading below.\nDuring 2016, we achieved NOI stabilization at three redeveloped apartment communities in California, Lincoln Place in Venice, Ocean House on Prospect in La Jolla and Preserve at Marin in Corte Madera. The redevelopment of these apartment communities resulted in value creation of approximately $170.0 million, or about 30% of our $582.0 million investment in these projects.\nDuring 2016, we invested $31.8 million in development, primarily in the completion of One Canal in Boston. Lease-up is nearing completion, with 86% of the apartment homes occupied at December 31, 2016, a pace well ahead of schedule and at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nDuring 2016, our Vivo community in Cambridge, Massachusetts achieved stabilized occupancy two months ahead of schedule with rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nSee below under the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Redevelopment and Development heading for additional information regarding our ongoing redevelopments at December 31, 2016.\nPortfolio Management\nOur portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of apartment communities that is diversified across A,\u201d B,\u201d and C+\u201d price points, averaging B/B+\u201d in quality, and that is diversified across the largest coastal and job growth markets in the U.S. We measure conventional apartment community quality based on average rents of our apartment homes compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis. Under this rating system, we classify as A\u201d quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than 125% of the local market average, as B\u201d quality apartment communities those earning rents between 90% and 125% of the local market average; as C+\u201d quality apartment communities those with rents greater than $1,100 per month, but lower than 90% of local market average; and as C\u201d quality apartment communities those with rents less than $1,100 per month and lower than 90% of local market average. We classify as B/B+\u201d quality a portfolio that on average earns rents between 100% and 125% of the local market average rents where the portfolio is located. Although some companies and analysts within the multifamily real estate industry use apartment community quality ratings of A,\u201d B\u201d and C,\u201d some of which are tied to local market rent averages, the metrics used to classify apartment community quality as well as the timing for which local markets rents are calculated may vary from company to company.\nAccordingly, our rating system for measuring apartment community quality is neither broadly nor consistently used in the multifamily real estate industry.\nAs part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell each year up to 10% of the apartment communities in our portfolio with lower projected free cash flow returns and invest the proceeds from such sales through property upgrades and redevelopment of communities in our current portfolio, occasional development of new communities and selective acquisition of apartment communities with projected free cash flow returns higher than expected from the communities sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, we have significantly increased the quality and expected growth rate of our portfolio as evidenced by increased average revenue per apartment home for the portfolio and higher average rents compared to local market average rents.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of Conventional Net Operating Income in target markets\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,978\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Average Rents as a Percentage of Local Market Average Rents\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage A (4Q 2016 Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home $2,505)\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage B (4Q 2016 Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home $1,771)\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage C+ (4Q 2016 Average Revenue per Effective Apartment Home $1,595)\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage C\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Represents average monthly rental and other property revenues divided by the number of occupied apartment homes multiplied by our economic interest in the apartment community as of the end of the current period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, our conventional portfolio average revenue per effective apartment home was $1,978, an increase of 34.6% as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to rent growth from the improved quality of our portfolio, driven in part by the sale of conventional apartment communities during these periods with average monthly revenues per effective apartment home substantially lower than those of the retained portfolio, and also by our reinvestment of the sales proceeds through redevelopment, development and acquisition of apartment communities with higher rents and better free cash flow return prospects.\nAfter several years of above-trend rent growth, we are seeing rent growth in many markets decelerate due to competitive new supply. As a result of our diversification by both geography and price point, our exposure to competitive new supply is largely limited to approximately one quarter of our portfolio, represented by A\u201d price point communities in submarkets with more than 2% supply growth projected over the next year. This exposure is mitigated in some submarkets where the rate of job growth exceeds the rate of supply growth, and in other submarkets where our A\u201d rents are substantially lower than the rents charged by new supply.\nAs we execute our portfolio strategy, we expect to increase conventional portfolio average revenue per apartment home at a rate greater than market rent growth; increase FCF margins; and increase the percentage of our conventional property net operating income earned in our target markets.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold seven conventional apartment communities with 3,045 apartment homes for gross proceeds of $517.0 million. After payment of transaction costs, working capital adjustments and distributions to noncontrolling interests, our share of the net proceeds totaled $509.1 million. We sold one apartment community from our low-income housing tax credit portfolio for gross proceeds of $27.5 million. After repayment of property debt, payment of transaction costs and distributions to noncontrolling interests, our share of the net proceeds totaled $10.3 million. We invested these proceeds in redevelopment and development discussed below, as well as the acquisition for $320 million of Indigo, a 463-home apartment community in Redwood City, California that was in the final stages of construction at the time of acquisition. As of December 31, 2016, leasing was well ahead of schedule, with 77% of apartment homes occupied at rental rates consistent with underwriting.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nOur leverage strategy seeks to increase financial returns while using leverage with appropriate caution. We target the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA to be below 7.0x and we target the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x. We also focus on the ratios of Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense. Proportionate Debt, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Interest Expense, as used in these ratios, are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined and reconciled under the Non-GAAP Measures - Leverage Ratios heading below. Preferred Equity represents Aimco's preferred stock and the Aimco Operating\nPartnership's preferred OP units. Our leverage ratios for the trailing twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, are presented below:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Trailing Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>6.3x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.4x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>6.7x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.8x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense\n</td> <td>3.2x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1x\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends\n</td> <td>2.9x\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8x\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect future leverage reduction from earnings growth, especially as apartment communities now being redeveloped are completed and the lease-up of Indigo is completed, and from regularly scheduled property debt amortization funded from retained earnings. As of December 31, 2016, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair value of approximately $1.6 billion.\nTwo credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness, using different methodologies and ratios for assessing our credit. In 2015, both of these agencies upgraded our credit rating and outlook to BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Although some of the ratios they use are similar to those we use to measure our leverage, there are differences in our methods of calculation and therefore our leverage ratios disclosed above are not indicative of the ratios that may be calculated by these agencies.\nDuring 2016, we closed fixed-rate, non-recourse, amortizing, property loans totaling $393.5 million with a weighted average term of 9.4 years and weighted average interest rate of 3.2%, which were on average 145 basis points over the corresponding Treasury rates at the time of pricing. During 2016, we also amended our $600.0 million revolving credit facility, extending its maturity to January 2022. For additional information regarding our leverage, please see the discussion under the Liquidity and Capital Resources heading.\nCulture\nOur culture is the key to our success. Our emphasis on a collaborative, respectful, and performance-oriented culture is what enables the continuing transformation of the Aimco business. In 2016, Aimco was recognized by the Denver Post as a Top Work Place for the fourth consecutive year. We were one of only three mid-size companies to be named a Top Work Place in Colorado for the past four consecutive years.\nKey Financial Indicators\nThe key financial indicators that we use in managing our business and in evaluating our operating performance are Economic Income, our measure of total return, and Adjusted Funds From Operations, our measure of current return. In addition to these indicators, we evaluate our operating performance and financial condition using: Pro forma Funds From Operations; FCF capitalization rate; NOI capitalization rate; same store property operating results; proportionate property NOI; average revenue per effective apartment home; financial coverage ratios; and net leverage. Certain of these financial indicators are non-GAAP financial measures, which are defined, further described and, for certain of the measures, reconciled to comparable GAAP-based measures, under the Non-GAAP Measures heading below.\nResults of Operations\nBecause our operating results depend primarily on income from our apartment communities, the supply of and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our apartment communities and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire and dispose of our apartment communities affect our operating results.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\nOverview\n2016 compared to 2015\nNet income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership increased by $181.7 million and $190.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in income was principally due to an increase in gains on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization resulting from redeveloped and developed apartment communities placed into service during 2016 and from recent acquisitions.\n2015 compared to 2014\nNet income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership decreased by $60.5 million and $64.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in income was principally due to a decrease in gains on dispositions of real estate, partially offset by the effect of various other items discussed below.\nThe following paragraphs discuss these and other items affecting the results of operations of Aimco and the Aimco Operating Partnership in more detail.\nProperty Operations\nAs described under the preceding Executive Overview heading, our owned real estate portfolio consists primarily of conventional apartment communities. We also operate a portfolio of affordable apartment communities, the majority of which are held in low-income housing tax credit partnerships. Our conventional and affordable real estate operations that we manage and that are not classified as held for sale at the end of the current period comprise our reportable segments.\nDue to the range of our economic ownership interests in our apartment communities, we use proportionate property NOI to assess the operating performance of our apartment communities and our operating segments. Proportionate property NOI reflects our share of rental and other property revenues reduced by direct property operating expenses, including real estate taxes, for the consolidated apartment communities that we manage. Accordingly, the results of operations of our conventional and affordable segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four conventional apartment communities with 142 apartment homes and eight affordable apartment communities with 727 apartment homes that we do not manage and one affordable community with 52 apartment homes that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2016.\nWe do not include property management revenues, offsite costs associated with property management or casualty-related amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below. Refer to Note 12 in the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our reportable segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues and property operating expenses.\nConventional Real Estate Operations\nOur Conventional segment consists of apartment communities we classify as Conventional Same Store and Conventional Non-Same Store. Conventional Same Store apartment communities are those that have reached stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of a two year comparable period and maintained it throughout the current and comparable prior year, and that are not expected to be sold within 12 months. Conventional Non-Same Store consists of conventional redevelopment and development apartment communities, which are those currently under construction that are not occupancy stabilized and those that have been completed in recent years that had not achieved and maintained stabilized occupancy for both the current and comparable prior year, and conventional acquisition apartment communities, which are those we have acquired since the beginning of a two year comparable period. Conventional Non-Same Store also includes apartment communities subject to agreements that limit the amount by which we may increase rents; apartment communities that had not reached or maintained a stabilized level of occupancy as of the beginning of a two year comparable period, often due to a casualty event; and apartment communities expected to be sold within 12 months but do not yet meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\nAs of December 31, 2016, as defined by our segment performance metrics, our conventional portfolio consisted of the following:\n \u2022 101 Conventional Same Store apartment communities with 30,893 apartment homes; and \n \u2022 29 Conventional Non-Same Store apartment communities with 6,887 apartment homes. \nFrom December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, on a net basis, our Conventional Same Store portfolio decreased by six apartment communities and 2,256 apartment homes. This change consisted of:\n \u2022 five conventional redevelopment apartment communities with 1,544 apartment homes that were reclassified into Conventional Non-Same Store; \n \u2022 one apartment community with 246 apartment homes reclassified into Conventional Non-Same Store as a result of a casualty event; and \n \u2022 five apartment communities with 1,727 apartment homes sold during the period.  These decreases were offset by the addition of five apartment communities that were reclassified from Conventional Non-Same Store, including three acquisition communities with 818 apartment homes as we have now owned them for the entirety of both periods presented, and two redeveloped apartment communities with 443 apartment homes that were reclassified upon maintaining stabilized occupancy for the entirety of both periods presented.\nOur proportionate conventional portfolio results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental and other property revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>606,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>168,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,674\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>804,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>752,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>192,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>65,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>257,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Property net operating income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Same Store\n</td> <td>443,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>417,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Conventional Non-Same Store\n</td> <td>103,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>546,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>505,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, our conventional segment's proportionate property NOI increased $40.8 million, or 8.1%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, Conventional Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $25.9 million, or 6.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $28.5 million, or 4.7%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues (approximately $82 per effective home), comprised primarily of increases in rental rates of 4.0%. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2016, were 2.4% higher than expiring lease rates, and renewal rates were 5.7% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in Conventional Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $2.6 million, or 1.4%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes, personnel costs and repairs and maintenance, partially offset by lower utilities expenses and insurance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $1.6 million, or 1.9%.\nOur Conventional Non-Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015. This increase is attributable to the following:\n \u2022 $7.8 million increase due to the NOI stabilization of three redeveloped communities (Lincoln Place, Ocean House on Prospect and Preserve at Marin); \n \u2022 $2.6 million due to completing lease-up of Vivo and nearing completion of the lease-up of Indigo and One Canal; \n \u2022 $3.4 million due to apartment communities we acquired during 2015; and \n \u2022 $1.1 million due to other net increases in proportionate property NOI including the continued lease-up of redeveloped homes at Park Towne Place and The Sterling, offset by decreases due to apartment homes taken out of service for our current redevelopments. \nAs of December 31, 2015, our conventional portfolio consisted of the following:\n \u2022 102 Conventional Same Store apartment communities with 31,422 apartment homes; and \n \u2022 27 Conventional Non-Same Store apartment communities with 5,855 apartment homes.

This increase was primarily attributable to a $27.5 million, or 4.6%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues (approximately $78 per effective home), comprised of increases in rental rates, utility reimbursements and other fees, including parking. Rental rates on new leases transacted during the year ended December 31, 2015, were 4.4% higher than expiring lease rates, and renewal rates were 5.5% higher than expiring lease rates. The increase in Conventional Same Store rental and other property revenues was partially offset by a $3.8 million, or 2.0%, increase in property operating expenses, primarily due to increases in real estate taxes and repairs and maintenance. During the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes and insurance, increased by $2.0 million, or 2.3%.\nOur Conventional Non-Same Store proportionate property NOI increased by $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014. Proportionate property NOI increased $13.1 million due to apartment communities that we acquired in 2015 and 2014. Proportionate property NOI increased $13.3 million due to higher revenues per apartment home and higher average daily occupancy associated with apartment homes placed into service following completion of construction activities at Lincoln Place, Preserve at Marin and Pacific Bay Vistas, partially offset by a reduction in revenue associated with apartment homes taken out of service at our Park Towne Place and The Sterling redevelopments during 2015.\nAffordable Real Estate Operations\nOur affordable portfolio consists primarily of apartment communities that we manage that are owned through low-income housing tax credit partnerships. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our affordable portfolio consisted of 46 apartment communities with 7,610 apartment homes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to 2015, our affordable portfolio's proportionate property NOI increased $6.1 million, or 10.9%. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in rental income driven by higher rental rates, including market rate increases on four apartment communities that were approved in 2016 by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, partially offset by higher personnel and repairs and maintenance costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to 2014, the proportionate property NOI of our affordable apartment communities increased $1.6 million, or 2.9%. The increase was attributable to an increase in rental income driven primarily by higher rental rates of $23 per month on apartment homes.\nNon-Segment Real Estate Operations\nReal estate operations NOI amounts not attributed to our conventional or affordable segments include offsite costs associated with property management and casualty losses, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our conventional or affordable segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, casualty losses totaled $5.8 million, $8.3 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2016, included claims related to fire damage, water damage resulting from a storm affecting several communities, and water damage resulting from damaged pipes at several other communities. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2015, included losses resulting from property damage and snow removal costs associated with the severe snow storms in the Northeast. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2014, included losses from the severe weather associated with the 2014 Polar Vortex,\u201d which affected many of our apartment communities in the Northeast and Midwest, as well as damage to one of our apartment communities resulting from a severe hail storm.\nTax Credit and Asset Management Revenues\nWe sponsor certain consolidated partnerships that acquire, develop and operate qualifying affordable housing apartment communities and are structured to provide for the pass-through of tax credits and deductions to their partners. We recognize income associated with the delivery of tax credits and deductions generated by these partnerships to their partners.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, tax credit and asset management revenues decreased $3.0 million. This decrease was primarily attributable to $6.6 million lower amortization of deferred tax credit income primarily due to delivery of substantially all of the"}
