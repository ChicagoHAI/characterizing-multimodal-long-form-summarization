Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn addition, this section discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Annual Report and can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics for immuno-oncology, genetic disorders and other indications based on our proprietary Spherical Nucleic Acid, or SNA, technology. SNAs are nanoscale constructs consisting of densely packed synthetic nucleic acid sequences that are radially arranged in three dimensions. We believe the design of our SNAs gives rise to distinct chemical and biological properties that may provide advantages over other nucleic acid therapeutics and enable therapeutic activity outside of the liver. We are conducting IND-enabling studies for XCUR-FXN, an SNA-based therapeutic candidate, for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) and expect to initiate a first-in-patient Phase 1b clinical trial in 2022. We are also working to advance our SNA-based therapeutic candidate cavrotolimod (AST-008) in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in cancer patients.\nWe believe that one of the key strengths of our proprietary SNAs is that they have the potential for increased cellular uptake compared to conventional linear oligonucleotides and as a result the potential to achieve higher efficacy at the same doses of oligonucleotide administered. We have shown in clinical and preclinical studies that SNAs may have therapeutic potential in neurology, immuno-oncology and dermatology. In addition, we have shown in preclinical studies that SNAs may have therapeutic potential in ophthalmology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. As a consequence, we have expanded our pipeline into neurology, and are conducting early stage research activities in ophthalmology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology.\nOperating, financing, and cash flow considerations\nSince our inception in 2011, we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of SNAs and the protection and enhancement of our intellectual property. We have no products approved for sale and have primarily funded our operations through sales of our securities and collaborations. Through December 31, 2020, we have raised gross proceeds of $190.1 million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock. We have also received $36.0 million in upfront payments under our current collaborations, including an upfront payment of $25.0 million we received in November 2019 in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement and an upfront payment of $1.0 million we received in February 2019 in connection with the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement. On September 25, 2020, we also borrowed $17.5 million under the terms of a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust (as described further below). As of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated an accumulated deficit of 124.8 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022continue to advance cavrotolimod (AST-008) through clinical development for immuno-oncology applications;\n\u2022continue research and development of XCUR-FXN and other neurological therapeutic candidates;\n\u2022advance our SNA platform in dermatological indications with suitable collaboration partners;\n\u2022initiate research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional therapeutic candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u2022advance other therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical development;\n\u2022increase our research and development activities to enhance our technology;\n\u2022continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022acquire or in-license other approved drugs, drug candidates or technologies;\n\u2022hire additional operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial drug sales nor do we expect to generate substantial revenue from product sales unless or until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one or more of our therapeutic candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from drug sales for the next several years, if ever. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Other sources of revenue could include a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties in connection with our current and any future collaborations and licenses. Until such time, if ever, that we generate revenue from whatever source, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings and research collaboration and license agreements. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our therapeutic candidates.\nCOVID-19 Business Update\nWith the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, we continue to monitor closely the developments and continue to take active measures to protect the health of our employees and their families, our communities, as well as our clinical trial investigators, patients, and caregivers. As of March 5, 2021, Illinois is under Phase 4\u201d of the Restore Illinois Plan, which is intended to permit the expansion of business and community operations based on their compliance with the safety guidelines described in the regulations, with new mitigation measures that may require additional restrictions or adaptations being applied on a regional basis within the State of Illinois based on risk levels depending on the health progress of each region to prevent the ongoing spread of COVID-19.\nBusiness and R&D operations\nUnder social distancing guidelines for COVID-19, we were typically operating with less than 50% of our R&D staff on-site at any one time through June 30, 2020. As of July 1, 2020, we took occupancy of approximately 30,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in our new headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. Since then, we have operated under COVID-19 social distancing guidelines and have generally operated with 100% of our R&D staff on-site. Our office and general and administrative team continues to work predominantly from home. Our preclinical development program in FA is ongoing and we began IND-enabling studies for XCUR-FXN in late 2020. We also continue to progress our collaborations with AbbVie and Dermelix. If the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact or effects continues to persist for an extended period of time, we could experience additional delays in our enrollment of patients for the Phase 2 trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008) and significant disruptions to our preclinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur principal accounting systems are cloud-based and have been fully operational during the stay at home order. We believe that all of our fundamental internal control disciplines are being maintained despite work being conducted from our employees' homes.\nSupply chain\nWe are working closely with our third-party manufacturers and other partners to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have observed minor delays in receipt of key chemicals, reagents and materials as certain manufacturers have had supply disruptions, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time and impacts essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience future disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and our clinical supply, which would adversely impact our preclinical and clinical development activities.\nClinical operations\nWe have one active clinical program, cavrotolimod (AST-008). We have completed enrollment for the Phase 1b stage of the clinical trial and have begun the Phase 2 dose expansion phase in patients with advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. During the third quarter of 2020 and through December 31, 2020, we observed delays in our enrollment plans and clinical trial site start-ups for the Phase 2 dose expansion phase of the trial. We believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact contributed to such delays. As a result, we have taken additional measures to increase the enrollment of patients, including frequent interaction with our clinical trial sites currently open as well as increasing the number of clinical trial sites that potentially are activated for this trial so that we may continue to enroll patients as initially planned. However, these delays have caused us to lengthen our clinical development timeline for cavrotolimod (AST-008), and we now expect to report overall response rate, or ORR, results in the first half of 2022 rather than by year end 2021 as previously guided in September 2020.\nWe remain committed to maintaining our development plans for cavrotolimod (AST-008) and continue to monitor and manage the rapidly evolving situation. We have taken and continue to take measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote patient monitoring where possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve study integrity. Should the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact or effects continue, our ability to maintain patient enrollment and our clinical development timeline could continue to be negatively impacted. We could also see an impact on our ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time, we continue to be impacted and could experience additional delays in patient enrollment for our Phase 2 clinical trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008). Any significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines would further delay our anticipated timeline for results and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that existing working capital at December 31, 2020, including amounts borrowed and available under the MidCap Credit Facility (see below), is sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of this report. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us including due to the effects of COVID-19, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. We have historically principally raised capital through the sale of our securities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. We believe raising capital in the current market could be very difficult for early stage biotech companies like us. If the disruption continues to persist and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.\nRecent Developments\nTherapeutic Development Program Updates\nCavrotolimod (AST-008)\nAs of February 23, 2021, we had 16 clinical trial sites open for enrollment and 7 additional sites pending activation. We expect to open up to 30 sites for the Phase 2 stage of the clinical trial. We anticipate all sites will be activated by the end of 2021. As of February 23, 2021, we had dosed 16 patients with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, including the primary and exploratory cohorts. Including the six patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial, a total of 22 patients have been dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008). As of February 23, 2021, 1 of the 22 patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) has experienced a treatment-related SAE as determined by the clinical trial investigator. This patient, enrolled in the Phase 2 stage of the clinical trial, reported a treatment-related SAE of hypotension, flu-like symptoms which subsequently resolved. None of the 14 patients dosed in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial with doses of cavrotolimod (AST-008) less than 32 mg experienced a treatment related SAE. Thus, as of February 23, 2021, in total, 1 of 36 patients treated with cavrotolimod (AST-008) have experienced a treatment related SAE.\nChanges in Board of Directors\nEffective March 5, 2021, Elizabeth Garofalo, M.D. and Andrew Sassine were appointed to our Board, each to serve as directors and as members of the Audit Committee. Effective January 2, 2021, James Sulat was appointed to our Board, to serve as a director and chairperson of the Audit Committee.\nOn March 8, 2021, David R. Walt, Ph.D. notified the Board of his intention not to stand for re-election as a director when his term expires at our upcoming 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nAt-the-Market Offering Agreement\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with BMO Capital Markets Corp., or BMO, with respect to an at the market offering\u201d program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through BMO as our distribution agent. We are not obligated to sell any shares under the equity distribution agreement. As of December 31, 2020, no shares had been sold under the equity distribution agreement.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe audited financial statements of Exicure, Inc. for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, contained herein, include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below.\nSegment Reporting\nWe view our operations and manage our business as one segment, which is the discovery, research and development of treatments based on our SNA technology.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps:\n1.Identify the contract with the customer. A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party's rights and obligations regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer's intent and ability to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer's historical payment experience, or in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n3.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable\nconsideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment.\n4.Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. However, if a series of distinct services that are substantially the same qualifies as a single performance obligation in a contract with variable consideration, we must determine if the variable consideration is attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices.\n5.Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance, (ii) the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. Examples of control are using the asset to produce goods or services, enhance the value of other assets, or settle liabilities, and holding or selling the asset.\nLicenses of intellectual property: If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the licenses. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate the probability of reaching the milestones and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in the future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore revenue recognized is constrained as management is unable to assert that a reversal of revenue would not be possible. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. To date, we have not recognized any milestone payment revenue from any of its collaboration agreements.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its collaboration agreements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have primarily earned revenue under the collaboration agreements with AbbVie and Dermelix (see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nEquity-based compensation\nWe measure the cost of common stock option awards at fair value and record the cost of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We measure fair value for all common stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For all common stock option awards, the fair value measurement date is the date of grant and the requisite service period is the period over which the option recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the common stock option awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including: (1) the estimated grant date fair value of our common stock; (2) the option exercise price; (3) the expected term of the option in years; (4) the annualized volatility of the stock; (5) the risk-free interest rate; and (6) the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock.\nThe expected term is based upon the simplified method\u201d as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14.D.2. Currently, we do not have sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate of an expected term of its common stock options. We will continue to use the simplified method\u201d until there is sufficient experience to provide a more reasonable estimate in conformance with ASC 718-10-30-25 through 30-26. The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate appropriate for the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on calculated enterprise value volatilities for publicly traded companies in the same industry and general stage of development. The estimated forfeiture rates were based on historical experience for similar classes of employees. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nRefer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have earned all of our revenue through December 31, 2020 through our research collaboration license and option agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, our research collaboration, license, and option agreement with Purdue Pharma L.P., or the Purdue Collaboration Agreement, or through our research collaboration license and option agreement with Dermelix. We have also earned revenue as a primary contractor or as a subcontractor on government grants. We do not intend for government grants to be a principal commercial or strategic focus, but will evaluate opportunities when consistent with our strategic priorities. We have not generated any commercial product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future.\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from partnership activities including a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, product sales and royalties, and reimbursement of certain research and development expenses, in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement, or any future collaborations and licenses. We expect that any such revenue we generate will fluctuate in future periods as a result of the timing of achievement, if at all, of preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones, the timing and amount of any payments to us relating to such milestones and the extent to which any of our therapeutic candidates are approved and successfully commercialized by us or potential development partners. If we, or any potential development partner fails to develop therapeutic candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially and adversely affected.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense consists of costs associated with our research activities, including basic research on our SNA platform, discovery and development of novel SNAs as prospective therapeutic candidates, preclinical and clinical development activities for SNAs we have nominated for clinical development as well as maintaining and protecting our intellectual property. Our research and development expenses include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and equity-based compensation expense;\n\u2022early research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants;\n\u2022preclinical and clinical development expenses with third parties such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants;\n\u2022costs of maintaining and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including legal advisory fees, license fees, sublicense fees, patent maintenance and other similar fees;\n\u2022laboratory materials and supplies;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as they are incurred. A significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our therapeutic candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or future development partners may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates. The probability of success for each therapeutic candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.\nAll of our research and development programs are at an early stage and successful development of future therapeutic candidates from these programs is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each future therapeutic candidate and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which therapeutic candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each therapeutic candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the early scientific, preclinical and clinical success of each therapeutic candidate, our ability to maintain or enter into development partnerships with respect to a given therapeutic candidate, as well as ongoing assessments of the commercial potential of therapeutic candidates.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to fund our research and development activities. We have entered into, and may in the future seek, collaborations, licensing or other commercial relationships with other companies in order to advance our various therapeutic candidates. Such collaborations may provide near-term cash payments from the collaborators to us in exchange for license rights or for expense reimbursement, but may also materially reduce the long-term economic benefits that could otherwise be realized from a therapeutic candidate subject to a collaboration in the event that such therapeutic candidate becomes commercially viable. Additional private or public financings may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nGeneral and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related benefits, including equity-based compensation, related to our executive, finance, legal, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include travel expenses, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services and allocated facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued research activities and development of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will incur significantly increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance and director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nDividend income\nDividend income consists of income earned on our money market funds that are recorded as cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest income\nInterest income consists of income earned on our available for sale securities that are recorded as short-term investments on our consolidated balance sheets, as well as income earned on our cash balances.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense includes amounts pursuant to the loan and security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, or Hercules, for which we repaid all remaining outstanding obligations under the Hercules loan agreement at its maturity on March 1, 2020. Interest expense also includes amounts pursuant to the MidCap Credit Agreement. See -MidCap Credit Agreement\u201d below for additional information.\nOther income (loss), net\nOther income (loss), net consists of fair value adjustments of our common stock warrant liabilities and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the

during the year ended December 31, 2020, which is primarily related to activities performed under the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement. In November 2019, we received an upfront payment of $25.0 million in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement for which revenue has been deferred and will be recognized as revenue in future periods as we satisfy our obligations under the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement. At December 31, 2020, deferred revenue under the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement was $8.3 million and is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next twelve months as we satisfy our obligations under the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement. Refer to Note 3 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding revenue recognition for the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement.\nThe collaboration revenue of $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the reimbursable research and development activities performed under the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement, for which related costs are presented on a gross basis in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.\nWe do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future. However, future revenue may include amounts attributable to partnership activities including, a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, product sales and royalties, and reimbursement of certain research and development expenses, in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement or the Dermelix License Agreement or any future collaboration and licenses.\nResearch and development expense\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses incurred during the periods indicated:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Platform and discovery-related expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Clinical development programs expense </td> <td>8,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee-related expense </td> <td>7,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,677 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facilities, depreciation, and other expenses </td> <td>2,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full time employees </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense was $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting an increase of $12.8 million, or 66%, from research and development expense of $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Since December 31, 2019, we have increased our headcount in research and development from 29 to 54 at December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $12.8 million reflects this increased staffing level and the related increase in research and development activities, in addition to the growth in clinical trial activities. More specifically, the increase in research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $12.8 million was primarily due to higher platform and discovery-related expense of $4.9 million, a net increase in costs related to our clinical development programs of $3.2 million, higher employee-related expenses of $3.0 million, and higher facilities, depreciation, and other expenses in the amount of $1.6 million.\nThe increase in platform and discovery-related expense of $4.9 million is mostly due to higher costs for materials, reagents, lab supplies, and contract research organizations, all in connection with increased research and development activities related to the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, our FA program, XCUR-FXN, and our discovery efforts for other therapeutic candidates for neurology and ophthalmology, partially offset by the absence of a license fee of $3.8 million paid in 2019 to Northwestern University in connection with the receipt of the $25.0 million upfront payment from AbbVie.\nThe net increase in clinical development programs expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.2 million was primarily due to manufacturing costs in connection with the initiation of the upcoming Phase 2 phase of our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for cavrotolimod (AST-008) and other higher clinical trial expenses, as well as manufacturing costs in connection with the preparation of IND-enabling and Phase 1 clinical trial activities for XCUR-FXN, partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses for XCUR17.\nThe increase in employee-related expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $3.0 million was due to higher compensation and related costs in connection with the net increase in headcount during the period presented as well as certain salary increases in 2020 for existing employees and higher recruiting costs. The increase in facilities, depreciation, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $1.6 million was mostly due to the acceleration of amortization expense for our right-of-use asset related to our Skokie lease which we no longer\nuse effective July 1, 2020 due to our move to our Chicago headquarters, higher lease costs related to our Chicago Lease that commenced on July 1, 2020 as well as higher depreciation expense in connection with the acquisition of additional scientific equipment that were placed in service since the prior-year period.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase during 2021 as we broaden our pipeline of SNA-based therapeutic candidates, continue spending on our clinical development programs, and further develop our SNA technology platform.\nGeneral and administrative expense\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,955 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Full time employees </td> <td>9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expense was $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, representing an increase of $1.4 million, or 16%, from $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 is mostly due to higher legal and accounting costs associated with operating as a public company, higher franchise tax costs, higher D&O insurance premium costs, partially offset by lower travel and related costs.\nDividend income\nThe decrease in dividend income of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of lower average balances invested in money market funds during 2020 as compared to 2019.\nInterest income\nThe increase in interest income of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was the result of higher average balances invested in available for sale securities during 2020 as compared to 2019.\nInterest expense\nThe decrease in interest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was mostly due to lower interest expense resulting from the repayment of outstanding obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement upon maturity on March 2, 2020, partially offset by incremental interest expense resulting from $17.5 million borrowed on September 25, 2020 under the MidCap Credit Agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that existing working capital at December 31, 2020, including amounts borrowed and available under the MidCap Credit Facility (see below), is sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of this report. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us including due to the effects of COVID-19, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. We have historically principally raised capital through the sale of our securities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. We believe raising capital in the current market could be very difficult for early stage biotech companies like us. If the disruption continues to persist and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.\nOn September 25, 2020, we borrowed the first advance of $17.5 million (Tranche 1) under the terms of the MidCap Credit Agreement (as discussed further below). The second advance of $7.5 million (Tranche 2) will be available to us from April 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions described in the MidCap Credit Agreement. See -MidCap Credit Agreement\u201d below for additional information.\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with BMO under which we may offer and sell in at the market offerings\u201d (as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended) from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through BMO acting as our distribution agent, or the ATM Offering. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not sell any shares under the equity distribution agreement.\nIn March 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 24, 2019. The shelf registration statement allows us to sell from time-to-time up to $125.0 million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or units comprised of any combination of these securities, for our own account in one or more offerings; the remaining amount available under this shelf registration is approximately $31.3 million.\nOn January 6, 2020, we sold 1,081,184 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.75 per share pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares at the public offering price in connection with the December 2019 Offering. We received gross proceeds of $3.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of $0.2 million in January 2020 in connection with the December 2019 offering.\nSimilar to other development stage biotechnology companies, we have not generated any revenue since inception. We have incurred losses and experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated an accumulated deficit of 124.8 million.\nSee -Funding Requirements\u201d below for additional information on our future capital needs.\nCash Flows\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(39,270) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,317 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>10,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63,432) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>15,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,998) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities was $(39.3) million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in cash used in operating activities of $40.6 million was primarily due to higher cash used for working capital and the absence of a $25.0 million upfront payment received in 2019 in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement.\nInvesting activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $10.1 million and $(63.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in cash provided by investing activities of $73.6 million was primarily due to lower purchases, net of maturities, of available-for-sale securities.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to the net proceeds we received of $17.3 million during the period in connection with the MidCap Credit Agreement, as well as the net proceeds received from the sale of shares of our common stock in the amount of $2.8 million pursuant to the partial exercise of the option to purchase additional shares by the underwriters from our December 2019 financing, partially offset by the repayment of the Hercules loan in the amount of $5.0 million upon the loan's maturity.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $84.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to the sale of common stock in our December 2019 and August 2019 offerings. In December 2019 , we completed the offering and sale of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $2.75 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $25.3 million. In August 2019 , we completed the offering and sale of 31,625,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $2.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $58.9 million.\nMidCap Credit and Security Agreement\nOn September 25, 2020, the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Exicure Operating Company, entered into the MidCap Credit Agreement, with MidCap , as agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time.\nThe MidCap Credit Agreement provides for a secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $25.0 million, or the MidCap Credit Facility. We borrowed the first advance of $17.5 million, or Tranche 1, on September 25, 2020, or the Closing Date. Under the terms of the MidCap Credit Agreement, the second advance of $7.5 million, or Tranche 2, will be available to us from April 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021, subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions described in the MidCap Credit Agreement. The proceeds from the MidCap Credit Facility are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nTranche 1, and if borrowed Tranche 2, each bear interest at a floating rate equal to 6.25% per annum, plus the greater of (i) 1.50% or (ii) one-month LIBOR. Interest on each loan advance is due and payable monthly in arrears. Principal on each loan advance is payable in 36 equal monthly installments beginning October 1, 2022 until paid in full on October 1, 2025, or Maturity Date. Prepayments of the loans under the MidCap Credit Agreement, in whole or in part, will be subject to early termination fees in an amount equal to 3.0% of principal prepaid if prepayment occurs on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date and 1.0% of principal prepaid if prepayment occurs after the first anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the maturity date. In connection with execution of the MidCap Credit Agreement, we paid MidCap a $125,000 origination fee.\nAt the Maturity Date or on any earlier date on which all amounts advanced to us become due and payable in full, or are otherwise paid in full, we are required to pay an exit fee equal to 3.75% of the principal amount of all loans advanced to us under the MidCap Credit Agreement.\nOur obligations under the MidCap Credit Agreement are secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding intellectual property (which is subject to a negative pledge). Additionally, our future subsidiaries, if any, may be required to become co-borrowers or guarantors under the MidCap Credit Agreement.\nThe MidCap Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants limiting our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries, if any, to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions.\nThe MidCap Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default relating to, among other things, payment defaults, breaches of covenants, a material adverse change, delisting of our common stock, bankruptcy and insolvency, cross defaults with certain material indebtedness and certain material contracts, judgments, and inaccuracies of representations and warranties. Upon an event of default, the agent and the lenders may declare all or a portion of our outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable and exercise other rights and remedies\nprovided for under the agreement. During the existence of an event of default, interest on the obligations could be increased by 2.0%.\nHercules Loan and Security Agreement\nOn March 2, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital, or Hercules, and subsequent amendments thereto, or Hercules Loan Agreement, we repaid all remaining outstanding obligations under the Hercules Loan Agreement, to include the outstanding principal balance of $5.0 million and a deferred end of term fee of $0.1 million. As a result, Hercules no longer has a security interest in any of our assets.\nFunding Requirements\nWe expect that our primary uses of capital will continue to be third-party clinical and research and development services, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and related supplies, legal and other regulatory expenses and general overhead costs. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research, development and commercialization of therapeutic candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our working capital requirements. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the terms and timing of any other collaboration, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022the initiation, progress, timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our potential therapeutic candidates;\n\u2022the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on our operations or the business or operations of our CROs or other third parties with whom we conduct business;\n\u2022the number and characteristics of therapeutic candidates that we pursue;\n\u2022the progress, costs and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the cost and timing of hiring new employees to support our continued growth;\n\u2022unknown legal, administrative, regulatory, accounting, and information technology costs as well as additional costs associated with operating as a public company;\n\u2022the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims;\n\u2022the costs of filing and prosecuting intellectual property rights and enforcing and defending any intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022the costs and timing of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our therapeutic candidates;\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or in-license other therapeutic candidates and technologies; and\n\u2022the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, therapeutic candidates or technologies.\nBased on our current operating plans, we believe that our existing working capital at December 31, 2020, including amounts borrowed and available under the MidCap Credit Facility is sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of this report. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our capital resources sooner than we expect.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption continues to persist and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through future equity financings, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing common stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development efforts or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nChicago Lease\nIn February 2020, we entered into a new lease signed in February 2020 to secure approximately 30,000 square feet of office and laboratory space at 2430 N. Halsted St., Chicago, Illinois, or the Chicago Lease. The Chicago Lease commenced on July 1, 2020, which is when the premises leased thereunder were ready for occupancy, and expires 10 years from July 1, 2020 with an option to renew for two additional successive periods of five years each.\nThe initial annual base rent during the original term of the Chicago Lease is approximately $1.1 million for the first 12-month period of the original term, payable in monthly installments beginning on the lease commencement. Base rent thereafter is subject to annual increases of 3%, for an aggregate amount of $12.8 million over the initial term. We must also pay our proportionate share of certain operating expenses and taxes for each calendar year during the term. During the first 12 months, the base rent and our proportionate share of operating expenses and taxes are subject to certain abatements.\nIn connection with the Chicago Lease, we will maintain a letter of credit for the benefit of the landlord in an initial amount of $1.2 million, which amount is subject to reduction over time.\nMidCap Credit and Security Agreement\nOn September 25, 2020, we borrowed the first advance of $17.5 million (Tranche 1) under the terms of the MidCap Credit Agreement (as discussed further above). Tranche 1 bears interest at a floating rate equal to 6.25% per annum, plus the greater of (i) 1.50% or (ii) one-month LIBOR. Interest on each loan advance is due and payable monthly in arrears. Principal on the Tranche 1 loan advance is payable in 36 equal monthly installments beginning October 1, 2022 until paid in full on October 1, 2025. Upon termination of the MidCap Credit Agreement, we are required to pay an exit fee equal to 3.75% of the principal amount of all loans advanced to us under the MidCap Credit Agreement.\nOther\nWe enter into agreements in the normal course of business with contract research organizations and vendors for clinical trials, preclinical studies, and other services and products for operating purposes which are cancelable at any\ntime by us, generally upon 30 days prior written notice. We also have obligations to make future payments to Northwestern University that become due and payable on the achievement of certain commercial milestones. These payments are not included in this table of contractual obligations.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nJOBS Act\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.

You should review the disclosure under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn addition, this section discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Annual Report and can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics for immuno-oncology, genetic disorders and other indications based on our proprietary Spherical Nucleic Acid, or SNA, technology. SNAs are nanoscale constructs consisting of densely packed synthetic nucleic acid sequences that are radially arranged in three dimensions. We believe the design of our SNAs gives rise to distinct chemical and biological properties that may provide advantages over other nucleic acid therapeutics and enable therapeutic activity outside of the liver. We are conducting IND-enabling studies for XCUR-FXN, an SNA-based therapeutic candidate, for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) and expect to initiate a first-in-patient Phase 1b clinical trial in 2022. We are also working to advance our SNA-based therapeutic candidate cavrotolimod (AST-008) in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in cancer patients.\nWe believe that one of the key strengths of our proprietary SNAs is that they have the potential for increased cellular uptake compared to conventional linear oligonucleotides and as a result the potential to achieve higher efficacy at the same doses of oligonucleotide administered. We have shown in clinical and preclinical studies that SNAs may have therapeutic potential in neurology, immuno-oncology and dermatology. In addition, we have shown in preclinical studies that SNAs may have therapeutic potential in ophthalmology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. As a consequence, we have expanded our pipeline into neurology, and are conducting early stage research activities in ophthalmology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology.\nOperating, financing, and cash flow considerations\nSince our inception in 2011, we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of SNAs and the protection and enhancement of our intellectual property. We have no products approved for sale and have primarily funded our operations through sales of our securities and collaborations. Through December 31, 2020, we have raised gross proceeds of $190.1 million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock. We have also received $36.0 million in upfront payments under our current collaborations, including an upfront payment of $25.0 million we received in November 2019 in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement and an upfront payment of $1.0 million we received in February 2019 in connection with the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement. On September 25, 2020, we also borrowed $17.5 million under the terms of a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust (as described further below). As of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated an accumulated deficit of 124.8 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022continue to advance cavrotolimod (AST-008) through clinical development for immuno-oncology applications;\n\u2022continue research and development of XCUR-FXN and other neurological therapeutic candidates;\n\u2022advance our SNA platform in dermatological indications with suitable collaboration partners;\n\u2022initiate research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional therapeutic candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u2022advance other therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical development;\n\u2022increase our research and development activities to enhance our technology;\n\u2022continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022acquire or in-license other approved drugs, drug candidates or technologies;\n\u2022hire additional operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial drug sales nor do we expect to generate substantial revenue from product sales unless or until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one or more of our therapeutic candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from drug sales for the next several years, if ever. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Other sources of revenue could include a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties in connection with our current and any future collaborations and licenses. Until such time, if ever, that we generate revenue from whatever source, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings and research collaboration and license agreements. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our therapeutic candidates.\nCOVID-19 Business Update\nWith the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, we continue to monitor closely the developments and continue to take active measures to protect the health of our employees and their families, our communities, as well as our clinical trial investigators, patients, and caregivers. As of March 5, 2021, Illinois is under Phase 4\u201d of the Restore Illinois Plan, which is intended to permit the expansion of business and community operations based on their compliance with the safety guidelines described in the regulations, with new mitigation measures that may require additional restrictions or adaptations being applied on a regional basis within the State of Illinois based on risk levels depending on the health progress of each region to prevent the ongoing spread of COVID-19.\nBusiness and R&D operations\nUnder social distancing guidelines for COVID-19, we were typically operating with less than 50% of our R&D staff on-site at any one time through June 30, 2020. As of July 1, 2020, we took occupancy of approximately 30,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in our new headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. Since then, we have operated under COVID-19 social distancing guidelines and have generally operated with 100% of our R&D staff on-site. Our office and general and administrative team continues to work predominantly from home. Our preclinical development program in FA is ongoing and we began IND-enabling studies for XCUR-FXN in late 2020. We also continue to progress our collaborations with AbbVie and Dermelix. If the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact or effects continues to persist for an extended period of time, we could experience additional delays in our enrollment of patients for the Phase 2 trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008) and significant disruptions to our preclinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur principal accounting systems are cloud-based and have been fully operational during the stay at home order. We believe that all of our fundamental internal control disciplines are being maintained despite work being conducted from our employees' homes.\nSupply chain\nWe are working closely with our third-party manufacturers and other partners to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have observed minor delays in receipt of key chemicals, reagents and materials as certain manufacturers have had supply disruptions, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time and impacts essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience future disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and our clinical supply, which would adversely impact our preclinical and clinical development activities.\nClinical operations\nWe have one active clinical program, cavrotolimod (AST-008). We have completed enrollment for the Phase 1b stage of the clinical trial and have begun the Phase 2 dose expansion phase in patients with advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. During the third quarter of 2020 and through December 31, 2020, we observed delays in our enrollment plans and clinical trial site start-ups for the Phase 2 dose expansion phase of the trial. We believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact contributed to such delays. As a result, we have taken additional measures to increase the enrollment of patients, including frequent interaction with our clinical trial sites currently open as well as increasing the number of clinical trial sites that potentially are activated for this trial so that we may continue to enroll patients as initially planned. However, these delays have caused us to lengthen our clinical development timeline for cavrotolimod (AST-008), and we now expect to report overall response rate, or ORR, results in the first half of 2022 rather than by year end 2021 as previously guided in September 2020.\nWe remain committed to maintaining our development plans for cavrotolimod (AST-008) and continue to monitor and manage the rapidly evolving situation. We have taken and continue to take measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote patient monitoring where possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve study integrity. Should the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact or effects continue, our ability to maintain patient enrollment and our clinical development timeline could continue to be negatively impacted. We could also see an impact on our ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time, we continue to be impacted and could experience additional delays in patient enrollment for our Phase 2 clinical trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008). Any significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines would further delay our anticipated timeline for results and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that existing working capital at December 31, 2020, including amounts borrowed and available under the MidCap Credit Facility (see below), is sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of this report. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us including due to the effects of COVID-19, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. We have historically principally raised capital through the sale of our securities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. We believe raising capital in the current market could be very difficult for early stage biotech companies like us. If the disruption continues to persist and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.\nRecent Developments\nTherapeutic Development Program Updates\nCavrotolimod (AST-008)\nAs of February 23, 2021, we had 16 clinical trial sites open for enrollment and 7 additional sites pending activation. We expect to open up to 30 sites for the Phase 2 stage of the clinical trial. We anticipate all sites will be activated by the end of 2021. As of February 23, 2021, we had dosed 16 patients with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, including the primary and exploratory cohorts. Including the six patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial, a total of 22 patients have been dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008). As of February 23, 2021, 1 of the 22 patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) has experienced a treatment-related SAE as determined by the clinical trial investigator. This patient, enrolled in the Phase 2 stage of the clinical trial, reported a treatment-related SAE of hypotension, flu-like symptoms which subsequently resolved. None of the 14 patients dosed in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial with doses of cavrotolimod (AST-008) less than 32 mg experienced a treatment related SAE. Thus, as of February 23, 2021, in total, 1 of 36 patients treated with cavrotolimod (AST-008) have experienced a treatment related SAE.\nChanges in Board of Directors\nEffective March 5, 2021, Elizabeth Garofalo, M.D. and Andrew Sassine were appointed to our Board, each to serve as directors and as members of the Audit Committee. Effective January 2, 2021, James Sulat was appointed to our Board, to serve as a director and chairperson of the Audit Committee.\nOn March 8, 2021, David R. Walt, Ph.D. notified the Board of his intention not to stand for re-election as a director when his term expires at our upcoming 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nAt-the-Market Offering Agreement\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with BMO Capital Markets Corp., or BMO, with respect to an at the market offering\u201d program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through BMO as our distribution agent. We are not obligated to sell any shares under the equity distribution agreement. As of December 31, 2020, no shares had been sold under the equity distribution agreement.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe audited financial statements of Exicure, Inc. for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, contained herein, include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below.\nSegment Reporting\nWe view our operations and manage our business as one segment, which is the discovery, research and development of treatments based on our SNA technology.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps:\n1.Identify the contract with the customer. A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party's rights and obligations regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer's intent and ability to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer's historical payment experience, or in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n3.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable\nconsideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment.\n4.Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. However, if a series of distinct services that are substantially the same qualifies as a single performance obligation in a contract with variable consideration, we must determine if the variable consideration is attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices.\n5.Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance, (ii) the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. Examples of control are using the asset to produce goods or services, enhance the value of other assets, or settle liabilities, and holding or selling the asset.\nLicenses of intellectual property: If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the licenses. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate the probability of reaching the milestones and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in the future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore revenue recognized is constrained as management is unable to assert that a reversal of revenue would not be possible. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. To date, we have not recognized any milestone payment revenue from any of its collaboration agreements.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its collaboration agreements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have primarily earned revenue under the collaboration agreements with AbbVie and Dermelix (see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nEquity-based compensation\nWe measure the cost of common stock option awards at fair value and record the cost of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We measure fair value for all common stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For all common stock option awards, the fair value measurement date is the date of grant and the requisite service period is the period over which the option recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the common stock option awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including: (1) the estimated grant date fair value of our common stock; (2) the option exercise price; (3) the expected term of the option in years; (4) the annualized volatility of the stock; (5) the risk-free interest rate; and (6) the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock.\nThe expected term is based upon the simplified method\u201d as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14.D.2. Currently, we do not have sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate of an expected term of its common stock options. We will continue to use the simplified method\u201d until there is sufficient experience to provide a more reasonable estimate in conformance with ASC 718-10-30-25 through 30-26. The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate appropriate for the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on calculated enterprise value volatilities for publicly traded companies in the same industry and general stage of development. The estimated forfeiture rates were based on historical experience for similar classes of employees. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nRefer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have earned all of our revenue through December 31, 2020 through our research collaboration license and option agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, our research collaboration, license, and option agreement with Purdue Pharma L.P., or the Purdue Collaboration Agreement, or through our research collaboration license and option agreement with Dermelix. We have also earned revenue as a primary contractor or as a subcontractor on government grants. We do not intend for government grants to be a principal commercial or strategic focus, but will evaluate opportunities when consistent with our strategic priorities. We have not generated any commercial product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future.\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from partnership activities including a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, product sales and royalties, and reimbursement of certain research and development expenses, in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement, or any future collaborations and licenses. We expect that any such revenue we generate will fluctuate in future periods as a result of the timing of achievement, if at all, of preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones, the timing and amount of any payments to us relating to such milestones and the extent to which any of our therapeutic candidates are approved and successfully commercialized by us or potential development partners. If we, or any potential development partner fails to develop therapeutic candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially and adversely affected.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense consists of costs associated with our research activities, including basic research on our SNA platform, discovery and development of novel SNAs as prospective therapeutic candidates, preclinical and clinical development activities for SNAs we have nominated for clinical development as well as maintaining and protecting our intellectual property. Our research and development expenses include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and equity-based compensation expense;\n\u2022early research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants;\n\u2022preclinical and clinical development expenses with third parties such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants;\n\u2022costs of maintaining and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including legal advisory fees, license fees, sublicense fees, patent maintenance and other similar fees;\n\u2022laboratory materials and supplies;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as they are incurred. A significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our therapeutic candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or future development partners may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates. The probability of success for each therapeutic candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.\nAll of our research and development programs are at an early stage and successful development of future therapeutic candidates from these programs is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each future therapeutic candidate and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which therapeutic candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each therapeutic candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the early scientific, preclinical and clinical success of each therapeutic candidate, our ability to maintain or enter into development partnerships with respect to a given therapeutic candidate, as", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as described under the heading Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should review the disclosure under the heading Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nIn addition, this section discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 are not included in this Annual Report and can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics for immuno-oncology, genetic disorders and other indications based on our proprietary Spherical Nucleic Acid, or SNA, technology. SNAs are nanoscale constructs consisting of densely packed synthetic nucleic acid sequences that are radially arranged in three dimensions. We believe the design of our SNAs gives rise to distinct chemical and biological properties that may provide advantages over other nucleic acid therapeutics and enable therapeutic activity outside of the liver. We are conducting IND-enabling studies for XCUR-FXN, an SNA-based therapeutic candidate, for the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia (FA) and expect to initiate a first-in-patient Phase 1b clinical trial in 2022. We are also working to advance our SNA-based therapeutic candidate cavrotolimod (AST-008) in an ongoing Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in cancer patients.\nWe believe that one of the key strengths of our proprietary SNAs is that they have the potential for increased cellular uptake compared to conventional linear oligonucleotides and as a result the potential to achieve higher efficacy at the same doses of oligonucleotide administered. We have shown in clinical and preclinical studies that SNAs may have therapeutic potential in neurology, immuno-oncology and dermatology. In addition, we have shown in preclinical studies that SNAs may have therapeutic potential in ophthalmology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology. As a consequence, we have expanded our pipeline into neurology, and are conducting early stage research activities in ophthalmology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology.\nOperating, financing, and cash flow considerations\nSince our inception in 2011, we have devoted substantial resources to the research and development of SNAs and the protection and enhancement of our intellectual property. We have no products approved for sale and have primarily funded our operations through sales of our securities and collaborations. Through December 31, 2020, we have raised gross proceeds of $190.1 million from the sale of common stock and preferred stock. We have also received $36.0 million in upfront payments under our current collaborations, including an upfront payment of $25.0 million we received in November 2019 in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement and an upfront payment of $1.0 million we received in February 2019 in connection with the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement. On September 25, 2020, we also borrowed $17.5 million under the terms of a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust (as described further below). As of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million.\nSince our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. As of December 31, 2020, we have generated an accumulated deficit of 124.8 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant and increasing losses in the foreseeable future. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u2022continue to advance cavrotolimod (AST-008) through clinical development for immuno-oncology applications;\n\u2022continue research and development of XCUR-FXN and other neurological therapeutic candidates;\n\u2022advance our SNA platform in dermatological indications with suitable collaboration partners;\n\u2022initiate research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional therapeutic candidates that we may pursue in the future;\n\u2022advance other therapeutic candidates through preclinical and clinical development;\n\u2022increase our research and development activities to enhance our technology;\n\u2022continue to manufacture increasing quantities of drug substance and drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our therapeutic candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022acquire or in-license other approved drugs, drug candidates or technologies;\n\u2022hire additional operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nWe have not generated any revenue from commercial drug sales nor do we expect to generate substantial revenue from product sales unless or until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize one or more of our therapeutic candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from drug sales for the next several years, if ever. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our therapeutic candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Other sources of revenue could include a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties in connection with our current and any future collaborations and licenses. Until such time, if ever, that we generate revenue from whatever source, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings and research collaboration and license agreements. We may be unable to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed or on favorable terms. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our therapeutic candidates.\nCOVID-19 Business Update\nWith the global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, we continue to monitor closely the developments and continue to take active measures to protect the health of our employees and their families, our communities, as well as our clinical trial investigators, patients, and caregivers. As of March 5, 2021, Illinois is under Phase 4\u201d of the Restore Illinois Plan, which is intended to permit the expansion of business and community operations based on their compliance with the safety guidelines described in the regulations, with new mitigation measures that may require additional restrictions or adaptations being applied on a regional basis within the State of Illinois based on risk levels depending on the health progress of each region to prevent the ongoing spread of COVID-19.\nBusiness and R&D operations\nUnder social distancing guidelines for COVID-19, we were typically operating with less than 50% of our R&D staff on-site at any one time through June 30, 2020. As of July 1, 2020, we took occupancy of approximately 30,000 square feet of laboratory and office space in our new headquarters in Chicago, Illinois. Since then, we have operated under COVID-19 social distancing guidelines and have generally operated with 100% of our R&D staff on-site. Our office and general and administrative team continues to work predominantly from home. Our preclinical development program in FA is ongoing and we began IND-enabling studies for XCUR-FXN in late 2020. We also continue to progress our collaborations with AbbVie and Dermelix. If the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact or effects continues to persist for an extended period of time, we could experience additional delays in our enrollment of patients for the Phase 2 trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008) and significant disruptions to our preclinical development timelines, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur principal accounting systems are cloud-based and have been fully operational during the stay at home order. We believe that all of our fundamental internal control disciplines are being maintained despite work being conducted from our employees' homes.\nSupply chain\nWe are working closely with our third-party manufacturers and other partners to manage our supply chain activities and mitigate potential disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have observed minor delays in receipt of key chemicals, reagents and materials as certain manufacturers have had supply disruptions, related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time and impacts essential distribution systems such as FedEx and postal delivery, we could experience future disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and our clinical supply, which would adversely impact our preclinical and clinical development activities.\nClinical operations\nWe have one active clinical program, cavrotolimod (AST-008). We have completed enrollment for the Phase 1b stage of the clinical trial and have begun the Phase 2 dose expansion phase in patients with advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. During the third quarter of 2020 and through December 31, 2020, we observed delays in our enrollment plans and clinical trial site start-ups for the Phase 2 dose expansion phase of the trial. We believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact contributed to such delays. As a result, we have taken additional measures to increase the enrollment of patients, including frequent interaction with our clinical trial sites currently open as well as increasing the number of clinical trial sites that potentially are activated for this trial so that we may continue to enroll patients as initially planned. However, these delays have caused us to lengthen our clinical development timeline for cavrotolimod (AST-008), and we now expect to report overall response rate, or ORR, results in the first half of 2022 rather than by year end 2021 as previously guided in September 2020.\nWe remain committed to maintaining our development plans for cavrotolimod (AST-008) and continue to monitor and manage the rapidly evolving situation. We have taken and continue to take measures to implement remote and virtual approaches, including remote patient monitoring where possible, to maintain patient safety and trial continuity and to preserve study integrity. Should the COVID-19 pandemic or its impact or effects continue, our ability to maintain patient enrollment and our clinical development timeline could continue to be negatively impacted. We could also see an impact on our ability to supply study drug, report trial results, or interact with regulators, ethics committees or other important agencies due to limitations in regulatory authority employee resources or otherwise. In addition, we rely on contract research organizations or other third parties to assist us with clinical trials, and we cannot guarantee that they will continue to perform their contractual duties in a timely and satisfactory manner as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist for an extended period of time, we continue to be impacted and could experience additional delays in patient enrollment for our Phase 2 clinical trial of cavrotolimod (AST-008). Any significant disruptions to our clinical development timelines would further delay our anticipated timeline for results and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash were $83.3 million. Based on our current operating plans, we believe that existing working capital at December 31, 2020, including amounts borrowed and available under the MidCap Credit Facility (see below), is sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the date of this report. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us including due to the effects of COVID-19, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. We have historically principally raised capital through the sale of our securities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve and has already resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. We believe raising capital in the current market could be very difficult for early stage biotech companies like us. If the disruption continues to persist and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the future negatively affect our operations.\nRecent Developments\nTherapeutic Development Program Updates\nCavrotolimod (AST-008)\nAs of February 23, 2021, we had 16 clinical trial sites open for enrollment and 7 additional sites pending activation. We expect to open up to 30 sites for the Phase 2 stage of the clinical trial. We anticipate all sites will be activated by the end of 2021. As of February 23, 2021, we had dosed 16 patients with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial, including the primary and exploratory cohorts. Including the six patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial, a total of 22 patients have been dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008). As of February 23, 2021, 1 of the 22 patients dosed with 32 mg of cavrotolimod (AST-008) has experienced a treatment-related SAE as determined by the clinical trial investigator. This patient, enrolled in the Phase 2 stage of the clinical trial, reported a treatment-related SAE of hypotension, flu-like symptoms which subsequently resolved. None of the 14 patients dosed in the Phase 1b portion of the clinical trial with doses of cavrotolimod (AST-008) less than 32 mg experienced a treatment related SAE. Thus, as of February 23, 2021, in total, 1 of 36 patients treated with cavrotolimod (AST-008) have experienced a treatment related SAE.\nChanges in Board of Directors\nEffective March 5, 2021, Elizabeth Garofalo, M.D. and Andrew Sassine were appointed to our Board, each to serve as directors and as members of the Audit Committee. Effective January 2, 2021, James Sulat was appointed to our Board, to serve as a director and chairperson of the Audit Committee.\nOn March 8, 2021, David R. Walt, Ph.D. notified the Board of his intention not to stand for re-election as a director when his term expires at our upcoming 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nAt-the-Market Offering Agreement\nIn December 2020, we entered into an equity distribution agreement with BMO Capital Markets Corp., or BMO, with respect to an at the market offering\u201d program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million through BMO as our distribution agent. We are not obligated to sell any shares under the equity distribution agreement. As of December 31, 2020, no shares had been sold under the equity distribution agreement.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe audited financial statements of Exicure, Inc. for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, contained herein, include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below.\nSegment Reporting\nWe view our operations and manage our business as one segment, which is the discovery, research and development of treatments based on our SNA technology.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the revenue and expenses incurred during the reported periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.\nRevenue recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method for all contracts not completed as of the date of adoption.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when our customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that are within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps:\n1.Identify the contract with the customer. A contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party's rights and obligations regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer's intent and ability to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer's historical payment experience, or in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2.Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, we must apply judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\n3.Determine the transaction price. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, we estimate the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable\nconsideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment.\n4.Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. However, if a series of distinct services that are substantially the same qualifies as a single performance obligation in a contract with variable consideration, we must determine if the variable consideration is attributable to the entire contract or to a specific part of the contract. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices.\n5.Recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. We satisfy performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance, (ii) the entity's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. Examples of control are using the asset to produce goods or services, enhance the value of other assets, or settle liabilities, and holding or selling the asset.\nLicenses of intellectual property: If the license to our intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the licenses. For licenses that are combined with other promises, we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.\nMilestone payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, we evaluate the probability of reaching the milestones and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in the future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore revenue recognized is constrained as management is unable to assert that a reversal of revenue would not be possible. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which we recognize revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. To date, we have not recognized any milestone payment revenue from any of its collaboration agreements.\nRoyalties: For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, we have not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its collaboration agreements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have primarily earned revenue under the collaboration agreements with AbbVie and Dermelix (see Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nEquity-based compensation\nWe measure the cost of common stock option awards at fair value and record the cost of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We measure fair value for all common stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For all common stock option awards, the fair value measurement date is the date of grant and the requisite service period is the period over which the option recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the common stock option awards, which is generally the vesting period.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including: (1) the estimated grant date fair value of our common stock; (2) the option exercise price; (3) the expected term of the option in years; (4) the annualized volatility of the stock; (5) the risk-free interest rate; and (6) the annual rate of quarterly dividends on the stock.\nThe expected term is based upon the simplified method\u201d as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14.D.2. Currently, we do not have sufficient experience to provide a reasonable estimate of an expected term of its common stock options. We will continue to use the simplified method\u201d until there is sufficient experience to provide a more reasonable estimate in conformance with ASC 718-10-30-25 through 30-26. The risk-free interest rate assumptions were based on the U.S. Treasury bond rate appropriate for the expected term in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on calculated enterprise value volatilities for publicly traded companies in the same industry and general stage of development. The estimated forfeiture rates were based on historical experience for similar classes of employees. The dividend yield was based on expected dividends at the time of grant.\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements.\nRecent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nRefer to Note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted.\nComponents of Statements of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have earned all of our revenue through December 31, 2020 through our research collaboration license and option agreement with AbbVie, or the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, our research collaboration, license, and option agreement with Purdue Pharma L.P., or the Purdue Collaboration Agreement, or through our research collaboration license and option agreement with Dermelix. We have also earned revenue as a primary contractor or as a subcontractor on government grants. We do not intend for government grants to be a principal commercial or strategic focus, but will evaluate opportunities when consistent with our strategic priorities. We have not generated any commercial product revenue and do not expect to generate any product revenue for the foreseeable future.\nIn the future, we may generate revenue from partnership activities including a combination of research and development payments, license fees and other upfront payments, milestone payments, product sales and royalties, and reimbursement of certain research and development expenses, in connection with the AbbVie Collaboration Agreement, the Dermelix Collaboration Agreement, or any future collaborations and licenses. We expect that any such revenue we generate will fluctuate in future periods as a result of the timing of achievement, if at all, of preclinical, clinical, regulatory and commercialization milestones, the timing and amount of any payments to us relating to such milestones and the extent to which any of our therapeutic candidates are approved and successfully commercialized by us or potential development partners. If we, or any potential development partner fails to develop therapeutic candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenue, and our results of operations and financial position, would be materially and adversely affected.\nResearch and development expense\nResearch and development expense consists of costs associated with our research activities, including basic research on our SNA platform, discovery and development of novel SNAs as prospective therapeutic candidates, preclinical and clinical development activities for SNAs we have nominated for clinical development as well as maintaining and protecting our intellectual property. Our research and development expenses include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and equity-based compensation expense;\n\u2022early research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants;\n\u2022preclinical and clinical development expenses with third parties such as contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, and consultants;\n\u2022costs of maintaining and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including legal advisory fees, license fees, sublicense fees, patent maintenance and other similar fees;\n\u2022laboratory materials and supplies;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies.\nWe expense research and development costs as they are incurred. A significant portion of our research and development costs are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technology.\nWe expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance our therapeutic candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials. The process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We or future development partners may never succeed in obtaining marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates. The probability of success for each therapeutic candidate may be affected by numerous factors, including preclinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.\nAll of our research and development programs are at an early stage and successful development of future therapeutic candidates from these programs is highly uncertain and may not result in approved products. Completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each future therapeutic candidate and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which therapeutic candidates to pursue and how much funding to direct to each therapeutic candidate on an ongoing basis in response to the early scientific, preclinical and clinical success of each therapeutic candidate, our ability to maintain or enter into development partnerships with respect to a given therapeutic candidate, as"}
