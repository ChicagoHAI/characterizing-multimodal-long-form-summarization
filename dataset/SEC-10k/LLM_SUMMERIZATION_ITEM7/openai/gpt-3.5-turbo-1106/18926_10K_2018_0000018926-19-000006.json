MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll references to \"Notes\" in this Item 7 of Part II refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Item 1 of Part I of this report for factors relating to these statements and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.\nOverview\nWe are an international facilities-based communications company engaged primarily in providing a broad array of integrated services to our residential and business customers. With approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally, we believe we are among the largest providers of communications services to domestic and global enterprise customers and the third largest wireline telecommunications company in the United States. We provide services in over 60 countries, with most of our revenue being derived in the United States.\nAt December 31, 2018, we served 4.8 million consumer broadband subscribers. Our methodology for counting consumer broadband subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies. We no longer report or discuss access lines as a key operating metric given the significant migration in our industry from legacy services to IP-enabled services.\nAcquisition of Level 3\nOn November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. (\"CenturyLink\") acquired Level 3 Communications, Inc. (\"Level 3\") through successive merger transactions, including a merger of Level 3 with and into a merger subsidiary, which survived such merger as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary under the name of Level 3 Parent, LLC.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $391 million of integration-related expenses associated with our activities related to the Level 3 acquisition. During 2018, we also recognized $2 million in merger-related transaction costs, including investment banker and legal fees.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyLink and its majority owned subsidiaries, including Level 3 beginning on November 1, 2017. Due to the significant size of the acquisition, direct comparison of our results of operations for the periods ending on or after December 31, 2017 to prior periods are less meaningful than usual.\nAs a result of the acquisition, Level 3's assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their fair value. The assignment of estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment. The use of fair value measures affects the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. We completed our final fair value determinations during the fourth quarter 2018. Our final fair value determinations were different than those preliminary values reflected in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017 and resulted in an increase in goodwill of $340 million and an increase to other noncurrent assets offset by a decrease in customer relationships during 2018.\nIn the discussion that follows, we refer to the business that we operated prior to the Level 3 acquisition as \"Legacy CenturyLink\", and we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Level 3 acquisition as \"Legacy Level 3.\"\nFor additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see (i) Note 2-Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and (ii) the documents we filed with the SEC on February 13, 2017, November 1, 2017 and January 16, 2018.\nSale of Data Centers and Colocation Business\nOn May 1, 2017, we sold our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital (\"the Purchaser\") in exchange for pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion and a minority stake in the limited partnership that owns the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company, Cyxtera Technologies. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser acquired 57 of our data centers and assumed our capital lease obligations, which amounted to $294 million on May 1, 2017, related to the divested properties.\nOur colocation business generated revenue (excluding revenue from affiliates) of $210 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, and $622 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (a small portion of which has been retained by us).\nThis transaction did not meet the accounting requirements for a sale-leaseback transaction as described in ASC 840-40, Leases - Sale-Leaseback Transaction. Under the failed-sale-leaseback accounting model, we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to the Purchaser.\nAfter factoring in the costs to sell the data centers and colocation business, excluding the impacts from the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment, the sale resulted in a $20 million gain as a result of the aggregate value of the consideration we received exceeding the carrying value of the assets sold and liabilities assumed. Based on the fair market values of the failed-sale-leaseback assets, the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment resulted in a loss of $102 million as a result of the requirement to treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation. The combined net loss of $82 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEffective with the January 1, 2019 implementation date of the new accounting standard for Leases (ASU 2016-02), this particular accounting treatment will no longer be applicable to our May 1, 2017 divestiture transaction. Consequently, the above-described real estate assets and corresponding financing obligation will be derecognized as of January 1, 2019 from our future consolidated balance sheets resulting in an increase of $115 million to stockholder's equity.\nSee Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business for additional information on the sale and Note 1- Background And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion of the impact of implementing ASU 2016-02 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nSegments\nAt December 31, 2018, we had the following two segments:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Business Segment.

</tr>\n</table>\nOur total operating revenue increased by $5.8 billion, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the inclusion of $6.7 billion in Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition operating revenue in our consolidated operating revenue. Total operating revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $935 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The Legacy CenturyLink decline in total operating revenue is primarily due to lower voice and collaboration, transport and infrastructure and IP and data services revenue. The decrease in voice and collaboration was due to continued decreases in revenue from our traditional voice telecommunications services. The decrease in transport and infrastructure reflects the decrease in volumes from our colocation business sale, reduced sales volume of private line (including business data services) services, which were partially offset with an increase in broadband and managed security services. The decrease in IP and data services was primarily due to a decrease in retail revenue, partially offset by an increase in VPN data network services.\nTotal operating revenue increased by $186 million, or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the inclusion of $1.4 billion in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 operating revenue in our 2017 consolidated operating revenue. Total operating revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decline in total operating revenue reflects the continuing loss of access lines, loss of long-distance revenue primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions in the volume of our private line (including business data services) services. Our total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 were also impacted by the May 1, 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation business, which resulted in a reduction of colocation revenue of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period.\nFurther analysis of our segment operating revenue and trends impacting our performance are provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers.

The increase in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of $3.2 billion Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased $588 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee related expenses from lower headcount, reduced overtime, lower real estate and power expenses and a decline in content costs for Prism TV.\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $429 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of $690 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $261 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount and healthcare costs, lower real estate and power expenses from the sale of the data centers and colocation business, and reduced customer premises equipment costs due to a decrease in sales of customer premises equipment and USF rates, which were partially offset by increases in facility costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $657 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was attributable to the inclusion of $1.1 billion Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $444 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to (i) reductions in salaries and wages and employee related expenses from lower headcount, (ii) reduced overtime, professional fees, bad debt and marketing expenses and (iii) a loss on sale of data centers in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $61 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $253 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 expenses (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. Legacy CenturyLink's selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $192 million, or 6%, primarily due to (i) reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount, (ii) reduced healthcare, external commissions and bad debt expenses and (iii) losses recognized from the sale of our data centers and colocation business and the related failed-sale-leaseback as further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and increases in transaction and integration costs associated with the Level 3 acquisition.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following tables provide detail of our depreciation and amortization expense: Table 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>1,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant (including from the acquisition of Level 3) and the divestiture of plant (including from sale of our data centers and colocation business). Depreciation expense increased by $629 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of $763 million Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition depreciation expense in our consolidated depreciation expense, which was partially offset by lower Legacy CenturyLink depreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $143 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 depreciation expense in our consolidated depreciation expense. Legacy CenturyLink's depreciation expense was lower due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant previously placed in service. Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business in late 2016. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation expense of $54 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017 related to the conveyed property. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service since January 1, 2016. As a result of not meeting sale-leaseback accounting requirements, prior to January 1, 2019 we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to Cyxtera; therefore, we are required to reflect a portion of the real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet and depreciate these assets over their useful lives. As further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business, of the $91 million increase in depreciation expense on these real estate assets, $44 million is not expected to recur in future periods.\nAmortization expense increased by $555 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $659 million and $139 million, respectively, in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 amortization expense in our consolidated amortization expense. Legacy CenturyLink's amortization expense was lower for both periods primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense each period as the intangible assets amortize. In 2017, we ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have recorded additional amortization expense of $13 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, related to the conveyed intangible assets. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nAt October 31, 2018, we estimated the fair value of our five reporting units, which we determined to be consumer, medium and small business, enterprise, international and global accounts and wholesale and indirect, by considering both a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach method includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the reporting units beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. We reconciled the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of October 31, 2018 and concluded that the indicated control premium of approximately 0.1% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place.\nAs of October 31, 2018, based on our assessment performed with respect to these reporting units as described above, we concluded that the estimated fair value of our consumer reporting unit was less than our carrying value of equity for such unit by approximately $2.7 billion. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.7 billion for goodwill assigned to our consumer segment during the fourth quarter of 2018. After the impairment charge described above, the estimated fair value of equity for our consumer segment equals the carrying value of equity for such segment.\nOther Consolidated Results\nThe following tables summarize our total other expense, net and income tax expense (benefit): Table 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(849\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,318\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,313\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (benefit) expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(849\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,243\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________ Table 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>nm\n</td> <td>Percentages greater than 200% and comparisons between positive and negative values or to/from zero values are considered not meaningful.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $696 million, or 47%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to our issuance and assumption of debt in conjunction with the acquisition of Level 3. Interest expense increased by $163 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to (i) the issuance of $7.9 billion of term loans in 2017 for the purpose of providing funding for the Level 3 acquisition, (ii) the assumption of Level 3's debt upon the consummation of the acquisition of Level 3, which accounted for $80 million in post-acquisition interest expense and (iii) the recognition of imputed interest expense resulting from the failed-sale-leaseback as further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations, including our share of income from partnerships we do not control, interest income, gains and losses from non-operating asset dispositions, foreign currency gains and losses and components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs. Other income, net increased by $32 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to a decrease in pension service charges in 2018. Other income, net increased by $7 million, or 140%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase in other income, net was primarily due to a reduction in the loss on early retirement of debt, an increase in interest income from the $6 billion Term Loan B funds held in escrow and income generated from our services agreements with Cyxtera, which was substantially offset by a lower expected return on assets in 2017 for our pension and post-retirement plans. The expected return on assets for our pension and post-retirement plans was lower in 2017 as compared to 2016, which resulted in us recording pension and post-retirement expense in 2017 as compared to recording pension and post-retirement income in 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was the predominant factor contributing to our recognition of an $849 million income tax benefit for 2017, versus income tax expense of $394 million in the prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, our effective income tax rate was (10.9)%, (157.2)% and 38.6%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a $572 million unfavorable impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment as well as the current year unfavorable impact of purchase price accounting adjustments resulting from the Level 3 acquisition and from the tax reform impact of those adjustments of $92 million. The 2018 unfavorable impacts are partially offset by the tax benefit of a 2017 tax loss carryback to 2016 of $142 million. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects the benefit from the re-measurement of deferred taxes as noted above, a $27 million tax expense related to the sale of our data centers and colocation business and a $32 million tax impact of non-deductible transaction costs related to the Level 3 acquisition. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 reflects a tax impact of $18 million from an intercompany dividend payment from one of our foreign subsidiaries to its domestic parent company that was made as part of our corporate restructuring in preparation for the sale of our colocation business. See Note 14-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Income Taxes\" below for additional information.\nSegment Results\nThe results for our business and consumer segments are summarized below for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Table 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,766\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment expenses\n</td> <td>12,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total margin percentage\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>10,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin percentage\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer segment:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,062\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenses\n</td> <td>2,193\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Margin percentage\n</td> <td>59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProducts and Services\nIn connection with our acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, we revised the way we categorize our products and services and now report our related revenue under the following categories: IP and data services, transport and infrastructure, voice and collaboration, IT and managed services and regulatory revenue. As a result of organization changes made in January 2019, we are making certain changes to revenue reporting categories in 2019 in our business and consumer segments to align with how the business is being managed as discussed further below.\nWe offer our customers the ability to bundle together several products and services. We believe our customers value the convenience and price discounts associated with receiving multiple services through a single company.\nBusiness Segment\nThe operations of our business segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\nRevenue. Our mix of total business segment revenue continues to migrate from traditional wireline voice services to newer, lower cost and more technologically advanced products and services as our small, medium and enterprise business, wholesale and government customers increasingly demand integrated data, broadband, hosting and voice services. Our Ethernet-based services in the wholesale market face competition from cable companies and competitive fiber-based telecommunications providers. We anticipate continued pricing pressure for our colocation services as our competitors continue to expand their enterprise colocation operations. In recent years, our competitors, as well as several large, diversified technology companies, have made substantial investments in cloud computing. This expansion in competitive cloud computing offerings has led to increased pricing pressure, a migration towards lower-priced cloud-based services and enhanced competition for contracts, and we expect these trends to continue. Customers' demand for new technology has also increased the number of competitors offering services similar to ours. Price compression from each of these above-mentioned competitive pressures has negatively impacted the operating margins of certain business product and service offerings, and we expect this trend to continue. Our traditional wireline products and services revenue have been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and price compression. In particular, our access, local services and long-distance revenue have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by customer migration to more technologically advanced services, a substantial increase in the use of non-voice communications, industry consolidation and price compression caused by regulation and rate reductions. For example, many of our business segment customers are substituting cable, wireless and Voice over Internet Protocol (\"VoIP\") services for traditional voice telecommunications services, resulting in continued access revenue loss. Demand for our private line services (including business data services) continues to decline due to our customers' optimization of their networks, industry consolidation and technological migration to higher-speed services. Although our traditional wireline services generally face fewer direct competitors than certain of our newer, lower cost more advanced products and services, customer migration and, to a lesser degree, price compression from competitive pressures have negatively impacted our traditional wireline revenue and the operating margins of these services. We expect this trend to continue. We expect both equipment sales and professional services revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from year to year as this offering tends to be more sensitive than others to changes in the economy and in spending trends of our federal, state and local government customers, many of whom have experienced substantial budget cuts over the past several years, with the possibility of additional future budget cuts.\nExpenses. Our operating costs also impact the operating margins of all of our above-mentioned services, but to a lesser extent than price compression and customer disconnects. These operating costs include employee costs, sales commissions, software costs on selected services, installation costs and third-party facility costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on the operating margins of some of our newer, more technologically advanced services as compared to our traditional wireline services, principally because those newer services rely more heavily upon the above-listed support functions. Operating costs, such as installation costs and third-party facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our traditional wireline products and services, but to a lesser extent than customer loss, customer migration and price compression.\nOperating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions, while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation. However, our ongoing efforts to increase revenue will continue to require that we incur higher costs in some areas. We also expect our business segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.\nThe following tables summarize the results of operations from our business segment: Table 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the inclusion of $6.7 billion in Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition business segment revenue in our consolidated business segment revenue. Business segment revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $571 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline in Legacy CenturyLink business segment revenue for year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to lower transport and infrastructure and voice and collaboration revenue services. The transport and infrastructure decrease was primarily due to reductions in private line (including business data services) revenue while the decrease in voice and collaboration was due to continued decreases in revenue from our traditional voice telecommunications services.\nBusiness segment revenue increased by $516 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the inclusion of $1.4 billion in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 business segment revenue in our consolidated business segment revenue. Business segment revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $874 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decline in business segment revenue for year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to a reduction in access lines and lower volumes of long-distance and access services resulting from the competitive and technological factors noted above and to reductions in the volume of private line (including business data services) services. Our business segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was also impacted by the May 1, 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation business, which resulted in a reduction of colocation revenue of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period.\nThe following tables summarize the results of operations from our business segment by customer sales channel:\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Business Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenue by customer sales channel:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medium and small business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise\n</td> <td>5,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International and global accounts\n</td> <td>3,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale and indirect\n</td> <td>5,046\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colocation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenue by customer sales channel:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Business Segment\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment revenue by customer sales channel:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medium and small business\n</td> <td>3,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Enterprise\n</td> <td>3,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International and global accounts\n</td> <td>1,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale and indirect\n</td> <td>3,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Colocation\n</td> <td>171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment revenue by customer sales channel:\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2019, we intend to make the following reporting changes for the business segment. The indirect channel, which primarily targets small to medium-sized enterprises, will move from the Wholesale and Indirect Business unit to the Small and Medium Business unit. The company is also moving State and Local Government customers from the Small and Medium Business unit to the Enterprise Business unit to gain efficiencies by managing all government customers in a single organization.\nIn addition, the new reporting structure reflects changes made to customer assignments between all five customer-facing business units.\nSegment Expenses\nBusiness segment expenses increased by $3.2 billion, or 47%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of $3.7 billion in Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition business segment expenses in our consolidated business segment expenses. Business segment expenses for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $504 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decline in business segment expenses for Legacy CenturyLink was primarily due to decreased salaries and wages from lower headcount, a reduction of expenses generated by our colocation business and decreased Level 3 pre-acquisition expenses paid by CenturyLink during the first 10 months of 2017. Business segment expenses for Legacy CenturyLink increased by $456 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of $749 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 business segment expenses in our consolidated business segment expenses. Business segment expenses for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $293 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount, real estate and power costs due to the sale of the data centers and colocation business, marketing and advertising expenses and network expense. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in facility costs.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nBusiness segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.9 billion, or 66%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the inclusion of Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition business segment adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion. Business segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $60 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the inclusion of $641 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 business segment adjusted EBITDA. The decrease of $581 million in Legacy CenturyLink business segment adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was due to the loss of customers, lower service volumes and the loss of income generated by our colocation business.\nConsumer Segment\nThe operations of our consumer segment have been impacted by several significant trends, including those described below:\nRevenue. In order to remain competitive and attract additional residential broadband subscribers, we believe it is important to continually increase our broadband network's scope and connection speeds. As a result, we continue to invest in our broadband network, which allows for the delivery of higher-speed broadband services to a greater number of customers. We compete in a maturing broadband market in which most consumers already have broadband services and growth rates in new subscribers have slowed or declined. Moreover, as described further in Item 1A of Part I of this report, certain of our competitors continue to provide broadband services at generally higher average transmission speeds than ours or through advanced wireless data service offerings, both of which we believe have impacted the competitiveness of certain of our broadband offerings in certain of our markets. Our voice revenue has been, and we expect they will continue to be, adversely affected by access line losses and lower long-distance voice service volumes. Intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses. For example, many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice services and electronic mail, texting and social networking non-voice services for traditional voice telecommunications services. We expect our video revenue to continue to decline, particularly due to our decision to discontinue active marketing of our facilities-based video services in light of competitive pressures and escalating content costs. The demand for new technology has increased the number of competitors offering services similar to ours. Price compression and new technology from our competitors have negatively impacted the operating margins of our newer, more technologically advanced products and services. We expect that these factors will continue to negatively impact our business. As a result of the expected loss of higher margin services associated with access lines, we continue to offer our customers service bundling and other product promotions to help mitigate this trend, as described below. Customer migration and price compression from competitive pressures have not only negatively impacted our traditional wireline services revenue, but they have also negatively impacted the operating margins of these services and we expect this trend to continue.\nAdditionally, we plan to make changes to the service type reporting to make it easier for investors to evaluate changes to consumer product revenue.\nWe plan to report consumer revenue in the following categories: broadband; voice; regulatory (includes CAF II and other support funds); and other, which includes retail video and other miscellaneous services.\nExpenses. Operating costs also impact the operating margins of these services. These operating costs include employee costs, marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, TV content costs and installation costs. We believe increases in operating costs have generally had a greater impact on our operating margins of our newer, more technologically advanced products and services as compared to our traditional wireline services, principally because our newer, more technologically advanced products and services rely more heavily upon the above-listed operating expenses. Operating costs, such as installation costs and facility costs, have also negatively impacted the operating margins of our traditional wireline products and services, but to a lesser extent than customer migration and price compression. Operating costs also tend to impact our traditional wireline products and services margins to a lesser extent than our newer, more technologically advanced products and services as noted above.\nService bundling and product promotions. We offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services. These customers can bundle broadband services with other services such as local voice, video and long-distance. While we believe our bundled service offerings can help retain customers, they also tend to lower our profit margins in the consumer segment due to the related discounts; and\nOperating efficiencies. We continue to evaluate our segment operating structure and focus. This involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements, productivity improvements and changes in industry, competitive, technological and regulatory conditions. We also expect our consumer segment to benefit indirectly from enhanced efficiencies in our company-wide network operations.\nThe following tables summarize the results of operations from our consumer

segment revenue decreased by $333 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and by $358 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decline in consumer segment services revenue during each year was primarily due to lower local and long-distance voice service volumes associated with access line losses resulting from the competitive and technological factors noted above and a decrease in the number of Prism TV customers.\nSegment Expenses\nConsumer segment expenses decreased by $350 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in our consumer segment expenses was primarily due to lower salaries and wages from a reduction in headcount, decreases in marketing expenses and lower network expense in response to a smaller customer base. Consumer segment expenses decreased by $147 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease in our consumer segment expenses was primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount, external commissions and USF surcharges from rate decreases, which were partially offset by increases in marketing and advertising expenses.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA\nConsumer segment adjusted EBITDA increased by $17 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in our consumer segment adjusted EBITDA was due predominantly to decreased segment expenses related to reduction in headcount, lower marketing and network expenses. Consumer segment adjusted EBITDA decreased $211 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decline in our consumer segment adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to loss of customers and increases in the costs associated with Prism TV.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. We have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to (i) business combinations, (ii) goodwill, customer relationships and other intangible assets; (iii) property, plant and equipment; (iv) pension and post-retirement benefits; (v) loss contingencies and litigation reserves and (vi) income taxes. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or they have the potential to have a material impact, on our consolidated financial statements and because they require us to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below were reasonable, based on information available at the time they were made. However, there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nBusiness Combination\nWe have accounted for our acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, under the acquisition method of accounting, whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date. The portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill. The fair value and resulting assignment of the purchase price related to our acquisition of Level 3 involved significant estimates and judgments by our management. In arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we considered the following generally accepted valuation approaches: the cost approach, income approach and market approach. Our estimates also included assumptions about projected growth rates, cost of capital, effective tax rates, tax amortization periods, technology life cycles, customer attrition rates, the regulatory and legal environment and industry and economic trends. For additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see Note 2-Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nGoodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets\nWe amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of 7 to 15 years, using either the sum-of-years-digits or the straight-line methods, depending on the customer retention patterns for the type of customer at the companies we acquire. We amortize capitalized software using the straight-line method over estimated lives ranging up to 7 years, except for approximately $237 million of our capitalized software costs, which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system which is amortized using the straight-line method over a 20-year period. We annually review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets, primarily capitalized software. The amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts, depending on the results of our annual reviews.\nOur goodwill was derived from numerous acquisitions where the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.\nWe are required to reassign goodwill to reporting units each time we reorganize our internal reporting structure which causes a change in the composition of our reporting units. We assign goodwill to the reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We utilize the trailing twelve-months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as our allocation methodology as we believe that it represents a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the operations being reorganized. The use of other fair value assignment methods could result in materially different results. For additional information on our segments, see Note 15-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nWe are required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate an impairment may have occurred. We are required to write-down the value of goodwill in periods in which the carrying value of equity exceeds the fair value of equity. Our reporting units are not discrete legal entities with discrete full financial statements. Our assets and liabilities are employed in and relate to the operations of our reporting units. Therefore, the equity carrying value and future cash flows must be estimated each time a goodwill impairment analysis is performed on a reporting unit. As a result, our assets, liabilities and cash flows are assigned to reporting units using reasonable and consistent allocation methodologies. Certain estimates, judgments and assumptions are required to perform these assignments. We believe these estimates, judgments and assumptions to be reasonable, but changes in any of these can significantly affect each reporting unit's equity carrying value and future cash flows utilized for our goodwill impairment test. We consider both a market approach and a discounted cash flow method which are weighted equally. The market approach method includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours and the discounted cash flow method uses a market participant's weighted average cost of capital. Our annual assessment date for testing goodwill impairment is October 31.\nAs of October 31, 2018, we assessed goodwill for impairment for our five reporting units, which we determined to be consumer, medium and small business, enterprise, international and global accounts, and wholesale and indirect. We determined that the carrying value of our consumer reporting unit's equity was substantially above its estimated fair value of equity by approximately $2.7 billion. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.7 billion for goodwill assigned to our consumer reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nAs of October 31, 2018, based on our assessment performed with respect to our four reporting units included in our business segment, the estimated fair value of our equity exceeded our carrying value of equity for our medium and small business, enterprise, international and global accounts and wholesale and indirect by 2%, 11%, 30% and 5%, respectively. After the impairment charge described above, the estimated fair value of equity for our consumer reporting unit equals the carrying value of equity for such unit.\nFor additional information on our goodwill balances by segment, see Note 4-Goodwill, Customer Relationships and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nAs a result of the reporting unit changes we made in January 2019, we intend to perform a goodwill impairment analysis during the first quarter of 2019. We may also be required to assess our goodwill for impairment before our next required assessment date of October 31, 2019 under certain circumstances, including any failure to meet our forecasted future operating results or any significant increases in our weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we cannot assure you that adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment assessments or impairment charges. A number of factors, many of which we cannot control, could affect our financial condition, operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to, (i) weakening in the overall economy or in any of the markets in which we operate; (ii) a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization as a result of an adverse change to our overall business operations; (iii) changes in the discount rate we use in our testing; (iv) successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets; (v) adverse changes as a result of regulatory or legislative actions; (vi) a significant adverse change in our legal affairs or in the overall business climate; and (vii) recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of one or more of our subsidiaries that are a component of our segments. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report. We will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required assessment date of October 31, 2019.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its estimated fair value as of its acquisition date, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, plus the estimated value of any associated legally or contractually required asset retirement obligation. Renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs, as well as renewals of minor items, are charged to operating expense. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided on the straight-line method specific unit or group method using class or overall group rates and specific asset life. The group method provides for the recognition of the remaining net investment, less anticipated net salvage value, over the remaining useful life of the assets. This method requires the periodic revision of depreciation rates.\nNormal retirements of property, plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation, with no gain or loss recognized. We depreciate such property on the straight-line method over estimated service lives ranging from 3 to 45 years.\nWe perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of the depreciable lives for our property, plant and equipment. Our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, assumptions about technology evolution and, in certain instances, actuarially determined probabilities to estimate the remaining life of our asset base.\nDue to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment, determining the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant and equipment requires a significant amount of judgment. We regularly review data on utilization of equipment, asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates. The effect of a hypothetical one year increase or decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives of our property, plant and equipment would have decreased depreciation expense by approximately $410 million annually or increased depreciation expense by approximately $530 million annually, respectively.\nPension and Post-retirement Benefits\nWe sponsor a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan (referred to as our qualified pension plan) for a substantial portion of our employees. In addition to this tax-qualified pension plan, we also maintain several non-qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees. We also maintain post-retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. On November 1, 2017, we assumed Level 3's pension and post-retirement plans, and certain obligations associated with these plans. Due to the insignificant impact of these plans on our consolidated financial statements, we have excluded them from the following pension and post-retirement benefits disclosures for 2018 and 2017.\nIn 2018, approximately 55% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2018 net actuarial loss balance of $2.9 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 8 to 9 years for the plan. The other 45% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2018. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $248 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2018.\nIn 2017, approximately 58% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2017 net actuarial loss balance of $3.1 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the plan. The other 42% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2017. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $137 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2017.\nIn 2016, approximately 53% of the qualified pension plan's January 1, 2016 net actuarial loss balance of $2.8 billion was subject to amortization as a component of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits, which ranges from 9 to 10 years for the plan. The other 47% of the qualified pension plan's beginning net actuarial loss balance was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016. The entire beginning net actuarial loss of $147 million for the post-retirement benefit plans was treated as indefinitely deferred during 2016.\nIn computing our pension and post-retirement health care and life insurance benefit obligations, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and mortality rates. In computing our periodic pension and post-retirement benefit expense, our most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets.\nThe discount rate for each plan is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the plan's benefit obligations as of the end of the year. We selected each plan's discount rate based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves from U.S. corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans. This process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments as is generated by discounting each year's benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year. The spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the 60th to 90th percentile of U.S. high quality bonds.\nMortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on historical demographic studies by the Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\"). The SOA publishes new mortality rates (mortality tables and projection scales) on a regular basis which reflect updates to projected life expectancies in North America. Historically, we have adopted the new projection tables immediately after publication. In 2017, we adopted the revised morality tables and projection scale released by the SOA, which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $113 million. In 2016, we adopted the revised mortality table and projection scale released by the SOA, which decreased the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans by $268 million. The change in the projected benefit obligation of our benefit plans was recognized as part of the net actuarial loss and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a portion of which is subject to amortization over the remaining estimated life of plan participants, which was approximately 17 years as of December 31, 2018.\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is the long-term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans' assets in the future, net of administrative expenses paid from plan assets. The rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long-term risk and return forecast for each asset class. The forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long-term expectations of various third-party investment management organizations to which we then add a factor of 50 basis points to reflect the benefit we expect to result from our active management of the assets. The expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised, as necessary, to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy.\nTo compute the expected return on pension and post-retirement benefit plan assets, we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the post-retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets. Annual market volatility for these assets (higher or lower than expected return) is reflected in the net actuarial losses.\nChanges in any of the above factors could significantly impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss of stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheets. The expected return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post-retirement benefit expense.\nLoss Contingencies and Litigation Reserves\nWe are involved in several material legal proceedings, as described in more detail in Note 17-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. We periodically assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters. For matters not related to income taxes, if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we recognize an expense for the estimated loss. To the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters, our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly. If the differences are material, our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted.\nFor matters related to income taxes, if we determine in our judgment that the impact of an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority, then we recognize in our financial statements a benefit for the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if we determine in our judgment that the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Though the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. Because of this, whether a tax position will ultimately be sustained may be uncertain.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax credit carryforwards, differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax basis of those assets and liabilities and tax net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs. Deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe measurement of deferred taxes often involves the exercise of considerable judgment related to the realization of tax basis. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken in filed tax returns and the resulting tax basis are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities. Assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate. Any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with recording deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate in light of changes in facts or circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. In making this evaluation, we rely on our recent history of pre-tax earnings. We also rely on our forecasts of future earnings and the nature and timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets, all which involve the exercise of significant judgment. At December 31, 2018, we established a valuation allowance of $1.3 billion primarily related to foreign and state NOLs, as it is more likely than not that these NOLs will expire unused. If forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future, we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate, which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 14-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Sources and Uses of Cash\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our parent company liquidity requirements. Several of our significant operating subsidiaries have borrowed funds either on a standalone basis or as part of a separate restricted group with certain of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The terms of the instruments governing the indebtedness of these borrowers or borrowing groups may restrict our ability to access their accumulated cash. In addition, our ability to access the liquidity of these and other subsidiaries may be limited by tax and legal considerations and other factors.\nAt December 31, 2018, we held cash and cash equivalents of $488 million and we had approximately $1.6 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. We had approximately $108 million of cash and cash equivalents outside the United States at December 31, 2018. We currently believe we have the ability to repatriate cash and cash equivalents into the United States without paying or accruing U.S. taxes, other than the possible payment of the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax discussed elsewhere herein and other limited exceptions. We do not currently intend to repatriate to the United States any of our foreign cash and cash equivalents from operating entities outside of Latin America. We have no material restrictions on our ability to repatriate to the United States foreign cash and cash equivalents.\nOur executive officers and our Board of Directors periodically review our sources and potential uses of cash in connection with our annual budgeting process. Generally speaking, our principal funding source is cash from operating activities, and our principal cash requirements include operating expenses, capital expenditures, income taxes, debt repayments, dividends, periodic stock repurchases, periodic pension contributions and other benefits payments. As discussed further below, the amount of cash we paid in 2018 for retiree healthcare benefits increased substantially compared to prior periods. We currently expect that our cash paid for retiree healthcare benefits in 2019 will remain flat.\nBased on our current capital allocation objectives, during 2019 we project expending approximately $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion (excluding integration capital) of cash for capital investment in property, plant and equipment and approximately $1.1 billion of cash for dividends on our common stock (based on the assumptions described below under \"Dividends\"). At December 31, 2018, we had debt maturities of $400 million, scheduled debt principal payments of $164 million and capital lease and other fixed payments of $88 million, each due during 2019. Each of the expenditures is described further below.\nWe will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that we will make adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, as and if determined by our Board of Directors. We typically use our revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity for operating activities and our other cash requirements.\nFor additional information, see \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\".\nCapital Expenditures\nWe incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks, compete effectively in our markets, expand and improve our service offerings. We evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors, including expected strategic impacts (such as forecasted impact on revenue growth, productivity, expenses, service levels and customer retention) and our expected return on investment. The amount of capital investment is influenced by, among other things, demand for our services and products, cash flow generated by operating activities, cash required for other purposes and regulatory considerations (such as our CAF Phase II infrastructure buildout requirements). Based on current circumstances, we estimate that our total capital expenditures for 2019 will be approximately $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion, inclusive of CAF Phase II related capital expenditures, but excluding integration capital.\nOur capital expenditures continue to be focused on keeping the network operating efficiently and supporting new service developments. For more information on our capital spending, see \"Historical Information-Investing Activities\" below and Item 1 of Part 1 of this report.\nDebt and Other Financing Arrangements\nSubject to market conditions, we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt, including issuing Qwest Corporation and Level 3 Financing, Inc. debt securities to refinance their maturing debt to the extent feasible. The availability, interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned by credit rating agencies, among other factors.\nFollowing the closing of our acquisition of Level 3, the rating agencies took action on the ratings of the debt in the table below. Generally, the agencies downgraded ratings of the CenturyLink, Inc. debt from previous levels as they indicated they intended to at the time of the announcement of the transaction. Additionally, immediately following the Level 3 acquisition, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's placed such ratings on negative outlook while Fitch Ratings placed them on stable outlook. As for the Level 3 debt, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. upgraded the unsecured debt and affirmed the rating of the secured debt, with all ratings placed on negative outlook. Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings affirmed all previous Level 3 ratings with stable outlook.\nOn February 14, 2019, Standard and Poor's revised its outlook on all CenturyLink, Inc. credit ratings from negative to stable. As of the date of this report, the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of CenturyLink, Inc., Qwest Corporation, Level 3 Parent, LLC and Level 3 Financing, Inc. were as follows:\nTable 221: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrower\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Moody's Investors Service, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fitch Ratings\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CenturyLink, Inc.:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Qwest Corporation:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB+\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3 Parent, LLC:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>B+\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3 Financing, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unsecured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BB\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Secured\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Ba1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BBB-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur credit ratings are reviewed and adjusted from time to time by the rating agencies. Any future downgrades of the senior unsecured or secured debt ratings of us or our subsidiaries could impact our access to debt capital or further raise our borrowing costs. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.\nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2018, CenturyLink had approximately $7.3 billion of net operating loss carryforwards. (\"NOLs\"), which for U.S. federal income tax purposes can be used to offset future taxable income. These NOLs are primarily related to federal NOLs we acquired through the Level 3 acquisition on November 1, 2017, and are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\"Code\") and related U.S. Treasury Department regulations. On February 13, 2019, we entered into a Section 382 rights agreement designed to safeguard our ability to use those NOLs. Assuming that we can continue using these NOLs in the amounts projected, we expect to significantly reduce our federal cash taxes for the next several years. The amounts of our near-term future tax payments will depend upon many factors, including our future earnings and tax circumstances and results of any corporate tax reform. Based on current laws and our current estimates of 2019 earnings, we estimate our cash income tax liability related to 2019 will be approximately $100 million.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to use these NOL carryforwards fully. See \"Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our November 2017 Acquisition of Level 3-We cannot assure you, whether, when or in what amounts we will be able to use Level 3's net operating loss carryforwards\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.\nDividends\nWe currently expect to continue our current practice of paying quarterly cash dividends in respect of our common stock subject to our Board of Directors' discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Following a reduction announced on February 13, 2019, our current quarterly common stock dividend rate is $0.25 per share, as approved by our Board of Directors, which we believe is a dividend rate per share which enables us to balance our multiple objectives of managing our business, investing in the business, de-leveraging our balance sheet and returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. Assuming continued payment during 2019 at this rate of $0.25 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately $274 million based on our current number of outstanding shares (assuming no increases or decreases in the number of shares, except in connection with the vesting of currently outstanding equity awards). See Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Business\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.\nRevolving Facilities and Other Debt Instruments\nTo substantially fund our acquisition of Level 3, on June 19, 2017, one of our affiliates entered into a credit agreement (the \"2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement\") providing for $10.2 billion in senior secured credit facilities, consisting of a new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility (which replaced our 2012 credit facility upon consummation of the Level 3 acquisition) and $7.9 billion of term loan facilities, of which approximately $6.0 billion were funded into escrow on such date, and $1.945 billion of which were funded upon the closing of the acquisition on November 1, 2017. On November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc., among other things, (i) assumed all rights and obligations under the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement, (ii) borrowed $400 million under the new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and (iii) received $6.0 billion of Term Loan B loan proceeds from escrow. On January 29, 2018, the 2017 CenturyLink Credit Agreement was amended to increase the borrowing capacity of the new revolving credit facility from $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion, and to increase the borrowing capacity under one of the term loan tranches by $132 million. For additional information, see (i) Note 6-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and (ii) our current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 20, 2017 and November 1, 2017.\nOn November 1, 2017, we also amended our uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility to secure the facility and to permit us to draw up to $225 million of letters of credit thereunder. At December 31, 2018, we had $97 million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility.\nFor information on the terms and conditions of other debt instruments of ours and our subsidiaries, including financial and operating covenants, see Note 6-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018: Table 222: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2024 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt(1)(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt and capital leases(2)\n</td> <td>2,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data centers obligation(3)\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Right-of-way agreements\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>755\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments(4)\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Post-retirement benefit obligation(5)\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-qualified pension obligations(5)\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total future contractual obligations (6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nTable 223: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes current maturities and capital lease obligations, but excludes unamortized discounts and premiums, net, unamortized debt issuance costs and data center obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Actual principal and interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of outstanding debt or issuance of new debt.

At December 31, 2018, the accounting unfunded status of our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans and qualified post-retirement benefit plans was $1.6 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. See Note 10-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information about our pension and post-retirement benefit arrangements.\nBenefits paid by our qualified pension plan are paid through a trust that holds all of the plan's assets. Based on current laws and circumstances, we do not expect any contributions to be required for our qualified pension plan during 2019. The amount of required contributions to our qualified pension plan in 2020 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control, including earnings on plan investments, prevailing interest rates, demographic experience, changes in plan benefits and changes in funding laws and regulations. We occasionally make voluntary contributions in addition to required contributions. We made a voluntary contribution of $500 million to the trust for our qualified pension plan during 2018. Based on current circumstances, we do not anticipate making a voluntary contribution to the trust for our qualified pension plan in 2019.\nSubstantially all of our post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded. Several trusts hold assets that have been used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees. As of December 31, 2018, assets in the post-retirement trusts had been substantially depleted and had a fair value of only $18 million (a portion of which was comprised of investments with restricted liquidity), which has significantly limited our ability to continue paying benefits from the trusts. Benefits not paid from the trusts are expected to be paid directly by us with available cash. As described further in Note 10-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, aggregate benefits paid by us under these plans (net of participant contributions and direct subsidy receipts) were $249 million, $237 million and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, while the amounts paid from the trust were $4 million, $31 million and $145 million, respectively. For additional information on our expected future benefits payments for our post-retirement benefit plans, please see Note 10-Employee Benefits to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II in this report.\nFor 2018 and 2019, our expected annual long-term rates of return were 6.5% and 4.0% for the pension plan trust assets and post-retirement plans' trust assets, respectively, based on the assets held and net of expected fees and administrative costs. However, actual returns could be substantially different.\nConnect America Fund\nAs a result of accepting CAF Phase II support payments, we must meet certain specified infrastructure buildout requirements in 33 states over the next several years. In order to meet these specified infrastructure buildout requirements, we may be obligated to make substantial capital expenditures. See \"Capital Expenditures\" above.\nFor additional information on the FCC's CAF order and the USF program, see \"Business-Regulation\" in Item 1 of Part I of this report and see \"Risk Factors-Risks Affecting Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report.\nHistorical Information\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated cash flow activities: Table 237: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(3,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,793\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>(4,023\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase /\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(730\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(8,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,877\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>5,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,874\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to $2.4 billion in cash generated by Level 3 in addition to a positive variance in net (loss) income after adjusting for non-cash items for impairment of goodwill and other assets and depreciation and deferred income taxes offset with a reduction in retirement benefits. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $730 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to a negative variance in net income adjusted for non-cash items and from negative variances in the changes in accounts payable, other current assets and liabilities, net and other noncurrent assets and liabilities, net, which were partially offset with a positive variance in the change in accounts receivable. For additional information about our operating results, see \"Results of Operations\" above.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased by $5.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in investing activities for both periods is primarily due to cash paid for the acquisition of Level 3 on November 1, 2017, which was partially offset with the cash proceeds from the May 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation business.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities increased by $9.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and decreased by $6.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in financing activities for both periods was primarily due cash received from net proceeds from issuance of new debt in 2017 relating to the acquisition of Level 3.\nSee Note 6-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, for information regarding indebtedness incurred or repaid by CenturyLink or its affiliates on our outstanding debt securities.\nOther Matters\nRecent Tax Changes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") was signed into law. The Act reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% for all corporations, effective January 1, 2018, and made certain changes to U.S. taxation of income earned by foreign subsidiaries, capital expenditures and various other items.\nAs a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, we provisionally re-measured our net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017 and recognized a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of finalizing our provisional amount recorded in 2017, we recorded a reduction to this amount of $92 million in 2018. Based on current circumstances, we do not expect to experience a material near term reduction in the amount of cash income taxes paid by us from the Act due to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. However, we anticipate that the provisions of the Act may reduce our cash income taxes in future years.\nThe Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We have completed our analysis of the impact of the one-time repatriation tax, and concluded that we do not have a tax liability under this provision.\nDuring 2018, we accelerated a significant amount of tax deductions into 2017. The accelerated tax deductions resulted in a 2017 net operating loss for tax purposes, a portion of which was carried back to 2016 to generate a cash refund of $392 million, which was received in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, we received a $314 million refund in the second quarter of 2018 related to 2017 federal income taxes.\nFor a more detailed description of the Act and its impact on us, please see Note 14-Income Taxes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nOther\nWe have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries, in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries' cash is regularly advanced to us. Although we periodically repay these advances to fund the subsidiaries' cash requirements throughout the year, at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these advances, which, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not recognized on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also are involved in various legal proceedings that could substantially impact our financial position. See Note 17-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for the current status of such legal proceedings.\nMarket Risk\nAs of December 31, 2018, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long-term debt obligations and fluctuations in certain foreign currencies. We seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates.\nManagement periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and periodically implements strategies to manage the exposure. From time to time, we have used derivative instruments to (i) lock-in or swap our exposure to changing variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or (ii) to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2018, we had no such instruments outstanding. We have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval, reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities. As of December 31, 2018, we did not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nAs further discussed in Note 6-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities, on June 19, 2017, and on November 1, 2017, we borrowed substantial sums under a credit agreement dated June 19, 2017 with various lending institutions to provide a substantial amount of the funding for the Level 3 acquisition. As further noted in Note 6-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities, loans under the term loan facilities and new revolving credit facility under the June 19, 2017 credit agreement bear interest at floating rates. Based on debt outstanding at December 31, 2018, a hypothetical increase in 100 basis points in LIBOR relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $132 million. On February 15, 2019, we executed a swap transaction that reduces our floating rate debt exposure by $2.5 billion. For additional information see Note 6-Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nWe conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported. Accordingly, our operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the U.S. dollar. Our European subsidiaries and certain Latin American subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency, as the majority of their revenue and purchases are transacted in their local currencies. Certain Latin American countries previously designated as highly inflationary economies use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Although we continue to evaluate strategies to mitigate risks related to the effect of fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we will likely recognize gains or losses from international transactions. Changes in foreign currency rates could adversely affect our operating results.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of exposures to market risks. Actual values may differ materially from those disclosed by us from time to time if market conditions vary from the assumptions used in the analyses performed. These analyses only incorporate the risk exposures that existed at December 31, 2018.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of the date of this report, we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off-balance sheet financing, liquidity, or market or credit risk support and we do not engage in leasing, hedging or other similar activities that expose us to any significant liabilities that are not (i) reflected on the face of the consolidated financial statements, (ii) disclosed in Note 17-Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, or in the Future Contractual Obligations table included in this Item 7 of Part II above, or (iii) discussed under the heading \"Market Risk\" above.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the operations and financial results of an international communications company. It highlights the acquisition of Level 3 and the subsequent impacts on the company's financial statements. It also discusses the sale of data centers and colocation business, as well as the company's segments and operating revenue.\n\nThe financial results show an increase in total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the inclusion of Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition operating revenue. The report also details various expenses, including cost of services and products, selling, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll references to \"Notes\" in this Item 7 of Part II refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Item 1 of Part I of this report for factors relating to these statements and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.\nOverview\nWe are an international facilities-based communications company engaged primarily in providing a broad array of integrated services to our residential and business customers. With approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally, we believe we are among the largest providers of communications services to domestic and global enterprise customers and the third largest wireline telecommunications company in the United States. We provide services in over 60 countries, with most of our revenue being derived in the United States.\nAt December 31, 2018, we served 4.8 million consumer broadband subscribers. Our methodology for counting consumer broadband subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies. We no longer report or discuss access lines as a key operating metric given the significant migration in our industry from legacy services to IP-enabled services.\nAcquisition of Level 3\nOn November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. (\"CenturyLink\") acquired Level 3 Communications, Inc. (\"Level 3\") through successive merger transactions, including a merger of Level 3 with and into a merger subsidiary, which survived such merger as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary under the name of Level 3 Parent, LLC.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $391 million of integration-related expenses associated with our activities related to the Level 3 acquisition. During 2018, we also recognized $2 million in merger-related transaction costs, including investment banker and legal fees.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyLink and its majority owned subsidiaries, including Level 3 beginning on November 1, 2017. Due to the significant size of the acquisition, direct comparison of our results of operations for the periods ending on or after December 31, 2017 to prior periods are less meaningful than usual.\nAs a result of the acquisition, Level 3's assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their fair value. The assignment of estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment. The use of fair value measures affects the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. We completed our final fair value determinations during the fourth quarter 2018. Our final fair value determinations were different than those preliminary values reflected in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017 and resulted in an increase in goodwill of $340 million and an increase to other noncurrent assets offset by a decrease in customer relationships during 2018.\nIn the discussion that follows, we refer to the business that we operated prior to the Level 3 acquisition as \"Legacy CenturyLink\", and we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Level 3 acquisition as \"Legacy Level 3.\"\nFor additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see (i) Note 2-Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and (ii) the documents we filed with the SEC on February 13, 2017, November 1, 2017 and January 16, 2018.\nSale of Data Centers and Colocation Business\nOn May 1, 2017, we sold our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital (\"the Purchaser\") in exchange for pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion and a minority stake in the limited partnership that owns the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company, Cyxtera Technologies. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser acquired 57 of our data centers and assumed our capital lease obligations, which amounted to $294 million on May 1, 2017, related to the divested properties.\nOur colocation business generated revenue (excluding revenue from affiliates) of $210 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, and $622 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (a small portion of which has been retained by us).\nThis transaction did not meet the accounting requirements for a sale-leaseback transaction as described in ASC 840-40, Leases - Sale-Leaseback Transaction. Under the failed-sale-leaseback accounting model, we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to the Purchaser.\nAfter factoring in the costs to sell the data centers and colocation business, excluding the impacts from the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment, the sale resulted in a $20 million gain as a result of the aggregate value of the consideration we received exceeding the carrying value of the assets sold and liabilities assumed. Based on the fair market values of the failed-sale-leaseback assets, the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment resulted in a loss of $102 million as a result of the requirement to treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation. The combined net loss of $82 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEffective with the January 1, 2019 implementation date of the new accounting standard for Leases (ASU 2016-02), this particular accounting treatment will no longer be applicable to our May 1, 2017 divestiture transaction. Consequently, the above-described real estate assets and corresponding financing obligation will be derecognized as of January 1, 2019 from our future consolidated balance sheets resulting in an increase of $115 million to stockholder's equity.\nSee Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business for additional information on the sale and Note 1- Background And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion of the impact of implementing ASU 2016-02 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nSegments\nAt December 31, 2018, we had the following two segments:\n \u2022 Business Segment. Under our business segment, we provide our products and services to large domestic and global enterprises, small and medium businesses, federal, state and local governments and wholesale customers, including other communication providers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our IP and Data Services suite of products, which includes VPN and hybrid networking, Ethernet and IP services; Transport and Infrastructure, which includes wavelengths and private line, dark fiber, colocation and data center services, and professional services; Voice Services, which includes local, long-distance, toll-free and unified communications services; and IT and Managed services, all of which are described further under \"Products and Services\"; and \n \u2022 Consumer Segment. Under our consumer segment, we provide our products and services to residential customers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our broadband, local and long-distance voice, video and other ancillary services. \nSee Note 15-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) During 2018, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.7 billion for goodwill attributed to our consumer segment. \n (2) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement resulted in tax expense of $92 million and a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (3) During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of $393 million, $271 million and $52 million, respectively. For additional information, see \"Acquisition of Level 3\" above and Note 2-Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. \nFor over a decade, we have experienced revenue declines, excluding the impact of acquisitions during the period, primarily due to declines in private line customers, switched access rates and minutes of use. To partially mitigate these revenue declines, we remain focused on efforts to, among other things:\n \u2022 promote long-term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services; \n \u2022 increase the capacity, speed and usage of our networks; \n \u2022 provide a wide array of diverse services, including enhanced or additional services that may become available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure; \n \u2022 provide our premium services to a higher percentage of our customers; \n \u2022 pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices; \n \u2022 increase prices on our products and services if and when practicable; and \n \u2022 market our products and services to new customers. \nOperating Revenue\nWe categorize our products, services and revenue among the following five categories:\n \u2022 IP and Data Services, which include primarily VPN data networks, Ethernet, IP, video (including our facilities-based video services and Vyvx broadcast services) and other ancillary services; \n \u2022 Transport and Infrastructure, which include broadband, private line (including business data services), data center facilities and services, including cloud, hosting and application management solutions, wavelength, equipment sales and professional services, network security services and other ancillary services; \n \u2022 Voice and Collaboration, which includes primarily local and long distance voice, including wholesale voice, and other ancillary services; \n \u2022 IT and Managed Services, which include information technology services and managed services, which may be purchased in conjunction with our other network services; and \n \u2022 Regulatory Revenue, which consist of (i) Universal Service Fund (\"USF\"), Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") and other support payments designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services and (ii) other operating revenue from the leasing and subleasing of space, none of which is included in our segment revenue. \nFor more detailed information, see \"Products and Services\" in Item I of this report.\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated operating revenue recorded under each of our five above described revenue categories: \n\n____________________________________________________________________  (1 ) Includes primarily VPN data network, Ethernet, IP, video and ancillary revenue. (2 ) Includes primarily broadband, private line (including business data services), colocation and data centers, wavelength and ancillary revenue. (3 ) Includes local, long-distance and other ancillary revenue. (4 ) Includes IT services and managed services revenue. (5 ) Includes CAF Phase I, CAF Phase II, federal and state USF support revenue, sublease rental income and failed-sale leaseback income. \nOur total operating revenue increased by $5.8 billion, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the inclusion of $6.7 billion in Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition operating revenue in our consolidated operating revenue. Total operating revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $935 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The Legacy CenturyLink decline in total operating revenue is primarily due to lower voice and collaboration, transport and infrastructure and IP and data services revenue. The decrease in voice and collaboration was due to continued decreases in revenue from our traditional voice telecommunications services. The decrease in transport and infrastructure reflects the decrease in volumes from our colocation business sale, reduced sales volume of private line (including business data services) services, which were partially offset with an increase in broadband and managed security services. The decrease in IP and data services was primarily due to a decrease in retail revenue, partially offset by an increase in VPN data network services.\nTotal operating revenue increased by $186 million, or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the inclusion of $1.4 billion in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 operating revenue in our 2017 consolidated operating revenue. Total operating revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decline in total operating revenue reflects the continuing loss of access lines, loss of long-distance revenue primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions in the volume of our private line (including business data services) services. Our total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 were also impacted by the May 1, 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation business, which resulted in a reduction of colocation revenue of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period.\nFurther analysis of our segment operating revenue and trends impacting our performance are provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:\n \u2022 Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers' networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as data integration and modem expenses); costs owed to universal service funds (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); and other expenses directly related to our operations; and \n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses. These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions, benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; property and other operating taxes and fees; external commissions; litigation expenses associated with general matters; bad debt expense; and other selling, general and administrative expenses. \nThese expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nThe following tables summarize our operating expenses: \n\n_______________________________________________________________________________  nm Percentages greater than 200% and comparisons between positive and negative values or to/from zero values are considered not meaningful. \nCost of Services and Products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $2.7 billion, or 32%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of $3.2 billion Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased $588 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee related expenses from lower headcount, reduced overtime, lower real estate and power expenses and a decline in content costs for Prism TV.\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $429 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of $690 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $261 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount and healthcare costs, lower real estate and power expenses from the sale of the data centers and colocation business, and reduced customer premises equipment costs due to a decrease in sales of customer premises equipment and USF rates, which were partially offset by increases in facility costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $657 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was attributable to the inclusion of $1.1 billion Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $444 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to (i) reductions in salaries and wages and employee related expenses from lower headcount, (ii) reduced overtime, professional fees, bad debt and marketing expenses and (iii) a loss on sale of data centers in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $61 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $253 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 expenses (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. Legacy CenturyLink's selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $192 million, or 6%, primarily due to (i) reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount, (ii) reduced healthcare, external commissions and bad debt expenses and (iii) losses recognized from the sale of our data centers and colocation business and the related failed-sale-leaseback as further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and increases in transaction and integration costs associated with the Level 3 acquisition.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following tables provide detail of our depreciation and amortization expense: \n\nAnnual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant (including from the acquisition of Level 3) and the divestiture of plant (including from sale of our data centers and colocation business). Depreciation expense increased by $629 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of $763 million Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition depreciation expense in our consolidated depreciation expense, which was partially offset by lower Legacy CenturyLink depreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $143 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 depreciation expense in our consolidated depreciation expense. Legacy CenturyLink's depreciation expense was lower due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant previously placed in service. Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business in late 2016. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation expense of $54 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017 related to the conveyed property. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service since January 1, 2016. As a result of not meeting sale-leaseback accounting requirements, prior to January 1, 2019 we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to Cyxtera; therefore, we are required to reflect a portion of the real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet and depreciate these assets over their useful lives. As further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business, of the $91 million increase in depreciation expense on these real estate assets, $44 million is not expected to recur in future periods.\nAmortization expense increased by $555 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $659 million and $139 million, respectively, in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 amortization expense in our consolidated amortization expense. Legacy CenturyLink's amortization expense was lower for both periods primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense each period as the intangible assets amortize. In 2017, we ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have recorded additional amortization expense of $13 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, related to the conveyed intangible assets. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nAt October 31, 2018, we estimated the fair value of our five reporting units, which we determined to be consumer, medium and small business, enterprise, international and global accounts and wholesale and indirect, by considering both a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach method includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the reporting units beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. We reconciled the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of October 31, 2018 and concluded that the indicated control premium of approximately 0.1% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place.\nAs of October 31, 2018, based on our assessment performed with respect to these reporting units as described above, we concluded that the estimated fair value of our consumer reporting unit was less than our carrying value of equity for such unit by approximately $2.7 billion. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.7 billion for goodwill assigned to our consumer segment during the fourth quarter of 2018. After the impairment charge described above, the estimated fair value of equity for our consumer segment equals the carrying value of equity for such segment.\nOther Consolidated Results\nThe following tables summarize our total other expense, net and income tax expense (benefit): \n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll references to \"Notes\" in this Item 7 of Part II refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Certain statements in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See \"Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" in Item 1 of Part I of this report for factors relating to these statements and \"Risk Factors\" in Item 1A of Part I of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects.\nOverview\nWe are an international facilities-based communications company engaged primarily in providing a broad array of integrated services to our residential and business customers. With approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally, we believe we are among the largest providers of communications services to domestic and global enterprise customers and the third largest wireline telecommunications company in the United States. We provide services in over 60 countries, with most of our revenue being derived in the United States.\nAt December 31, 2018, we served 4.8 million consumer broadband subscribers. Our methodology for counting consumer broadband subscribers may not be comparable to those of other companies. We no longer report or discuss access lines as a key operating metric given the significant migration in our industry from legacy services to IP-enabled services.\nAcquisition of Level 3\nOn November 1, 2017, CenturyLink, Inc. (\"CenturyLink\") acquired Level 3 Communications, Inc. (\"Level 3\") through successive merger transactions, including a merger of Level 3 with and into a merger subsidiary, which survived such merger as our indirect wholly-owned subsidiary under the name of Level 3 Parent, LLC.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $391 million of integration-related expenses associated with our activities related to the Level 3 acquisition. During 2018, we also recognized $2 million in merger-related transaction costs, including investment banker and legal fees.\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CenturyLink and its majority owned subsidiaries, including Level 3 beginning on November 1, 2017. Due to the significant size of the acquisition, direct comparison of our results of operations for the periods ending on or after December 31, 2017 to prior periods are less meaningful than usual.\nAs a result of the acquisition, Level 3's assets and liabilities have been revalued and recorded at their fair value. The assignment of estimated fair value requires a significant amount of judgment. The use of fair value measures affects the comparability of our post-acquisition financial information and may make it more difficult to predict earnings in future periods. We completed our final fair value determinations during the fourth quarter 2018. Our final fair value determinations were different than those preliminary values reflected in our consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2017 and resulted in an increase in goodwill of $340 million and an increase to other noncurrent assets offset by a decrease in customer relationships during 2018.\nIn the discussion that follows, we refer to the business that we operated prior to the Level 3 acquisition as \"Legacy CenturyLink\", and we refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the Level 3 acquisition as \"Legacy Level 3.\"\nFor additional information about our acquisition of Level 3, see (i) Note 2-Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and (ii) the documents we filed with the SEC on February 13, 2017, November 1, 2017 and January 16, 2018.\nSale of Data Centers and Colocation Business\nOn May 1, 2017, we sold our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners, Inc. and Medina Capital (\"the Purchaser\") in exchange for pre-tax cash proceeds of $1.8 billion and a minority stake in the limited partnership that owns the consortium's newly-formed global secure infrastructure company, Cyxtera Technologies. As part of the transaction, the Purchaser acquired 57 of our data centers and assumed our capital lease obligations, which amounted to $294 million on May 1, 2017, related to the divested properties.\nOur colocation business generated revenue (excluding revenue from affiliates) of $210 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, and $622 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 (a small portion of which has been retained by us).\nThis transaction did not meet the accounting requirements for a sale-leaseback transaction as described in ASC 840-40, Leases - Sale-Leaseback Transaction. Under the failed-sale-leaseback accounting model, we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to the Purchaser.\nAfter factoring in the costs to sell the data centers and colocation business, excluding the impacts from the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment, the sale resulted in a $20 million gain as a result of the aggregate value of the consideration we received exceeding the carrying value of the assets sold and liabilities assumed. Based on the fair market values of the failed-sale-leaseback assets, the failed-sale-leaseback accounting treatment resulted in a loss of $102 million as a result of the requirement to treat a certain amount of the pre-tax cash proceeds from the sale of the assets as though it were the result of a financing obligation. The combined net loss of $82 million is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nEffective with the January 1, 2019 implementation date of the new accounting standard for Leases (ASU 2016-02), this particular accounting treatment will no longer be applicable to our May 1, 2017 divestiture transaction. Consequently, the above-described real estate assets and corresponding financing obligation will be derecognized as of January 1, 2019 from our future consolidated balance sheets resulting in an increase of $115 million to stockholder's equity.\nSee Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business for additional information on the sale and Note 1- Background And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion of the impact of implementing ASU 2016-02 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nSegments\nAt December 31, 2018, we had the following two segments:\n \u2022 Business Segment. Under our business segment, we provide our products and services to large domestic and global enterprises, small and medium businesses, federal, state and local governments and wholesale customers, including other communication providers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our IP and Data Services suite of products, which includes VPN and hybrid networking, Ethernet and IP services; Transport and Infrastructure, which includes wavelengths and private line, dark fiber, colocation and data center services, and professional services; Voice Services, which includes local, long-distance, toll-free and unified communications services; and IT and Managed services, all of which are described further under \"Products and Services\"; and \n \u2022 Consumer Segment. Under our consumer segment, we provide our products and services to residential customers. Our products and services offered to these customers include our broadband, local and long-distance voice, video and other ancillary services. \nSee Note 15-Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Table 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018 (1)(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(2)(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions except\nper share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>22,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>2,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,313\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(849\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,733\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>626\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic (loss) earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted (loss) earnings per common share\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.63\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n (1) During 2018, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.7 billion for goodwill attributed to our consumer segment. \n (2) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%. The re-measurement resulted in tax expense of $92 million and a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 billion for 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n (3) During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we incurred acquisition-related expenses of $393 million, $271 million and $52 million, respectively. For additional information, see \"Acquisition of Level 3\" above and Note 2-Acquisition of Level 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. \nFor over a decade, we have experienced revenue declines, excluding the impact of acquisitions during the period, primarily due to declines in private line customers, switched access rates and minutes of use. To partially mitigate these revenue declines, we remain focused on efforts to, among other things:\n \u2022 promote long-term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services; \n \u2022 increase the capacity, speed and usage of our networks; \n \u2022 provide a wide array of diverse services, including enhanced or additional services that may become available in the future due to, among other things, advances in technology or improvements in our infrastructure; \n \u2022 provide our premium services to a higher percentage of our customers; \n \u2022 pursue acquisitions of additional assets if available at attractive prices; \n \u2022 increase prices on our products and services if and when practicable; and \n \u2022 market our products and services to new customers. \nOperating Revenue\nWe categorize our products, services and revenue among the following five categories:\n \u2022 IP and Data Services, which include primarily VPN data networks, Ethernet, IP, video (including our facilities-based video services and Vyvx broadcast services) and other ancillary services; \n \u2022 Transport and Infrastructure, which include broadband, private line (including business data services), data center facilities and services, including cloud, hosting and application management solutions, wavelength, equipment sales and professional services, network security services and other ancillary services; \n \u2022 Voice and Collaboration, which includes primarily local and long distance voice, including wholesale voice, and other ancillary services; \n \u2022 IT and Managed Services, which include information technology services and managed services, which may be purchased in conjunction with our other network services; and \n \u2022 Regulatory Revenue, which consist of (i) Universal Service Fund (\"USF\"), Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") and other support payments designed to reimburse us for various costs related to certain telecommunications services and (ii) other operating revenue from the leasing and subleasing of space, none of which is included in our segment revenue. \nFor more detailed information, see \"Products and Services\" in Item I of this report.\nThe following tables summarize our consolidated operating revenue recorded under each of our five above described revenue categories: Table 199: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IP and Data Services(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transport and Infrastructure(2)\n</td> <td>8,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,903\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voice and Collaboration(3)\n</td> <td>6,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT and Managed Services(4)\n</td> <td>621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Revenue(5)\n</td> <td>723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,443\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IP and Data Services(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>665\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transport and Infrastructure(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,583\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(238\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Voice and Collaboration(3)\n</td> <td>5,844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT and Managed Services(4)\n</td> <td>652\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory Revenue (5)\n</td> <td>732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________________________________________  (1 ) Includes primarily VPN data network, Ethernet, IP, video and ancillary revenue. (2 ) Includes primarily broadband, private line (including business data services), colocation and data centers, wavelength and ancillary revenue. (3 ) Includes local, long-distance and other ancillary revenue. (4 ) Includes IT services and managed services revenue. (5 ) Includes CAF Phase I, CAF Phase II, federal and state USF support revenue, sublease rental income and failed-sale leaseback income. \nOur total operating revenue increased by $5.8 billion, or 33%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the inclusion of $6.7 billion in Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition operating revenue in our consolidated operating revenue. Total operating revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $935 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The Legacy CenturyLink decline in total operating revenue is primarily due to lower voice and collaboration, transport and infrastructure and IP and data services revenue. The decrease in voice and collaboration was due to continued decreases in revenue from our traditional voice telecommunications services. The decrease in transport and infrastructure reflects the decrease in volumes from our colocation business sale, reduced sales volume of private line (including business data services) services, which were partially offset with an increase in broadband and managed security services. The decrease in IP and data services was primarily due to a decrease in retail revenue, partially offset by an increase in VPN data network services.\nTotal operating revenue increased by $186 million, or 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the inclusion of $1.4 billion in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 operating revenue in our 2017 consolidated operating revenue. Total operating revenue for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decline in total operating revenue reflects the continuing loss of access lines, loss of long-distance revenue primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services, including data and wireless communication services, and reductions in the volume of our private line (including business data services) services. Our total operating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 were also impacted by the May 1, 2017 sale of our data centers and colocation business, which resulted in a reduction of colocation revenue of $396 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior year period.\nFurther analysis of our segment operating revenue and trends impacting our performance are provided below in \"Segment Results.\"\nOperating Expenses\nOur current definitions of operating expenses are as follows:\n \u2022 Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) are expenses incurred in providing products and services to our customers. These expenses include: employee-related expenses directly attributable to operating and maintaining our network (such as salaries, wages, benefits and professional fees); facilities expenses (which include third-party telecommunications expenses we incur for using other carriers' networks to provide services to our customers); rents and utilities expenses; equipment sales expenses (such as data integration and modem expenses); costs owed to universal service funds (which are federal and state funds that are established to promote the availability of telecommunications services to all consumers at reasonable and affordable rates, among other things, and to which we are often required to contribute); and other expenses directly related to our operations; and \n \u2022 Selling, general and administrative expenses are corporate overhead and other operating expenses. These expenses include: employee-related expenses (such as salaries, wages, internal commissions, benefits and professional fees) directly attributable to selling products or services and employee-related expenses for administrative functions; marketing and advertising; property and other operating taxes and fees; external commissions; litigation expenses associated with general matters; bad debt expense; and other selling, general and administrative expenses. \nThese expense classifications may not be comparable to those of other companies.\nThe following tables summarize our operating expenses: Table 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>4,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>5,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>2,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>3,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>3,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________________________________________________________________  nm Percentages greater than 200% and comparisons between positive and negative values or to/from zero values are considered not meaningful. \nCost of Services and Products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $2.7 billion, or 32%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of $3.2 billion Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased $588 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee related expenses from lower headcount, reduced overtime, lower real estate and power expenses and a decline in content costs for Prism TV.\nCost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $429 million, or 6%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was attributable to the inclusion of $690 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization). Costs of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) for Legacy CenturyLink decreased by $261 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in cost of services and products (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) was primarily due to reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount and healthcare costs, lower real estate and power expenses from the sale of the data centers and colocation business, and reduced customer premises equipment costs due to a decrease in sales of customer premises equipment and USF rates, which were partially offset by increases in facility costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $657 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was attributable to the inclusion of $1.1 billion Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition costs (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $444 million, or 14%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to (i) reductions in salaries and wages and employee related expenses from lower headcount, (ii) reduced overtime, professional fees, bad debt and marketing expenses and (iii) a loss on sale of data centers in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $61 million, or 2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $253 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 expenses (net of intercompany eliminations) in our consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses. Legacy CenturyLink's selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $192 million, or 6%, primarily due to (i) reductions in salaries and wages and employee benefits from lower headcount, (ii) reduced healthcare, external commissions and bad debt expenses and (iii) losses recognized from the sale of our data centers and colocation business and the related failed-sale-leaseback as further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and increases in transaction and integration costs associated with the Level 3 acquisition.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe following tables provide detail of our depreciation and amortization expense: Table 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>1,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,120\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization\n</td> <td>1,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,936\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual depreciation expense is impacted by several factors, including changes in our depreciable cost basis, changes in our estimates of the remaining economic life of certain network assets, the addition of new plant (including from the acquisition of Level 3) and the divestiture of plant (including from sale of our data centers and colocation business). Depreciation expense increased by $629 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to the inclusion of $763 million Legacy Level 3 post-acquisition depreciation expense in our consolidated depreciation expense, which was partially offset by lower Legacy CenturyLink depreciation expense. Depreciation expense increased by $19 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $143 million in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 depreciation expense in our consolidated depreciation expense. Legacy CenturyLink's depreciation expense was lower due to full depreciation and retirement of certain plant previously placed in service. Additionally, we ceased depreciating property, plant and equipment assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business in late 2016. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have recorded additional depreciation expense of $54 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017 related to the conveyed property. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense attributable to new plant placed in service since January 1, 2016. As a result of not meeting sale-leaseback accounting requirements, prior to January 1, 2019 we are deemed under GAAP to still own certain real estate assets sold to Cyxtera; therefore, we are required to reflect a portion of the real estate assets on our consolidated balance sheet and depreciate these assets over their useful lives. As further described in Note 3-Sale of Data Centers and Colocation Business, of the $91 million increase in depreciation expense on these real estate assets, $44 million is not expected to recur in future periods.\nAmortization expense increased by $555 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and increased by $1 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the inclusion of $659 million and $139 million, respectively, in post-acquisition Legacy Level 3 amortization expense in our consolidated amortization expense. Legacy CenturyLink's amortization expense was lower for both periods primarily due to the use of accelerated amortization for a portion of our customer relationship assets and our entry into an agreement to sell our data centers and colocation business. The effect of using an accelerated amortization method results in an incremental decline in expense each period as the intangible assets amortize. In 2017, we ceased amortizing the intangible assets of our colocation business when we entered into the agreement to sell that business. Absent the sale, we estimate that we would have recorded additional amortization expense of $13 million from January 1, 2017 through May 1, 2017, related to the conveyed intangible assets. In addition, amortization of capitalized software was lower in both periods due to software becoming fully amortized faster than new software was acquired or developed.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nAt October 31, 2018, we estimated the fair value of our five reporting units, which we determined to be consumer, medium and small business, enterprise, international and global accounts and wholesale and indirect, by considering both a market approach and a discounted cash flow method. The market approach method includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value, which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the reporting units beyond the cash flows from the discrete projection period. We reconciled the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of October 31, 2018 and concluded that the indicated control premium of approximately 0.1% was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place.\nAs of October 31, 2018, based on our assessment performed with respect to these reporting units as described above, we concluded that the estimated fair value of our consumer reporting unit was less than our carrying value of equity for such unit by approximately $2.7 billion. As a result, we recorded a non-cash, non-tax-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $2.7 billion for goodwill assigned to our consumer segment during the fourth quarter of 2018. After the impairment charge described above, the estimated fair value of equity for our consumer segment equals the carrying value of equity for such segment.\nOther Consolidated Results\nThe following tables summarize our total other expense, net and income tax expense (benefit): Table 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,177\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,481\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,469\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(849\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>nm\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase / (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
