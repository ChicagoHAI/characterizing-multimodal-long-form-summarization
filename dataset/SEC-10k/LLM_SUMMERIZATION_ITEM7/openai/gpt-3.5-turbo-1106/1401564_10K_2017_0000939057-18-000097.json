Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K. Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this section reflects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nFirst Financial Northwest Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest and, as such, comprises substantially all of the activity for First Financial Northwest. First Financial Northwest Bank was a community-based savings bank until February 4, 2016, when the Bank converted to a Washington chartered commercial bank reflecting the commercial banking services it now provides to its customers. The Bank primarily serves King, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap counties, Washington through its full-service banking office and headquarters in Renton, Washington, as well as three retail branches in King County, Washington and five retail branches in Snohomish County, Washington. On August 25, 2017, the Bank completed the purchase of four retail branches in Woodinville in King County, and Lake Stevens, Clearview, and Smokey Point in Snohomish County and acquired $74.7 million in deposits. The Branch Acquisition expanded our retail footprint and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities. In addition, the Bank has received regulatory approval to open a new branch office at The Junction, a new, mixed use development in Bothell, Washington which is expected to open in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Bank's business consists predominantly of attracting deposits from the general public, combined with borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB\u201d) and raising funds in the wholesale market, then utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business, and consumer loans.\nOur current business strategy emphasizes commercial real estate, construction, one-to-four family residential, and multifamily lending. With the current low interest rate environment, we are not aggressively pursuing longer term assets, but rather are focused on financing shorter term loans, in particular construction/land loans. During 2017, originations of new loans and refinances outpaced repayments, resulting in net loans receivable of $988.7 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $815.0 million at December 31, 2016. Recently, improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory in certain areas in the Puget Sound region have resulted in our significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market area. We anticipate that construction/land lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction/land lending by concentrating our efforts on residential loans to builders known to us, including multifamily loans to developers with proven success in this type of construction. Originations of construction/land loans decreased to $138.6 million in 2017 from $165.4 million in 2016. These short term loans typically mature in six to eighteen months. In addition, the funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, thereby reducing our net loans receivable in the short term. At December 31, 2017, construction/land loans net of LIP was $145.6 million, a 6.4% increase from $136.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nOur primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments. Interest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently and, thus, impacts our net interest income. First Financial Northwest Bank is liability-sensitive, meaning our interest-bearing liabilities reprice at a faster rate than our interest-earning assets. Despite increasing interest rates over the last year, changes in the composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities enabled us to maintain our net interest rate spread and net interest margin at 3.47% and 3.60%, respectively, for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAn offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, or the recapture of the provision for loan losses, that is required to establish the ALLL at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our ALLL may increase, resulting in a decrease to net interest income. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in property values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any increase to ALLL due to loan growth or an increase in probable loan losses. During 2017, we had a recapture from the ALLL of $400,000 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The recapture of provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily a result of $2.3 million in net recoveries received on previously charged-off loans partially offset by the provision necessary to support the $173.6 million growth in net loans receivable. Our total adversely classified loans decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our ALLL as we deem necessary.\nNoninterest income is generated from various loan or deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d), and revenue earned on our wealth management brokerage services. This income is increased or partially offset by any net gain or loss on sales of investment securities. Our noninterest income decreased $443,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $567,000 loss on sale of investments and a $221,000 decrease in the noninterest income from our BOLI policies, partially offset by a $290,000 increase in deposit and loan related fees, and a $106,000 increase in wealth management revenue.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory assessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. OREO-related expenses consist primarily of maintenance and costs of utilities for the OREO inventory, market valuation adjustments, build-out expenses, gains and losses from OREO sales, legal fees, real estate taxes, and insurance related to the properties included in the OREO inventory. Professional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer support services, and other professional services in support of strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities. Also included in noninterest expense are changes to the Company's unfunded commitment reserve which are reflected in general and administrative expenses. This unfunded commitment reserve expense can vary significantly each quarter, based on the amount believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities, and reflects changes in the amounts that the Company has committed to fund but has not yet disbursed. Our noninterest expenses increased $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million\nincrease in salary and employee benefits expenses, a $546,000 increase in data processing expenses, a $522,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, and a $730,000 increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $8.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to $8.9 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Following the passing of the Tax Act, we elected to restructure a portion of our investment portfolio. Specifically, we sold approximately $37.0 million in securities at a loss of $670,000, which was the primary reason for the $443,000 decline in noninterest income. The investments sold were all fixed rate securities, with the proceeds reinvested primarily into adjustable rate securities. Also relating to passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a charge of $807,000 through the federal income tax provision relating to changes to our net deferred tax asset valuation as a result of the new lower enacted corporate income tax rates, which, along with higher pre-tax net income, resulted in a $1.2 million increase in the federal income tax provision. These charges, combined with a $3.9 million increase in noninterest expense reflecting the growth in our operations over the last year, which was partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in net interest income, due primarily to the increase in net loans receivable and a $400,000 recapture of provision for loan losses, were the primary factors for the decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur long-term business strategy is to operate and grow First Financial Northwest Bank as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank, offering one-to-four family residential, commercial and multifamily, construction/land, consumer and business loans along with a diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise, capital strength, and loan production capability by:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers, and delivering a consistent, high-quality level of professional service;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to diversify our deposit mix, growing lower cost deposits, attracting new customers, and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Utilizing wholesale funding sources, including but not limited to FHLB advances and acquiring deposits in the national brokered certificate of deposit market, to assist with funding needs and interest rate risk management efforts, as needed;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentration risk and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Improving profitability through disciplined pricing, expense control and balance sheet management, while continuing to provide excellent customer service.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets. The following are our critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, the current and expected economic conditions, borrower's ability to repay, the regulatory environment, competition, geographic and loan type concentrations, policy and underwriting standards, nature and volume of the loan portfolio, management's experience level, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, and the level of problem loans in assessing the ALLL. Specific allowances result when management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled. The analysis usually occurs when a loan has been classified as substandard or placed on nonaccrual status. If the market value less costs to sell ( market value\u201d) of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by establishing a specific reserve in the ALLL for the loan or by adjusting an existing reserve amount. The amount of the specific reserve is computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. In addition, specific reserves may be created upon a loan's restructuring,\nbased on a discounted cash flow analysis, comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.\nOur Board of Directors' Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends for approval the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis, and any related provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee's recommendations. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. When analysis of the loan portfolio warrants, the allowance is decreased and a recapture of provision of loan losses is included in current period earnings.\nWe believe that the ALLL is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period-to-period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of an unexpected large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, thereby reducing earnings. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio,\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nValuation of OREO. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale. Accordingly, the valuation of OREO is subject to significant external and internal judgment. If the carrying value of the loan at the date a property is transferred into OREO exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell, the excess is charged to the ALLL. Management periodically reviews OREO values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in the value of OREO are considered valuation adjustments and are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. Expenses and income from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of OREO are included in noninterest expense.\nDeferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs, and write-downs in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless.\nWhen warranted, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards. The level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management's assessment of our historic and future profitability profile. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity. For additional information regarding our deferred taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments On the Market Value of Investments. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments below their cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of such investments to their fair value. A charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made. Unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other-than-temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer. Other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of a debt security is other-than-temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies; the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position; actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security; the financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisers or market analysts. Therefore, deterioration of market conditions could result in impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio.\nFair Value. FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the\ntransaction. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value.\nDerivatives and Hedge Accounting. The Bank recognizes its interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge derivative instrument, and as such, reports the fair value as an asset or liability. Fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The derivative is marked to its fair value through other comprehensive income. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. The gain or loss on the derivative is removed from equity and recognized in noninterest income in the same period the corresponding loss or gain on the hedged cash flow is recognized in earnings.\nIntangible Assets. The Company incurred goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset through the Branch Acquisition during 2017. These assets were booked at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill will be evaluated in the future for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, with any impairment recognized as noninterest expense. The core deposit intangible is amortized into noninterest expense.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nAssets. The following table details the changes in the composition of our assets at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Balance at\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash on hand and in banks\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-earning deposits\n</td> <td>6,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,631\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments available-for-sale, at fair value\n</td> <td>132,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, net\n</td> <td>988,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>20,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB stock, at cost\n</td> <td>9,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest receivable\n</td> <td>4,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax assets, net\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO\n</td> <td>483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI\n</td> <td>29,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td>5,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposit intangible\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,210,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $172.6 million increase in total assets during 2017 was primarily a result of utilizing growth in deposits, additional advances from the FHLB, and excess cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to grow our loan portfolio by $173.6 million.\nInterest-earning deposits with banks. Our interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased by $18.6 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily to fund new loan originations during 2017.\nInvestments available-for-sale. Our investments available-for-sale increased by $3.0 million, or 2.3%, during 2017 as we continued to restructure our available-for-sale investment portfolio to transition our investment portfolio to securities with higher yields in order to enhance our interest income. Following the passing of the Tax Act, we elected to restructure a portion of our investment portfolio through the sale of certain fixed rate securities that were carried in an unrealized loss position and the purchase of primarily adjustable rate securities. During the year, we purchased $58.8 million of securities with an expected yield of 2.24%, partially funded by sales of $40.0 million with an average yield of 1.78%. The restructure discussed above resulted in an increase in the average yield of our available-for-sale investments to 2.61% in 2017 from 2.31% in 2016. Securities purchased included $15.1 million in fixed rate and $43.7 million in variable rate securities, comprised of $36.0 million in U.S. government agency bonds, $18.2 million in mortgage-backed securities, $3.0 million in corporate bonds and $1.6 million in municipal bonds.\nThe sales of investments available-for-sale generated a net loss of $567,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also received calls or partial calls and proceeds at maturity during 2017 of $731,000 of U.S. Government agency and municipal securities. In addition to the purchase and call activity, we received principal repayments of $10.7 million on our investments available-for-sale during 2017.\nThe effective duration of our portfolio decreased to 2.90% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.00% at December 31, 2016. Effective duration is a measure that attempts to quantify the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or portfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank's portfolio includes securities with embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank's investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change.\nLoans receivable. Net loans receivable increased by $173.6 million during 2017 to $988.7 million as a result of growth in all loan categories. The most significant increases occurred in multifamily loans, with a $61.7 million, or 50.0% increase and commercial real estate loans, with a $58.1 million or 19.1% increase. Commercial real estate and one-to-four family residential loans continue to be the largest concentrations in our loan portfolio at 33.0% and 25.5%, respectively, of total loans. The growth in construction/land loans was less than other loan types, with a decrease in concentration to 21.7% of our total loan portfolio in 2017 from 23.2% in 2016. During 2017, we supplemented our loan originations by purchasing $76.2 million in performing one-to-four family, multifamily, commercial, and aircraft loans from other financial institutions. The loans were purchased at an average premium of 2.3% and are intended to be held to maturity. The majority of these purchased loans are secured by properties located in states across the country, reflecting our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and credit quality objectives.\nThe quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve during 2017 as our nonperforming loans decreased to $179,000 at December 31, 2017 from $858,000 at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loans remained low at 0.02% and 0.10% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. The following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> One-to-four family residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continued to focus on reducing our nonperforming assets through loan work outs or pursuing foreclosure. Foregone interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to nonperforming loans totaled $26,000. There was no LIP related to nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016. OREO decreased to $483,000 at December 31, 2017 as we continued to sell our inventory of foreclosed real estate. During 2017, we sold three properties for $1.9 million as compared to sales of two properties for $988,000 during 2016. We did not foreclose on any properties during either 2017 or 2016. The continued decline in our nonperforming assets reflects improvements in the quality of our loan portfolio and our commitment to identify any problem loans and take prompt actions to turn nonperforming assets into performing assets.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that we use the best information available to establish the ALLL, and that the ALLL as of December 31, 2017 was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ALLL is subject\nto review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe ALLL was $12.9 million or 1.28% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 as compared to $11.0 million or 1.32% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016. The ALLL represented 7,196.7% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 compared to 1276.3% at December 31, 2016. The following table details activity and information related to the ALLL for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. All loan balances and ratios are calculated using loan balances that are net of LIP.\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At or For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Recapture of provision) provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>(400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL balance at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL as a percent of total loans, net of LIP\n</td> <td>1.28\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL as a percent of nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>7,196.65\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,276.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans\n</td> <td>0.02\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans receivable, net LIP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,002,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>828,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans originated\n</td> <td>331,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>359,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIntangible assets. As a result of our Branch Acquisition, the Bank recognized goodwill of $889,000 and a core deposit intangible ( CDI\u201d) of $1.3 million. Goodwill was calculated as the excess purchase price of the branches over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at August 25, 2017.\nThe CDI was provided by a third party valuation service and represents the fair value of the customer relationships that provide a low-cost source of funding. The analysis was performed on the acquired noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, savings, and money market accounts. The ratio of CDI to the acquired balances of core deposits was 2.23%. This amount will amortize into noninterest expense on an accelerated basis over ten years.\nDeposits. During the year ended December 31, 2017, deposits increased $122.0 million from December 31, 2016. Details of deposit balances and their concentrations are as follows:\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noninterest-bearing demand deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand\n</td> <td>38,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement savings\n</td> <td>28,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market\n</td> <td>318,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>204,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit, retail (1)\n</td> <td>333,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356,653\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit, brokered\n</td> <td>75,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total deposits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>839,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>717,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________\n(1) Retail certificates of deposit are shown net of $107,000 fair value adjustment at December 31, 2017 from acquired deposits. There is no fair value adjustment at December 31, 2016.\nThe growth in retail deposits during 2017 was primarily the result of our expansion from four branch locations to nine, with the addition of one de novo branch and acquisition of four other branches. The Branch Acquisition was executed to further shift our deposit mix by increasing core deposits and strengthen our liquidity position while providing access to contiguous markets. At the acquisition date, deposits were $74.7 million, consisting primarily of $32.7 million in money market accounts and $15.6 million in retail certificates of deposit. At December 31, 2017, we had retained 98% of the acquired deposits.\nDuring 2017, we continued the work on shifting the mix of our deposit portfolio to be less reliant on certificates of deposit, as the Bank continued to focus its efforts on growing accounts with a lower cost of funds. Our efforts resulted in money market accounts increasing $113.6 million and checking accounts increasing $31.7 million while retail certificates of deposit decreased $23.4 million during 2017. In addition, continued growth in our wealth management services provided our customers with other long-term investment choices, resulting in a decrease in deposits (primarily maturing certificates of deposit) which converted to investment accounts.\nOur portfolio of brokered certificates of deposit remained at $75.5 million at December 31, 2017, unchanged from December 31, 2016. We may add to our portfolio of these brokered deposits as a source of additional funding in future periods. While brokered certificates of deposit may carry a higher cost than our retail certificates, their remaining maturity periods of six months to 36 months, along with the enhanced call features of a majority of these deposits, assist us in our efforts to manage interest rate risk.\nAt December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we held $21.5 million and $23.7 million in public funds, respectively, nearly all of which were retail certificates of deposit. These funds were secured at December 31, 2017 with the Washington State Public Deposit Protection Commission by $14.2 million in pledged investment securities.\nAdvances. We use advances from the FHLB as an alternative funding source to manage interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet. Throughout the year, we utilized FHLB federal funds to balance our funding needs with our total funding sources. Total FHLB advances at December 31, 2017 were $216.0 million as compared to $171.5 million at December 31, 2016. During 2017, as part of our ongoing liquidity management efforts, we replaced a $20.0 million matured advance, and refinanced our existing $80.0 million member option variable-rate advance and $20.0 million of FHLB Fed Funds into a new $120.0 million three-year member option variable-rate advance that reprices quarterly and allows for prepayment without penalties on the repricing date. At December 31, 2017, we had $24.5 million in FHLB Fed Funds. Our average borrowings during 2017 were $192.2 million. At December 31, 2017, $86.0 million of our FHLB advances, including Fed Funds, were due to mature in 2018, with the remaining $130.0 million due to mature in one to three years.\nCash Flow Hedge. As part of its interest rate risk management efforts, the Bank entered into a five-year, $50 million notional, pay fixed, receive floating cash flow hedge or interest rate swap with a qualified institution on October 25, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, the Bank pays a fixed interest rate of 1.34% for five years and in return receives an interest payment based on the three-month LIBOR index, which resets quarterly. Concurrently, the Bank borrowed a $50 million fixed rate three-month FHLB advance that will be renewed quarterly at the fixed interest rate at that time. Effectiveness of the swap is evaluated quarterly with any ineffectiveness recognized as a gain or a loss on the income statement in noninterest income. A change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is recognized as an other asset or other liability on the balance sheet with the tax-effected portion of the change included in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2017, we recognized a $1.5 million fair value asset as a result of the increase in market value of the hedge agreement.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity increased $4.5 million, or 3.3% to $142.6 million at December 31, 2017 from $138.1 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in stockholders' equity was primarily a result of $8.5 million in net income partially offset by $2.8 million in shareholder dividends and the repurchase of 326,800 shares of stock at an aggregate cost of $5.3 million. In addition, the exercise of stock options and issuance of restricted stock resulted in 136,986 shares being issued from authorized shares and an increase to stockholders' equity of $1.2 million.\nThe Company has elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02 and reclassified $41,000 of stranded other comprehensive income as a result of the reduction in the tax rate in the corporate income rate from the enactment of the Tax Act from 35% to 21%. The result was a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income and an increase to retained earnings, with no net change in stockholders' equity.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in 2017 was $37.6 million, a $3.4 million or 10.0% increase from $34.2 million in 2016 due primarily to a $5.9 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $2.5 million increase in in\nterest expense. Interest income increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the growth in average loans receivable and in particular, multifamily and commercial real estate loans. In addition, the average yield of interest-earning assets increased to 4.57% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 4.39% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in average assets was funded by a $102.7 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities. The average cost of these funds increased to 1.10% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 0.92% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the overall increase in federal funds rate during 2017. Although the total yield on assets and total cost of funds increased during 2017, our net interest rate spread and net interest margin remained constant at 3.47% and 3.60% year over year. Continued growth in higher yielding loans helped contribute to maintaining these ratios.\nThe following table compares average interest-earning asset balances, associated yields, and resulting changes in interest and dividend income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in Interest and Dividend Income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Yield\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>878,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.96\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments available-for-sale\n</td> <td>134,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.61\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-earning deposits\n</td> <td>22,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB stock\n</td> <td>8,914\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest-earning assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,043,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.57\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,935\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, the $5.4 million increase in loan interest income was primarily the result of a $112.5 million increase in the average balance of net loans receivable. Also contributing to the increase in loan interest income, repayments of previously charged off notes as part of an A/B note restructure contributed $495,000 in additional loan interest income.\nInterest income from investments available-for-sale increased $450,000 during 2017 as a combined result of a $1.7 million increase in the average balance of our investments and a 30 basis point increase in the average yield to 2.61% from 2.31% during 2016. The increase in the average yield was a result of the restructuring of our investments portfolio through the sales of lower yielding investment securities and utilizing the proceeds received to purchase higher yielding, long-term investment securities.\nInterest income on interest-earning deposits remained stable with a modest $2,000 increase during the year ended December 31, 2017. Although the average balance of these funds decreased by $22.9 million as they were converted into higher-yielding assets, the increase in average yield to 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 0.52% for the year ended December 31, 2016 more than offset the decline in the average balance. The rate increase was the result of increases in the Federal Reserve's targeted federal funds rate during 2017.\nThe following table details average balances, cost of funds and the resulting increase in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nInterest\nExpense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Average\nBalance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-bearing demand accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement savings accounts\n</td> <td>28,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Money market accounts\n</td> <td>247,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>909\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit, retail\n</td> <td>345,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>335,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certificates of deposit, brokered\n</td> <td>75,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,392\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advances from the FHLB\n</td> <td>192,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>163,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest-bearing liabilities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>914,893\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>812,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.92\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $2.5 million to $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest expense during 2017 was primarily a result of the increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits of 10 basis points and the increase in the average cost of our FHLB borrowings of 44 basis points. Also contributing to a lesser extent to the increase in interest expense, the average balances of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings increased by $74.3 million and $28.3 million, respectively, in support of our asset growth.\nThe average cost of our retail deposits increased as a result of the increase in market interest rates that occurred during 2017. The average cost of brokered certificates of deposit decreased by nine basis points during 2017 as a result of the redemption of higher rate brokered certificates of deposit and subsequent replacement with lower rate brokered certificates of deposit during 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Our recapture of provision for loan losses was $400,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The recapture of provision in 2017 was primarily the result of $2.3 million in net recoveries of previously charged off loans partially reduced by the provision for loan losses required as a result of the $173.6 million increase in net loans receivable. In comparison, the provision in 2016 was primarily the result of a $130.0 million increase in net loans receivable. The quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve as indicated by our credit metrics and that the loans evaluated individually for specific reserves decreased by $13.0 million. The related specific reserves declined to $135,000 at December 31, 2017 from $309,000 at December 31, 2016.\nIn February, 2018, we received a $4.0 million payment from a borrower for the remaining balance of previously charged off loans, resulting in $3.1 million to recovery and the recognition of $914,000 of interest income. For additional information see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $443,000 to $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deposit related fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>70.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan related fees\n</td> <td>776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of investments, net\n</td> <td>(567\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,234.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI change in cash surrender value\n</td> <td>623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(221\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth management revenue\n</td> <td>919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe largest change to our noninterest income was the $567,000 loss on sales of investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a $50,000 gain on sale of investments for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a result of the\nTax Act, we opted to sell a selection of our investment securities that were in a loss position to receive the optimal tax benefit of the losses.\nOur BOLI noninterest income decreased by $221,000 during 2017 due to the $4.2 million purchase in the second quarter of new policies that offset the premium against the increase in cash surrender value for the first year. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized the net $623,000 increase in cash surrender value of these policies as noninterest income, which assists in offsetting expenses for employee benefits.\nPartially offsetting these losses, deposit related fees increased by $185,000, primarily as a result of the increase in debit card transactions reflecting the increase in the number of our accounts as well as other deposit related services at our branch locations. Loan related fees increased by $105,000 as a result of a $166,000 increase in prepayment penalties during the year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by a $40,000 reduction in loan servicing fees and a $21,000 reduction in fees from interest rate swaps from commercial loan customers during the year. Interest rate swap fees are received on loans when certain commercial loan customers participate in an interest rate swap with a third party broker institution and the Bank receives a fee that is recognized as other noninterest income at the time the loan is originated. In addition, wealth management revenue continued growing with a $106,000 increase during 2017. Since inception of our wealth management services in 2015, this line of business has grown to $44.6 million of assets under management.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $3.9 million to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>2,506\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>1,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>1,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>546\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO-related reimbursement of expenses, net\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory assessments\n</td> <td>491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance and bond premiums\n</td> <td>399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing\n</td> <td>270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>2,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, salaries and employee benefits increased by $2.4 million as compared to the previous year to $17.8 million as a result of normal wage increases and the hiring of 24 new full time positions in support of the growth in our operations, including new branches and new product lines. In addition, in response to the Tax Act, the Bank paid a special one-time bonus to all non-executive employees totaling $224,000 to share with our employees the expected future tax benefits the legislation provides.\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased $522,000 to $2.5 million during 2017 as a result of the addition of five branch locations, expenses related to our automated teller machine ( ATM\u201d) conversion and the upgrade of our main Renton branch. Lease expense increased by $165,000 and depreciation expense increased by $186,000 as we added one building, leasehold improvements and computer equipment to support the new branch operations. In support of our ATM conversion and Branch Acquisition, our data processing expense increased by $546,000 for 2017 as compared to 2016. The rate of the increase in data processing expense is expected to decline in future periods as we complete system conversion costs, although our core processor service fees will increase reflecting the expected increase in deposit accounts activity from the growth in customer accounts.\nOREO related reimbursement of expense was $67,000, a $361,000 improvement over the previous year. Valuation expense to adjust our carrying value to market value decreased by $207,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, sales of OREO properties resulted in a net gain of $110,000 in 2017 as compared to a net loss of $87,000 in 2016.\nOther general and administrative expenses increased by $730,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a $254,000 increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments due to a $20.5 million increase in our unfunded loans in process and $9.3 million increase in unfunded lines of credit. This reserve is held to absorb estimated probable losses of our unfunded lines of credit and construction loans and varies as a result of the timing of funding these loans. Other general and administrative expense increases included $103,000 for additional debit card operating expenses and $88,000 in additional deposit related expenses, both the result of increased customer volumes at our branch locations. With the addition of California loan activity and overall increase in loan income, the Bank incurred an $83,000 increase in state taxes. As a result of our Branch Acquisition, the Bank recognized CDI amortization expense of $53,000 during 2017.\nFederal Income Tax Expense. We recorded a $4.9 million federal income tax provision for 2017, compared to $3.7 million for 2016. The Tax Act resulted in a revaluation of our DTA balance at the new corporate income tax rate of 21% rather than the 35% rate previously used, effective January 1, 2018. The reduction in our DTA balance resulted in a one-time $807,000 increase in federal income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, our federal income tax expense increased due to pretax net income increasing by $817,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nAssets. The following table details the changes in the composition of our assets at December 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015.\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Balance at December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash on hand and in banks\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-earning deposits\n</td> <td>25,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,425\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments available for sale, at fair value\n</td> <td>129,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(305\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, net\n</td> <td>815,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>18,461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB stock, at cost\n</td> <td>8,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest receivable\n</td> <td>3,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax assets, net\n</td> <td>3,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,414\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(31.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d)\n</td> <td>24,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td>2,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,037,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,671\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, total assets surpassed $1.0 billion with a $57.7 million increase in total assets during the year. The increase was primarily a result of redirecting $74.4 million from lower-yielding interest-earning deposits, consisting primarily of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, to partially fund the $130.0 million growth in higher-yielding loans receivable.\nInvestments. Our investments available-for-sale remained stable during 2016 with a $305,000 or 0.2% decrease to $129.3 million at December 31, 2016 from $129.6 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, we continued to restructure our available-for-sale investment portfolio to transition our investment portfolio to securities with longer maturity periods, higher yields, and primarily fixed rates in order to enhance our interest income. During the year, we purchased $44.6 million of securities with an expected yield of 2.99%, partially funded by sales of $25.9 million with an average yield of 1.68%. Restructuring of our investment portfolio during 2016 and 2015 resulted in an increase in average yield of our available-for-sale investments to 2.31% in 2016 from 1.84% in 2015. The purchases included $31.9 million in fixed rate and $12.0 million in variable rate securities. These consisted of $28.2 million in mortgage-backed securities, $10.0 million in corporate bonds, consisting of two subordinated debt instruments issued by well capitalized financial institutions located in southern California in the amounts of $5.0 million each, $4.0 million in U.S. government agency bonds and $1.7 million in municipal bonds. The sales of investments available-for-sale generated a net gain of $50,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also received calls or partial calls of $438,000 of U.S. Government agency and municipal securities. In addition to the purchase and call activity, we received principal repayments of $15.9 million on our investments available-for-sale during the 2016.\nThe effective duration of our portfolio increased to 4.00% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 3.20% at December 31, 2015. Effective duration is a measure that attempts to quantify the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or portfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank's portfolio includes securities with embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank's investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change.\nLoans receivable. Net loans receivable increased by $129.9 million during 2016 to $815.0 million primarily due to increases of $74.8 million, or 120.5% in our net construction/land loans and $59.5 million or 24.4% in our commercial real estate loans. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $4.3 million in our one-to-four family residential loans. Commercial real estate and one-to-four family residential loans continue to be the largest concentrations in our loan portfolio at 33.7% and 27.7%, respectively, of total loans. Our construction/land loans increased to 23.2% of our total loan portfolio in 2016 from 15.5% in 2015 as we continued to originate more of these shorter term, higher yielding loans. During 2016, we supplemented our loan originations by purchasing $61.1 million in performing residential and non-residential commercial real estate and multifamily loans from other financial institutions. The loans were purchased at a 1.8% - 3.0% premium and are intended to be held to maturity. Included in these real estate loan purchases were $20.9 million of real estate loans secured by properties located in Washington. The remaining balance of $40.2 million of loan purchases were multifamily and commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon, and Utah, reflecting our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and credit quality objectives.\nThe quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve during 2016 as our nonperforming loans decreased to $858,000 at December 31, 2016 from $1.1 million at December 31, 2015. Nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loans remained low at 0.10% and 0.16% at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, decreased to $1.9 million at December 31, 2016, from $3.3 million at December 31, 2015. The following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> One-to-four family residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>996\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(198\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,332\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,748\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,559\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continued to focus on reducing our nonperforming assets through loan work outs or pursuing foreclosure. Foregone interest during the year ended December 31, 2016 relating to nonperforming loans totaled $51,000. There was no LIP related to nonperforming loans at December 31, 2016 or 2015. OREO decreased to $2.3 million at December 31, 2016 as we continued to sell our inventory of foreclosed real estate. During 2016, we sold two properties for $988,000 and had no additional foreclosures. During 2015, we sold nine properties for $6.2 million and foreclosed on one property for $141,000. The decline in both the transfer of properties into OREO and the sale of OREO properties reflects our continuing efforts to identify the problem loans within our portfolio and to take prompt appropriate actions to turn nonperforming assets into performing assets.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. The ALLL was $11.0 million or 1.32% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016 as compared to $9.5 million or 1.36% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2015. The ALLL represented 1,276.3% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2016 compared to 872.2% at December 31, 2015. The following table details activity and information related to the ALLL for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. All loan balances and ratios are calculated using loan balances that are net of LIP.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>At or For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL balance at beginning of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recapture of provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,200\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(362\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries\n</td> <td>271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL balance at end of year\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL as a percent of total loans, net of LIP\n</td> <td>1.32\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.36\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL as a percent of nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>1,276.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>872.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans as a percent of total loans\n</td> <td>0.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans receivable, net LIP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>828,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans originated\n</td> <td>359,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDeposits. During the year ended December 31, 2016, deposits increased $42.1 million to $717.5 million as compared to $675.4 million at December 31, 2015. Our retail certificates of deposit increased by $32.8 million primarily as a result of the increased customer base with our new branch locations. Retail deposits in our three new branch locations increased by $30.6 million during 2016 as a direct result of our added market presence and focus on relationship development. These efforts also resulted in a $4.0 million increase in noninterest-bearing deposits and a $2.3 million increase in interest-bearing demand deposits.\nPartially offsetting these increases, our money market accounts decreased by $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Money market accounts related to short term deposits from large construction developers that are part of the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program to fund development projects decreased to $8.5 million at December 31, 2016 from $62.8 million at December 31, 2015 as these funds were withdrawn in support of the construction projects. We do not anticipate new short term accounts of this nature to be a significant part of our retail deposits.\nBrokered certificates of deposit increased by $9.3 million during the year to $75.5 million at December 31, 2016. While brokered certificates of deposit may carry a higher cost than our retail certificates, their remaining maturity periods of 18 to 48 months, along with the enhanced call features of the majority of these deposits, assist us in our interest rate risk management efforts.\nAt December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we held $23.7 million and $16.0 million in public funds, respectively, nearly all of which were retail certificates of deposit.\nAdvances. We use advances from the FHLB as an alternative funding source to manage funding costs, reduce interest rate risk and to leverage our balance sheet. Total FHLB advances at December 31, 2016 were $171.5 million as compared to $125.5 million at December 31, 2015. During 2016, we restructured our borrowings by paying off $84.0 million of maturing advances, and adding an $80.0 million FHLB member option variable rate advance which reprices monthly and allows prepayment without penalties on the repricing dates and a $50.0 million three-month fixed rate advance entered into simultaneously with an interest rate swap for the same amount. Our average borrowings during 2016 were $163.9 million. At December 31, 2016, $70.0 million of our FHLB advances were due to mature in 2017, $21.5 million were due in one to three years and the remaining $80.0 million is due to mature in seven years.\nCash Flow Hedge. As part of its interest rate risk management efforts, the Bank entered into a five-year, $50 million notional, pay fixed, receive floating cash flow hedge or interest rate swap with a qualified institution on October 25, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, the Bank will pay a fixed interest rate of 1.34% for five years and will in return receive an interest payment based on the three-month LIBOR index, which resets quarterly. Concurrently, the Bank borrowed a $50 million fixed rate three-month FHLB advance that will be renewed quarterly at the fixed interest rate at that time. Effectiveness of the swap is evaluated quarterly with any ineffectiveness recognized as a gain or a loss on the income statement in noninterest income. A change in the fair value of the cash flow hedge is recognized as an other asset or other liability on the balance sheet with the tax-effected portion of the change included in other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2016, we recognized a $1.3 million fair value asset as a result of the increase in market value of the hedge agreement.\nStockholders' Equity. Total stockholders' equity decreased $32.5 million, or 19.1% to $138.1 million at December 31, 2016 from $170.7 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to common stock repurchases totaling $40.8 million. Partially offsetting the repurchase activity, retained earnings increased $6.1 million due to net income of $8.9 million for 2016, reduced by $2.8 million of dividends paid to shareholders. Additional paid-in-capital decreased $39.5 million due to the repurchase and retirement of 2,864,389 shares of common stock at an average price of $14.07 per share, partially offset by $621,000 of stock-based compensation expense, $297,000 from the exercise of stock options and $476,000 from the annual allocation of ESOP shares.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income in 2016 was $34.2 million, a $3.8 million or 12.3% increase from $30.4 million in 2015 due to a $4.5 million increase in interest income partially offset by a $756,000 increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily a result of a $50.5 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2016 in the average balance of our interest-earning assets, primarily due to our loan growth. In addition, as we moved funds from lower yielding interest-earning deposits to higher yielding loans receivable, we improved the total average yield on interest-earning assets by 26 basis points to 4.39% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared 4.13% for the prior year. These changes resulted in an increase to our interest rate spread of 24 basis points to 3.47% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 3.23%. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016 our net interest margin increased 22 basis points to 3.60% from 3.38% for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The increase to interest generated from this loan growth was partially offset by a decrease in the average loan yield to 4.99% from 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nInterest income from investments available-for-sale increased $812,000 during 2016 as a combined result of a $10.5 million increase in the average balance of our investments and a 47 basis point increase in the average yield to 2.31% from 1.84% a year ago. The increase in the average yield was a result of the restructuring of our investments portfolio by purchasing longer term higher-yielding investment securities to increase earnings on our investment portfolio.\nInterest income on interest-earning deposits decreased $39,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the $59.4 million decrease in the average balance of these deposits and despite the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate increases in December 2016 and 2015 which positively impacted the rate we receive on our interest-earning deposits. The average rate earned on interest-earning deposits increased 26 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the prior year.\nInterest expense increased $756,000 to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest expense during 2016 was primarily a result of the increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as we acquired funds to be used for loan growth and stock repurchases.

As a result of the early redemption of several brokered certificates of deposit and obtaining new brokered certificates at lower rates, we were able to reduce our cost of these funds by 15 basis points.\nReductions in the average cost of FHLB advances were a further benefit to our net interest margin. Although the average balance of our FHLB advances increased by $30.4 million year over year, we were able to replace maturing longer-term fixed rate advances and obtain additional advances by utilizing short-term, variable rate advances, thereby reducing the overall average cost of these funds by nine basis points. In addition, low-rate fed funds borrowing was utilized during 2016 as needed to provide the necessary funds for loan growth, then were paid off as core deposits increased.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Our provision for loan losses was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a recapture of the provision for loan losses of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The additional provision in 2016 was primarily the result of a $130.0 million increase in net loans receivable. The quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve as indicated by our credit metrics and that the loans evaluated individually for specific reserves decreased by $12.4 million. The related specific reserves declined to $309,000 at December 31, 2016 from $732,000 at December 31, 2015. In comparison, the recapture recognized in 2015 was primarily the result of recoveries of previously charged-off loans and declines in classified and special mention loans.\nNoninterest Income. Noninterest income increased $1.4 million to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service fees on deposit accounts\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan service fees\n</td> <td>445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>194.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of investments, net\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI change in cash surrender value\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth management revenue\n</td> <td>813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>344.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe largest change to our noninterest income was the $630,000 increase in wealth management revenue to $813,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $183,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in 2016 is a reflection of the full year of operations and increased investment sales commissions. The Bank began offering wealth management services during the second quarter of 2015.\nOur BOLI policies generated $844,000 of income for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of the increase in cash surrender values of these policies. The $311,000 increase from the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of holding throughout the year ended December 31, 2016, $20.0 million in additional BOLI policies purchased in April 2015. In\naddition, we replaced a $10.2 million BOLI policy with a higher yielding policy in the second quarter of 2016. We recognize the increase in cash surrender value of these policies as noninterest income, which assists in offsetting expenses for employee benefits.\nLoan service fees increased by $294,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily as a result of the growth and related activity in our loan portfolio. In addition, other noninterest income increased by $165,000 during 2016 primarily as a result of $226,000 of fees received on loans where certain commercial loan customers participate in an interest rate swap. As a result of the interest rate swap, these commercial loan customers pay a fixed interest rate to us, which we forward to a third party broker institution and receive variable interest payments based on one month LIBOR in return. On most of these loans, in addition to the interest payment, the Bank receives a fee from the counterparty that is recognized as noninterest income at the time the loan is originated. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, other noninterest income solely included a $95,000 gain on the sale of investment property.\nNoninterest Expense. Noninterest expense increased $3.0 million to $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $19.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from\nDecember 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries and employee benefits\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy and equipment\n</td> <td>1,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees\n</td> <td>1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing\n</td> <td>911\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO-related expenses, net\n</td> <td>294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Regulatory assessments\n</td> <td>420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance and bond premiums\n</td> <td>349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing\n</td> <td>194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative\n</td> <td>1,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(111\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total noninterest expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, salaries and employee benefits increased by $1.4 million as compared to the previous year to $15.4 million as a result of normal wage increases and the hiring of 14 new full time positions in support of our growth, new branches and new product lines. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $544,000 to $2.0 million during 2016 as a result of the locations of new branches.\nOREO-related expenses were $294,000, a $778,000 decline from a $484,000 reimbursement the previous year. Valuation expense to adjust our carrying value to market value increased by $216,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, sales of OREO properties resulted in a net loss of $613,000 in 2016 as compared to a net gain of $526,000 in 2015.\nOther general and administrative expenses decreased by $111,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary contributor to this decline was a recapture of $160,000 in the reserve for unfunded commitments. This reserve is funded to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities. The strong credit quality metrics of the Company's loan portfolio resulted in corresponding modifications in the unfunded commitment reserve calculation methodology, resulting in the recapture during the year. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $148,000 in additional expense representing an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments.\nFederal Income Tax Expense. We recorded a $3.7 million federal income tax provision for 2016, compared to $4.9 million for 2015, primarily as a result of the decrease in pre-tax net income. In addition, a $213,000 tax benefit was incurred for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a partial result of utilization of the capital loss carryforward on our 2015 federal tax return. The provision was based on a 35% tax rate, adjusted for permanent and temporary differences.\nAverage Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost\nThe following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as interest income from average interest-earning assets and interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spreads, net interest margins and the ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. Average balances have been calculated using the average daily balances during the period. Interest and dividends are not reported on a tax equivalent basis.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Our Board of Directors has approved an asset/liability management policy to guide management in maximizing interest rate spread by managing the differences in terms between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities while maintaining acceptable levels of liquidity, capital adequacy, interest rate risk, credit risk, and profitability. The policy established an Investment, Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d) comprised of certain members of senior management and the Board of Directors. The Committee's purpose is to communicate, coordinate and manage our asset/liability position consistent with our business plan and Board-approved policies. The ALCO meets quarterly to review various areas including:\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>economic conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest rate outlook;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>asset/liability mix;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>interest rate risk sensitivity;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>current market opportunities to promote specific products;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>historical financial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>projected financial results; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital position.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Committee also reviews current and projected liquidity needs. As part of its procedures, the Committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity, which is defined as the net present value of an institution's existing assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential change in the market value of portfolio equity that is authorized by the Board of Directors.\nOur Risk When Interest Rates Change. The rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time. Market interest rates change over time. Our loans generally have longer maturities than our deposits. Accordingly, our results of operations, like those of other financial institutions, are impacted by changes in\ninterest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. The risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk.\nWe have utilized the following strategies in our efforts to manage interest rate risk:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we are originating shorter term, higher yielding loans, whenever possible;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have attempted, where possible, to extend the maturities of our deposits which typically fund our long-term assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have invested in securities with relatively short average lives, generally less than eight years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have added adjustable-rate loans to our loan portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have added brokered certificates of deposit with a call option as a funding source; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we have utilized an interest rate swap to effectively fix the rate on $50.0 million of FHLB advances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHow We Measure the Risk of Interest Rate Changes. We monitor our interest rate sensitivity on a quarterly basis by measuring the impact of changes to net interest income in multiple rate environments. Management retains the services of a third party consultant with over 30 years of experience in asset-liability management to assist in its interest rate risk and asset-liability management. Management uses various assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of our operations to changes in interest rates. Although management believes these assumptions are reasonable, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual results differ from these assumptions. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react differently to changes in market interest rates. The interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities lag behind changes in market interest rates. Non-uniform changes and fluctuations in market interest rates across various maturities will also affect the results presented. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage loans, have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. Further, a portion of our adjustable-rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan's contractual interest rate may not adjust. Approximately 49.9% of our net loans were adjustable-rate loans at December 31, 2017. At that date, $185.4 million, or 37.1%, of these loans with a weighted-average interest rate of 4.1% were at their floor interest rate. The inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates. However, when loans are at their floors, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates. Further, in the event of a significant change in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed. Finally, the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase. We consider all these factors in monitoring our interest rate exposure.\nThe assumptions we use are based upon a combination of proprietary and market data that reflect historical results and current market conditions. These assumptions relate to interest rates, prepayments, deposit decay rates and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios. We use market data to determine prepayments and maturities of loans, investments and borrowings and use our own assumptions on deposit decay rates except for time deposits. Time deposits are modeled to reprice to market rates upon their stated maturities. We also assume that non-maturity deposits can be maintained with rate adjustments not directly proportionate to the change in market interest rates, based upon our historical deposit decay rates, which are substantially lower than market decay rates. We have demonstrated in the past that the tiering structure of our deposit accounts during changing rate environments results in relatively lower volatility and less than market rate changes in our interest expense for deposits. We tier our deposit accounts by balance and rate, whereby higher balances within an account earn higher rates of interest. Therefore, deposits that are not very rate sensitive (generally, lower balance tiers) are separated from deposits that are rate sensitive (generally, higher balance tiers). When interest rates rise, we do not have to raise interest rates proportionately on less rate sensitive accounts to retain these deposits. These assumptions are based upon our analysis of our customer base, competitive factors, and historical experience.\nOur income simulation model examines changes in net interest income in which interest rates were assumed to remain at their base level, instantaneously increase by 100, 200 and 300 basis points or decline immediately by 100 basis points. Reductions of rates by 200 and 300 basis points were not reported due to the very low rate environment.\nThe following table illustrates the estimated change in our net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2017, that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rate Simulation Impact on Net Interest Income\nfor the year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point Change in Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Interest Income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.13\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.81\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.21\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.76\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table illustrates the change in our net portfolio value ( NPV\u201d) at December 31, 2017 that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates equally across all maturities, with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basis Point\nChange in Rates (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Portfolio Value (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Portfolio as % of Portfolio Value of Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Market Value\nof Assets (6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>NPV Ratio (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change (5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,257\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(38,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.16\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.23\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,115,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127,405\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,604\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(17.27\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.22\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,141,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>142,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,838\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.99\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,172,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Base\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.83\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>158,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,225,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>No rates in the model are allowed to go below zero.

In addition, the net portfolio value is based upon the present value of discounted cash flows using our estimates of current replacement rates to discount the cash flows. The effects of changes in interest rates in the net interest income table are based upon a cash flow simulation of our existing assets and liabilities and assuming that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Delinquency rates may change when interest rates change as a result of changes in the loan portfolio mix, underwriting conditions, loan terms or changes in economic conditions that have a delayed effect on the portfolio. Even if interest rates change in the designated amounts, there can be no assurance that our assets and liabilities would perform as assumed. Also, a change in U.S. Treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the Treasury yield curve would cause changes to the net portfolio value and net interest income other than those indicated above.\nLiquidity\nWe are required to have enough cash flow in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe and sound operation. We maintain cash flows above the minimum level believed to be adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations, including potential deposit outflows. On a daily basis, we review and update cash flow projections to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained.\nOur primary sources of funds are customer deposits, scheduled loan and investment repayments, including interest payments, maturing loans and investment securities, and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with equity, are used to fund loans, acquire investment securities and other assets, and fund continuing operations. While maturities and the scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by the level of interest rates, economic conditions and competition. We believe that our current liquidity position, and our forecasted operating results are sufficient to fund all of our existing commitments.\nLiquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits or agency or mortgage-backed securities. On a longer term basis, we maintain a strategy of investing in various lending products as described in greater detail under Item 1. Business - Lending Activities.\u201d At December 31, 2017, the undisbursed portion of construction LIP totaled $92.5 million and unused lines of credit were $33.9 million. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet ongoing commitments, to pay maturing certificates of deposit and withdrawals on other deposit accounts, to fund loan commitments, and to maintain our portfolio of investment securities. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at December 31, 2017 totaled $165.9 million. Management's policy is to maintain deposit rates at levels that are competitive with other local financial institutions. In 2017, our posture was to be less aggressive in competing for certificates of deposit and public funds and focus on core deposit acquisition to reduce our cost of funds. Based on historical experience, we believe that a significant portion of maturing certificates of deposit will remain with First Financial Northwest Bank. As further funding sources, we had the ability at December 31, 2017 to borrow an additional $190.5 million from the FHLB and $35.0 million from unused lines of credit with other financial institutions to meet commitments and for liquidity purposes. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this report for further details on our cash flow activities.\nWe measure our liquidity based on our ability to fund our assets and to meet liability obligations when they come due. Liquidity (and funding) risk occurs when funds cannot be raised at reasonable prices, or in a reasonable time frame, to meet our normal or unanticipated obligations. We regularly monitor the mix between our assets and our liabilities to manage our liquidity and funding requirements.\nOur primary source of funds is our retail deposits. When retail deposits are not available to provide the funds for our assets, we use alternative funding sources. These sources include, but are not limited to, advances from the FHLB, wholesale funding, brokered deposits, federal funds purchased, and dealer repurchase agreements, as well as other short-term alternatives. We may also liquidate assets to meet our funding needs.\nOn a monthly basis, we estimate our liquidity sources and needs for the next six months. Also, we determine funding concentrations and our need for sources of funds other than deposits. This information is used by our Asset/Liability Management Committee in forecasting funding needs and investing opportunities.\nCapital\nOur total stockholders' equity was $142.6 million at December 31, 2017. Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable financial organization we will actively seek to maintain a well capitalized\u201d institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of December 31, 2017, First Financial Northwest Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Regulatory capital ratios for First Financial Northwest Bank were as follows as of December 31, 2017: Total capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.77%; Tier 1 capital and Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.52%; and Tier 1 capital to total assets was 10.20%. At December 31, 2017, First Financial Northwest Bank met the financial ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory guidelines. See Item 1. Business - How We Are Regulated - Regulation and Supervision of First Financial Northwest Bank - Capital Requirements.\u201d\nCommitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and the unused portions of lines of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Commitments to extend credit and lines of credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by us until the instrument is exercised. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had no commitments to originate loans for sale.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts\ndo not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the customer. The amount and type of collateral required varies, but may include real estate and income-producing commercial properties.\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding commitments to advance additional amounts pursuant to outstanding lines of credit, and to disburse funds related to our construction loans at December 31, 2017.\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of Commitment Expiration - Per Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total Amounts Committed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Through One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After One Through Three Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Three Through Five Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After Five Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments to originate loans\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused portion of lines of credit\n</td> <td>33,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Undisbursed portion of construction loans\n</td> <td>92,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total commitments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>62,603\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFirst Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries from time to time are involved in various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.

These principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nUnlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. The primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturity structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of noninterest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits, and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. Our management is unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the financial condition and operations of First Financial Northwest and its subsidiary, First Financial Northwest Bank.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K. Unless otherwise indicated, the financial information presented in this section reflects the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of First Financial Northwest and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nFirst Financial Northwest Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Financial Northwest and, as such, comprises substantially all of the activity for First Financial Northwest. First Financial Northwest Bank was a community-based savings bank until February 4, 2016, when the Bank converted to a Washington chartered commercial bank reflecting the commercial banking services it now provides to its customers. The Bank primarily serves King, Pierce, Snohomish and Kitsap counties, Washington through its full-service banking office and headquarters in Renton, Washington, as well as three retail branches in King County, Washington and five retail branches in Snohomish County, Washington. On August 25, 2017, the Bank completed the purchase of four retail branches in Woodinville in King County, and Lake Stevens, Clearview, and Smokey Point in Snohomish County and acquired $74.7 million in deposits. The Branch Acquisition expanded our retail footprint and provided an opportunity to extend our unique brand of community banking into those communities. In addition, the Bank has received regulatory approval to open a new branch office at The Junction, a new, mixed use development in Bothell, Washington which is expected to open in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Bank's business consists predominantly of attracting deposits from the general public, combined with borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ( FHLB\u201d) and raising funds in the wholesale market, then utilizing these funds to originate one-to-four family residential, multifamily, commercial real estate, construction/land, business, and consumer loans.\nOur current business strategy emphasizes commercial real estate, construction, one-to-four family residential, and multifamily lending. With the current low interest rate environment, we are not aggressively pursuing longer term assets, but rather are focused on financing shorter term loans, in particular construction/land loans. During 2017, originations of new loans and refinances outpaced repayments, resulting in net loans receivable of $988.7 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $815.0 million at December 31, 2016. Recently, improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory in certain areas in the Puget Sound region have resulted in our significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market area. We anticipate that construction/land lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction/land lending by concentrating our efforts on residential loans to builders known to us, including multifamily loans to developers with proven success in this type of construction. Originations of construction/land loans decreased to $138.6 million in 2017 from $165.4 million in 2016. These short term loans typically mature in six to eighteen months. In addition, the funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, thereby reducing our net loans receivable in the short term. At December 31, 2017, construction/land loans net of LIP was $145.6 million, a 6.4% increase from $136.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nOur primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments. Interest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently and, thus, impacts our net interest income. First Financial Northwest Bank is liability-sensitive, meaning our interest-bearing liabilities reprice at a faster rate than our interest-earning assets. Despite increasing interest rates over the last year, changes in the composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities enabled us to maintain our net interest rate spread and net interest margin at 3.47% and 3.60%, respectively, for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAn offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, or the recapture of the provision for loan losses, that is required to establish the ALLL at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our ALLL may increase, resulting in a decrease to net interest income. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in property values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any increase to ALLL due to loan growth or an increase in probable loan losses. During 2017, we had a recapture from the ALLL of $400,000 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The recapture of provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily a result of $2.3 million in net recoveries received on previously charged-off loans partially offset by the provision necessary to support the $173.6 million growth in net loans receivable. Our total adversely classified loans decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our ALLL as we deem necessary.\nNoninterest income is generated from various loan or deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d), and revenue earned on our wealth management brokerage services. This income is increased or partially offset by any net gain or loss on sales of investment securities. Our noninterest income decreased $443,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $567,000 loss on sale of investments and a $221,000 decrease in the noninterest income from our BOLI policies, partially offset by a $290,000 increase in deposit and loan related fees, and a $106,000 increase in wealth management revenue.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory assessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. OREO-related expenses consist primarily of maintenance and costs of utilities for the OREO inventory, market valuation adjustments, build-out expenses, gains and losses from OREO sales, legal fees, real estate taxes, and insurance related to the properties included in the OREO inventory. Professional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer support services, and other professional services in support of strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities. Also included in noninterest expense are changes to the Company's unfunded commitment reserve which are reflected in general and administrative expenses. This unfunded commitment reserve expense can vary significantly each quarter, based on the amount believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities, and reflects changes in the amounts that the Company has committed to fund but has not yet disbursed. Our noninterest expenses increased $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million\nincrease in salary and employee benefits expenses, a $546,000 increase in data processing expenses, a $522,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, and a $730,000 increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $8.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to $8.9 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Following the passing of the Tax Act, we elected to restructure a portion of our investment portfolio. Specifically, we sold approximately $37.0 million in securities at a loss of $670,000, which was the primary reason for the $443,000 decline in noninterest income. The investments sold were all fixed rate securities, with the proceeds reinvested primarily into adjustable rate securities. Also relating to passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a charge of $807,000 through the federal income tax provision relating to changes to our net deferred tax asset valuation as a result of the new lower enacted corporate income tax rates, which, along with higher pre-tax net income, resulted in a $1.2 million increase in the federal income tax provision. These charges, combined with a $3.9 million increase in noninterest expense reflecting the growth in our operations over the last year, which was partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in net interest income, due primarily to the increase in net loans receivable and a $400,000 recapture of provision for loan losses, were the primary factors for the decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur long-term business strategy is to operate and grow First Financial Northwest Bank as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank, offering one-to-four family residential, commercial and multifamily, construction/land, consumer and business loans along with a diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise, capital strength, and loan production capability by:\n \u2022 Capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers, and delivering a consistent, high-quality level of professional service; \n \u2022 Offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to diversify our deposit mix, growing lower cost deposits, attracting new customers, and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve; \n \u2022 Utilizing wholesale funding sources, including but not limited to FHLB advances and acquiring deposits in the national brokered certificate of deposit market, to assist with funding needs and interest rate risk management efforts, as needed; \n \u2022 Managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentration risk and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio; \n \u2022 Managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin; and \n \u2022 Improving profitability through disciplined pricing, expense control and balance sheet management, while continuing to provide excellent customer service. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets. The following are our critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, the current and expected economic conditions, borrower's ability to repay, the regulatory environment, competition, geographic and loan type concentrations, policy and underwriting standards, nature and volume of the loan portfolio, management's experience level, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, and the level of problem loans in assessing the ALLL. Specific allowances result when management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled. The analysis usually occurs when a loan has been classified as substandard or placed on nonaccrual status. If the market value less costs to sell ( market value\u201d) of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by establishing a specific reserve in the ALLL for the loan or by adjusting an existing reserve amount. The amount of the specific reserve is computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. In addition, specific reserves may be created upon a loan's restructuring,\nbased on a discounted cash flow analysis, comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.\nOur Board of Directors' Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends for approval the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis, and any related provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee's recommendations. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. When analysis of the loan portfolio warrants, the allowance is decreased and a recapture of provision of loan losses is included in current period earnings.\nWe believe that the ALLL is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period-to-period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of an unexpected large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, thereby reducing earnings. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio,\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nValuation of OREO. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale. Accordingly, the valuation of OREO is subject to significant external and internal judgment. If the carrying value of the loan at the date a property is transferred into OREO exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell, the excess is charged to the ALLL. Management periodically reviews OREO values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in the value of OREO are considered valuation adjustments and are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. Expenses and income from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of OREO are included in noninterest expense.\nDeferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs, and write-downs in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless.\nWhen warranted, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards. The level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management's assessment of our historic and future profitability profile. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity. For additional information regarding our deferred taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments On the Market Value of Investments. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments below their cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of such investments to their fair value. A charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made. Unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other-than-temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer. Other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of a debt security is other-than-temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies; the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position; actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security; the financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisers or market analysts. Therefore, deterioration of market conditions could result in impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio.\nFair Value. FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the\ntransaction. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value.\nDerivatives and Hedge Accounting. The Bank recognizes its interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge derivative instrument, and as such, reports the fair value as an asset or liability. Fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The derivative is marked to its fair value through other comprehensive income. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. The gain or loss on the derivative is removed from equity and recognized in noninterest income in the same period the corresponding loss or gain on the hedged cash flow is recognized in earnings.\nIntangible Assets. The Company incurred goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset through the Branch Acquisition during 2017. These assets were booked at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill will be evaluated in the future for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, with any impairment recognized as noninterest expense. The core deposit intangible is amortized into noninterest expense.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nAssets. The following table details the changes in the composition of our assets at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016.\n\nThe $172.6 million increase in total assets during 2017 was primarily a result of utilizing growth in deposits, additional advances from the FHLB, and excess cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to grow our loan portfolio by $173.6 million.\nInterest-earning deposits with banks. Our interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased by $18.6 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily to fund new loan originations during 2017.\nInvestments available-for-sale. Our investments available-for-sale increased by $3.0 million, or 2.3%, during 2017 as we continued to restructure our available-for-sale investment portfolio to transition our investment portfolio to securities with higher yields in order to enhance our interest income. Following the passing of the Tax Act, we elected to restructure a portion of our investment portfolio through the sale of certain fixed rate securities that were carried in an unrealized loss position and the purchase of primarily adjustable rate securities. During the year, we purchased $58.8 million of securities with an expected yield of 2.24%, partially funded by sales of $40.0 million with an average yield of 1.78%. The restructure discussed above resulted in an increase in the average yield of our available-for-sale investments to 2.61% in 2017 from 2.31% in 2016. Securities purchased included $15.1 million in fixed rate and $43.7 million in variable rate securities, comprised of $36.0 million in U.S. government agency bonds, $18.2 million in mortgage-backed securities, $3.0 million in corporate bonds and $1.6 million in municipal bonds.\nThe sales of investments available-for-sale generated a net loss of $567,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also received calls or partial calls and proceeds at maturity during 2017 of $731,000 of U.S. Government agency and municipal securities. In addition to the purchase and call activity, we received principal repayments of $10.7 million on our investments available-for-sale during 2017.\nThe effective duration of our portfolio decreased to 2.90% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.00% at December 31, 2016. Effective duration is a measure that attempts to quantify the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or portfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank's portfolio includes securities with embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank's investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change.\nLoans receivable. Net loans receivable increased by $173.6 million during 2017 to $988.7 million as a result of growth in all loan categories. The most significant increases occurred in multifamily loans, with a $61.7 million, or 50.0% increase and commercial real estate loans, with a $58.1 million or 19.1% increase. Commercial real estate and one-to-four family residential loans continue to be the largest concentrations in our loan portfolio at 33.0% and 25.5%, respectively, of total loans. The growth in construction/land loans was less than other loan types, with a decrease in concentration to 21.7% of our total loan portfolio in 2017 from 23.2% in 2016. During 2017, we supplemented our loan originations by purchasing $76.2 million in performing one-to-four family, multifamily, commercial, and aircraft loans from other financial institutions. The loans were purchased at an average premium of 2.3% and are intended to be held to maturity. The majority of these purchased loans are secured by properties located in states across the country, reflecting our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and credit quality objectives.\nThe quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve during 2017 as our nonperforming loans decreased to $179,000 at December 31, 2017 from $858,000 at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loans remained low at 0.02% and 0.10% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. The following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets:\n\nWe continued to focus on reducing our nonperforming assets through loan work outs or pursuing foreclosure. Foregone interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to nonperforming loans totaled $26,000. There was no LIP related to nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016. OREO decreased to $483,000 at December 31, 2017 as we continued to sell our inventory of foreclosed real estate. During 2017, we sold three properties for $1.9 million as compared to sales of two properties for $988,000 during 2016. We did not foreclose on any properties during either 2017 or 2016. The continued decline in our nonperforming assets reflects improvements in the quality of our loan portfolio and our commitment to identify any problem loans and take prompt actions to turn nonperforming assets into performing assets.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that we use the best information available to establish the ALLL, and that the ALLL as of December 31, 2017 was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ALLL is subject\nto review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe ALLL was $12.9 million or 1.28% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 as compared to $11.0 million or 1.32% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016. The ALLL represented 7,196.7% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 compared to 1276.3% at December 31, 2016. The following table details activity and information related to the ALLL for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. All loan balances and ratios are calculated using loan balances that are net of LIP.\n\nIntangible assets. As a result of our Branch Acquisition, the Bank recognized goodwill of $889,000 and a core deposit intangible ( CDI\u201d) of $1.3 million. Goodwill was calculated as the excess purchase price of the branches over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at August 25, 2017.\nThe CDI was provided by a third party valuation service and represents the fair value of the customer relationships that provide a low-cost source of funding. The analysis was performed on the acquired noninterest-bearing", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The information in this section has been derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes thereto that appear in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with these Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and the business and financial information provided in this Form 10-K.

During 2017, originations of new loans and refinances outpaced repayments, resulting in net loans receivable of $988.7 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $815.0 million at December 31, 2016. Recently, improvements in the economy, employment rates, stronger real estate prices, and a general lack of new housing inventory in certain areas in the Puget Sound region have resulted in our significantly increasing originations of construction loans for properties located in our market area. We anticipate that construction/land lending will continue to be a strong element of our total loan portfolio in future periods. We will continue to take a disciplined approach in our construction/land lending by concentrating our efforts on residential loans to builders known to us, including multifamily loans to developers with proven success in this type of construction. Originations of construction/land loans decreased to $138.6 million in 2017 from $165.4 million in 2016. These short term loans typically mature in six to eighteen months. In addition, the funding is usually not fully disbursed at origination, thereby reducing our net loans receivable in the short term. At December 31, 2017, construction/land loans net of LIP was $145.6 million, a 6.4% increase from $136.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nOur primary source of revenue is interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments. Interest expense is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Changes in levels of interest rates affect interest income and interest expense differently and, thus, impacts our net interest income. First Financial Northwest Bank is liability-sensitive, meaning our interest-bearing liabilities reprice at a faster rate than our interest-earning assets. Despite increasing interest rates over the last year, changes in the composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities enabled us to maintain our net interest rate spread and net interest margin at 3.47% and 3.60%, respectively, for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nAn offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, or the recapture of the provision for loan losses, that is required to establish the ALLL at a level that adequately provides for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As our loan portfolio increases, or due to an increase for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio, our ALLL may increase, resulting in a decrease to net interest income. Improvements in loan risk ratings, increases in property values, or receipt of recoveries of amounts previously charged off may partially or fully offset any increase to ALLL due to loan growth or an increase in probable loan losses. During 2017, we had a recapture from the ALLL of $400,000 as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The recapture of provision for loan losses in 2017 was primarily a result of $2.3 million in net recoveries received on previously charged-off loans partially offset by the provision necessary to support the $173.6 million growth in net loans receivable. Our total adversely classified loans decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. We will continue to monitor our loan portfolio and make adjustments to our ALLL as we deem necessary.\nNoninterest income is generated from various loan or deposit fees, increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance ( BOLI\u201d), and revenue earned on our wealth management brokerage services. This income is increased or partially offset by any net gain or loss on sales of investment securities. Our noninterest income decreased $443,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $567,000 loss on sale of investments and a $221,000 decrease in the noninterest income from our BOLI policies, partially offset by a $290,000 increase in deposit and loan related fees, and a $106,000 increase in wealth management revenue.\nOur noninterest expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, professional fees, regulatory assessments, occupancy and equipment, and other general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement, and other employee benefits. OREO-related expenses consist primarily of maintenance and costs of utilities for the OREO inventory, market valuation adjustments, build-out expenses, gains and losses from OREO sales, legal fees, real estate taxes, and insurance related to the properties included in the OREO inventory. Professional fees include legal services, auditing and accounting services, computer support services, and other professional services in support of strategic plans. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment, consist primarily of real estate taxes, depreciation expenses, maintenance, and costs of utilities. Also included in noninterest expense are changes to the Company's unfunded commitment reserve which are reflected in general and administrative expenses. This unfunded commitment reserve expense can vary significantly each quarter, based on the amount believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities, and reflects changes in the amounts that the Company has committed to fund but has not yet disbursed. Our noninterest expenses increased $3.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million\nincrease in salary and employee benefits expenses, a $546,000 increase in data processing expenses, a $522,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expenses, and a $730,000 increase in other general and administrative expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $8.5 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, compared to $8.9 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Following the passing of the Tax Act, we elected to restructure a portion of our investment portfolio. Specifically, we sold approximately $37.0 million in securities at a loss of $670,000, which was the primary reason for the $443,000 decline in noninterest income. The investments sold were all fixed rate securities, with the proceeds reinvested primarily into adjustable rate securities. Also relating to passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a charge of $807,000 through the federal income tax provision relating to changes to our net deferred tax asset valuation as a result of the new lower enacted corporate income tax rates, which, along with higher pre-tax net income, resulted in a $1.2 million increase in the federal income tax provision. These charges, combined with a $3.9 million increase in noninterest expense reflecting the growth in our operations over the last year, which was partially offset by a $3.4 million increase in net interest income, due primarily to the increase in net loans receivable and a $400,000 recapture of provision for loan losses, were the primary factors for the decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur long-term business strategy is to operate and grow First Financial Northwest Bank as a well-capitalized and profitable community bank, offering one-to-four family residential, commercial and multifamily, construction/land, consumer and business loans along with a diversified array of deposit and other products and services to individuals and businesses in our market areas. We intend to accomplish this strategy by leveraging our established name and franchise, capital strength, and loan production capability by:\n \u2022 Capitalizing on our intimate knowledge of our local communities to serve the convenience and needs of customers, and delivering a consistent, high-quality level of professional service; \n \u2022 Offering competitive deposit rates and developing customer relationships to diversify our deposit mix, growing lower cost deposits, attracting new customers, and expanding our footprint in the geographical area we serve; \n \u2022 Utilizing wholesale funding sources, including but not limited to FHLB advances and acquiring deposits in the national brokered certificate of deposit market, to assist with funding needs and interest rate risk management efforts, as needed; \n \u2022 Managing our loan portfolio to minimize concentration risk and diversify the types of loans within the portfolio; \n \u2022 Managing credit risk to minimize the risk of loss and interest rate risk to optimize our net interest margin; and \n \u2022 Improving profitability through disciplined pricing, expense control and balance sheet management, while continuing to provide excellent customer service. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have, or could have, a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets. The following are our critical accounting policies.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. Management recognizes that loan losses may occur over the life of a loan and that the ALLL must be maintained at a level necessary to absorb specific losses on impaired loans and probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Our methodology for analyzing the ALLL consists of two components: general and specific allowances. The general allowance is determined by applying factors to our various groups of loans. Management considers factors such as charge-off history, the current and expected economic conditions, borrower's ability to repay, the regulatory environment, competition, geographic and loan type concentrations, policy and underwriting standards, nature and volume of the loan portfolio, management's experience level, our loan review and grading systems, the value of underlying collateral, and the level of problem loans in assessing the ALLL. Specific allowances result when management performs an impairment analysis on a loan when it determines it is probable that all contractual amounts of principal and interest will not be paid as scheduled. The analysis usually occurs when a loan has been classified as substandard or placed on nonaccrual status. If the market value less costs to sell ( market value\u201d) of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized by establishing a specific reserve in the ALLL for the loan or by adjusting an existing reserve amount. The amount of the specific reserve is computed using current appraisals, listed sales prices, and other available information less costs to complete, if any, and costs to sell the property. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events differ from predictions. In addition, specific reserves may be created upon a loan's restructuring,\nbased on a discounted cash flow analysis, comparing the present value of the anticipated repayments under the restructured terms to the outstanding principal balance of the loan.\nOur Board of Directors' Internal Asset Review Committee reviews and recommends for approval the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis, and any related provision or recapture of provision for loan losses, and the full Board of Directors approves the provision or recapture after considering the Committee's recommendations. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period earnings. When analysis of the loan portfolio warrants, the allowance is decreased and a recapture of provision of loan losses is included in current period earnings.\nWe believe that the ALLL is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period-to-period requiring management to make assumptions about probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The impact of an unexpected large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance, thereby reducing earnings. For additional information see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio,\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nValuation of OREO. Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Fair value is generally determined by management based on a number of factors, including third-party appraisals of fair value in an orderly sale. Accordingly, the valuation of OREO is subject to significant external and internal judgment. If the carrying value of the loan at the date a property is transferred into OREO exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell, the excess is charged to the ALLL. Management periodically reviews OREO values to determine whether the property continues to be carried at the lower of its recorded book value or fair value, net of estimated costs to sell. Any further decreases in the value of OREO are considered valuation adjustments and are charged to noninterest expense in the Consolidated Income Statements. Expenses and income from the maintenance and operations and any gains or losses from the sales of OREO are included in noninterest expense.\nDeferred Taxes. Deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being expenses recognized in our financial statements but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs, and write-downs in the value of assets for financial statement purposes that are not deductible for tax purposes until the asset is sold or deemed worthless.\nWhen warranted, we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that can be recognized in line with the relevant accounting standards. The level of deferred tax asset recognition is influenced by management's assessment of our historic and future profitability profile. At each balance sheet date, existing assessments are reviewed and, if necessary, revised to reflect changed circumstances. In a situation where income is less than projected or recent losses have been incurred, the relevant accounting standards require convincing evidence that there will be sufficient future tax capacity. For additional information regarding our deferred taxes, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairments On the Market Value of Investments. Declines in the fair value of available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments below their cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in a reduction in the carrying amount of such investments to their fair value. A charge to earnings and an establishment of a new cost basis for the investment is made. Unrealized investment losses are evaluated at least quarterly to determine whether such declines should be considered other-than-temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition. Although these evaluations involve significant judgment, an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the investment security is below the carrying value primarily due to changes in interest rates and there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer. Other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of a debt security is other-than-temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies; the extent and duration of an unrealized loss position; actions of commercial banks or other lenders relative to the continued extension of credit facilities to the issuer of the security; the financial condition, capital strength and near-term prospects of the issuer and recommendations of investment advisers or market analysts. Therefore, deterioration of market conditions could result in impairment losses recognized within the investment portfolio.\nFair Value. FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value. Pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the\ntransaction. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional information about the level of pricing transparency associated with financial instruments carried at fair value.\nDerivatives and Hedge Accounting. The Bank recognizes its interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge derivative instrument, and as such, reports the fair value as an asset or liability. Fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. The derivative is marked to its fair value through other comprehensive income. Any ineffectiveness is recognized in earnings. The gain or loss on the derivative is removed from equity and recognized in noninterest income in the same period the corresponding loss or gain on the hedged cash flow is recognized in earnings.\nIntangible Assets. The Company incurred goodwill and a core deposit intangible asset through the Branch Acquisition during 2017. These assets were booked at fair value at the time of the acquisition. Goodwill will be evaluated in the future for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, with any impairment recognized as noninterest expense. The core deposit intangible is amortized into noninterest expense.\nComparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nAssets. The following table details the changes in the composition of our assets at December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Balance at\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change from December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash on hand and in banks\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest-earning deposits\n</td> <td>6,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,631\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(72.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments available-for-sale, at fair value\n</td> <td>132,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans receivable, net\n</td> <td>988,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premises and equipment, net\n</td> <td>20,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FHLB stock, at cost\n</td> <td>9,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,851\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accrued interest receivable\n</td> <td>4,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred tax assets, net\n</td> <td>1,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO\n</td> <td>483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BOLI\n</td> <td>29,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prepaid expenses and other assets\n</td> <td>5,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core deposit intangible\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,210,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>172,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $172.6 million increase in total assets during 2017 was primarily a result of utilizing growth in deposits, additional advances from the FHLB, and excess cash held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to grow our loan portfolio by $173.6 million.\nInterest-earning deposits with banks. Our interest-earning deposits with banks, consisting primarily of funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased by $18.6 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 primarily to fund new loan originations during 2017.\nInvestments available-for-sale. Our investments available-for-sale increased by $3.0 million, or 2.3%, during 2017 as we continued to restructure our available-for-sale investment portfolio to transition our investment portfolio to securities with higher yields in order to enhance our interest income. Following the passing of the Tax Act, we elected to restructure a portion of our investment portfolio through the sale of certain fixed rate securities that were carried in an unrealized loss position and the purchase of primarily adjustable rate securities. During the year, we purchased $58.8 million of securities with an expected yield of 2.24%, partially funded by sales of $40.0 million with an average yield of 1.78%. The restructure discussed above resulted in an increase in the average yield of our available-for-sale investments to 2.61% in 2017 from 2.31% in 2016. Securities purchased included $15.1 million in fixed rate and $43.7 million in variable rate securities, comprised of $36.0 million in U.S. government agency bonds, $18.2 million in mortgage-backed securities, $3.0 million in corporate bonds and $1.6 million in municipal bonds.\nThe sales of investments available-for-sale generated a net loss of $567,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also received calls or partial calls and proceeds at maturity during 2017 of $731,000 of U.S. Government agency and municipal securities. In addition to the purchase and call activity, we received principal repayments of $10.7 million on our investments available-for-sale during 2017.\nThe effective duration of our portfolio decreased to 2.90% at December 31, 2017 as compared to 4.00% at December 31, 2016. Effective duration is a measure that attempts to quantify the anticipated percentage change in the value of an investment (or portfolio) in the event of a 100 basis point change in market yields. Since the Bank's portfolio includes securities with embedded options (including call options on bonds and prepayment options on mortgage-backed securities), management believes that effective duration is an appropriate metric to use as a tool when analyzing the Bank's investment securities portfolio, as effective duration incorporates assumptions relating to such embedded options, including changes in cash flow assumptions as interest rates change.\nLoans receivable. Net loans receivable increased by $173.6 million during 2017 to $988.7 million as a result of growth in all loan categories. The most significant increases occurred in multifamily loans, with a $61.7 million, or 50.0% increase and commercial real estate loans, with a $58.1 million or 19.1% increase. Commercial real estate and one-to-four family residential loans continue to be the largest concentrations in our loan portfolio at 33.0% and 25.5%, respectively, of total loans. The growth in construction/land loans was less than other loan types, with a decrease in concentration to 21.7% of our total loan portfolio in 2017 from 23.2% in 2016. During 2017, we supplemented our loan originations by purchasing $76.2 million in performing one-to-four family, multifamily, commercial, and aircraft loans from other financial institutions. The loans were purchased at an average premium of 2.3% and are intended to be held to maturity. The majority of these purchased loans are secured by properties located in states across the country, reflecting our efforts to geographically diversify our loan portfolio with loans meeting our investment and credit quality objectives.\nThe quality of our loan portfolio continued to improve during 2017 as our nonperforming loans decreased to $179,000 at December 31, 2017 from $858,000 at December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans as a percent of our total loans remained low at 0.02% and 0.10% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adversely classified loans, defined as substandard or below, decreased to $1.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $1.9 million at December 31, 2016. The following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount of\nChange\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent of\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonperforming loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> One-to-four family residential\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>128\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Consumer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(679\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,848\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total nonperforming assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(79.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continued to focus on reducing our nonperforming assets through loan work outs or pursuing foreclosure. Foregone interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 relating to nonperforming loans totaled $26,000. There was no LIP related to nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 or 2016. OREO decreased to $483,000 at December 31, 2017 as we continued to sell our inventory of foreclosed real estate. During 2017, we sold three properties for $1.9 million as compared to sales of two properties for $988,000 during 2016. We did not foreclose on any properties during either 2017 or 2016. The continued decline in our nonperforming assets reflects improvements in the quality of our loan portfolio and our commitment to identify any problem loans and take prompt actions to turn nonperforming assets into performing assets.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses. We believe that we use the best information available to establish the ALLL, and that the ALLL as of December 31, 2017 was adequate to absorb the probable and inherent losses in the loan portfolio at that date. While we believe the estimates and assumptions used in our determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions, or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Future additions to the allowance may become necessary based upon changing economic conditions, the level of problem loans, business conditions, credit concentrations, increased loan balances, or changes in the underlying collateral of the loan portfolio. In addition, the determination of the amount of our ALLL is subject\nto review by bank regulators as part of the routine examination process that which may result in the establishment of additional loss reserves or the charge-off of specific loans against established loss reserves based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe ALLL was $12.9 million or 1.28% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 as compared to $11.0 million or 1.32% of total loans outstanding at December 31, 2016.
