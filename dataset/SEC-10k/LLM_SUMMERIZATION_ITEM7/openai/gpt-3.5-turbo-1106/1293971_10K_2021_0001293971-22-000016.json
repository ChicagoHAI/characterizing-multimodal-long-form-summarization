Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform. Our gene therapy programs in severe genetic diseases include programs for \u03b2-thalassemia, SCD, and CALD. We also expect to make focused investments in research and development efforts on optimizing our existing programs as well as on pipeline programs in severe genetic diseases. The BLA for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with \u03b2-thalassemia who receive regular RBC transfusions was accepted for priority review by the FDA, and the PDUFA goal date is August 19, 2022. The BLA for eli-cel as a treatment for patients less than 18 years of age with early CALD was accepted for priority review by the FDA, and the PDUFA goal date is September 16, 2022. We are developing lovo-cel as a treatment for patients with SCD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for lovo-cel in the United States on the basis of clinical data from HGB-206 Group C, with supporting data from HGB-210. We have treated all of the patients who will form the primary basis of efficacy for approval, with the demonstration of analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process as the key remaining actions prior to submission of our planned BLA for lovo-cel. In December 2021, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our clinical program for lovo-cel for enrolling patients under the age of 18. During the partial clinical hold, we anticipate continuing our clinical study activities as planned for patients 18 and older in HGB-210, as well as follow-up activities for treated patients of all ages in all studies.\nWe are focusing our development and commercialization efforts in the U.S. market. We have submitted a request for the withdrawal of the marketing authorization for beti-cel in the European Union, to be effective in the first half of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have withdrawn the marketing authorization for eli-cel in the European Union. We are continuing the long-term follow-up of patients previously enrolled within the clinical trial programs in Europe as planned but do not intend to initiate any new clinical trials in Europe for \u03b2-thalassemia, CALD or SCD. As a result, we anticipate a reduction of selling, general and administrative costs and an impact on our excess inventory analysis as future lots are produced, which is based on forecasted consumption levels driven by sales forecasts.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including activities to manufacture product candidates in compliance with good manufacturing practices (\"GMP\") to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, to provide selling, general and administrative support for these operations and to protect our intellectual property. We have not generated material revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock in our public offerings, private placements of preferred stock and warrants and through collaborations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net loss from continuing operations was $562.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our accumulated deficit was $3.72 billion as of December 31, 2021. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years, as we:\n\u2022fund activities related to the potential commercial launches of our late-stage product candidates in the United States;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022scale our manufacturing capabilities in support of potential commercialization following any regulatory approvals;\n\u2022conduct clinical studies for our clinical programs in \u03b2-thalassemia and SCD, and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development; and\n\u2022increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates and technologies in severe genetic diseases.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nBusiness update\nWe continue to experience disruptions and increased risk related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the timing of patient treatment in Europe in the commercial context, and the timing of our ongoing clinical studies, with the result of slower patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical studies and delays in post-treatment follow up visits, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and by program. It has also affected our activities with and operations at our third-party manufacturers. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. As a result of the demands upon healthcare regulatory authorities, review, inspection, and other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development may be impacted, and may result in delays for an unknown period of time.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory, and a flexible work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel.\nWe are working with our clinical study sites to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on activities for our ongoing clinical studies. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict.\nIn March 2021, we placed a portion of our internal LVV manufacturing facility into service, while still completing qualification of the remaining portion. In September 2021, we completed the sale of this LVV manufacturing facility to National Resilience, Inc. Currently all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties and we utilize third-party contract research organizations (\"CROs\") to carry out our clinical development activities. As we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin commercialization following marketing approval, if obtained, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution at such time. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales at such time, we will continue to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.\nIn April 2021, we announced our decision to withdraw ZYNTEGLO from the German market because reimbursement negotiations in Germany did not result in a price for ZYNTEGLO that reflects the value of the one-time gene therapy with potential life-long benefit for people living with transfusion dependent \u03b2-thalassemia. A total of approximately 50 employees were impacted by this reduction. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we substantially completed the implementation of this reduction and, in accordance with ASC 420, Exit and Disposal Activities, and ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment\nBenefits, recorded approximately $4.6 million of costs including severance, the portion of the employees' 2021 retention bonuses to be paid in cash, and the pro rata portion of the employees' 2021 performance bonus.\nIn July 2021, we made the decision to focus our efforts on the U.S. market for beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel and are executing an orderly wind down of our European operations. A total of approximately 90 employees were impacted by the reduction in workforce associated with this decision. We recorded $21.2 million of expense, in accordance with the related accounting standards mentioned above, for the affected employees.\nAll costs associated with the April 2021 and July 2021 reductions are reflected within restructuring expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 17, Reduction in Workforce, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million as of December 31, 2021. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 205-40, Going Concern, we evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of our plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In performing this analysis, we excluded certain elements of our operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future equity or debt issuances, the release of restricted cash related to the Company's 50 Binney Street sublease, and the potential sale of priority review vouchers, if received, cannot be considered probable at this time because none of the plans are entirely within the Company's control or have been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of the financial statements.\nOur expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our plan to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced 2022 spending, including projected savings through the move of the Company's headquarters to Assembly Row in Somerville, Massachusetts, the orderly wind down of European operations, the potential sale of priority review vouchers that would be issued with anticipated U.S. regulatory approvals of BLAs for beti-cel and eli-cel, and the pursuit of additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. We have concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nOur legacy business\nOn November 4, 2021, we completed the separation of our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, publicly traded companies: bluebird bio, Inc. and 2seventy bio, Inc. (\"2seventy bio\"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary prior to the separation (the \"Separation\"). The Separation was effected by means of a distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of 2seventy bio in which each bluebird stockholder received one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of 2seventy bio for every three shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of bluebird held as of the close of business on October 19, 2021 (the \"Distribution\").\nWe intend to focus on our severe genetic disease programs and 2seventy bio is expected to focus on the separated oncology programs. In collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (\"BMS\"), 2seventy bio is commercializing idecabtagene vicleucel (\"ide-cel\") and developing bb21217 as treatments for multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy that develops in the bone marrow and is fatal if untreated. 2seventy bio is co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel as ABECMA in the United States with BMS and has exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. It\nhas exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for 2seventy bio to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In March 2021, BMS received marketing approval from the FDA for ide-cel, marketed as ABECMA, as a treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Sales of ABECMA by BMS began in the second quarter of 2021.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a separation agreement with 2seventy bio, dated as of November 3, 2021, that, among other things, sets forth our agreements with 2seventy bio regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Separation, including the Distribution. In connection with the Separation, we also entered into certain other agreements with 2seventy bio, including transition services agreements. Pursuant to the transition services agreements, we are obligated to provide and are entitled to receive certain transition services related to corporate functions, such as finance, human resources, internal audit, research and development, financial reporting, and information technology. The separation and the aforementioned agreements are more fully described in Note 3, Discontinued operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial operations overview\nProduct revenue\nOur revenues have primarily been derived from product revenues associated with the sale of ZYNTEGLO in Germany.\nOther revenue\nWe have recognized an immaterial amount of revenue associated with grants and collaboration agreements.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;\n\u2022reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;\n\u2022costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;\n\u2022milestones and upfront license payments;\n\u2022costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangible assets.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates, including:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;\n\u2022future clinical study results;\n\u2022uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our LVV or drug product;\n\u2022regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and\n\u2022the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel, and conduct research and development activities in our pipeline programs. Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:\n\u2022for the clinical studies of beti-cel, consisting of HGB-207, HGB-212, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022for the clinical studies of lovo-cel, consisting of HGB-206, HGB-210, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022for the clinical studies of eli-cel, consisting of ALD-104, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022research and development activities for platform technology and our preclinical pipeline programs; and\n\u2022for the manufacture of clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.\nWe expect that the timing of investment in our ongoing clinical studies will reflect COVID-19 related delays in these studies.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below: Table 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>beti-cel </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,896 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>lovo-cel (formerly LentiGlobin for SCD)\n</td> <td>64,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>eli-cel </td> <td>54,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,352 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical programs </td> <td>7,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total direct research and development expense </td> <td>179,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee- and contractor-related expenses </td> <td>48,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,619 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>42,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Laboratory and related expenses(1)\n</td> <td>5,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other collaboration expenses(1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility expenses </td> <td>41,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other research and development expenses </td> <td>139,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,880 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Prior to 2020, costs within these categories were disclosed as \"platform-related expenses.\"\n(2)Prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Separation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors' fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and sales and marketing expenses, will continue to increase in the future relative to current levels as we perform commercial readiness activities in the United States for our product candidates.\nCost of product revenue\nCost of product revenue includes costs associated with the sale of ZYNTEGLO in Germany.\nRestructuring expenses\nWe record costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit and Disposal Cost Obligations, and other costs and liabilities associated with postemployment nonretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 712, Postemployment Nonretirement Benefits. Such costs are based on the estimate of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred. We evaluate and adjust costs as appropriate for changes in circumstances as additional information becomes available.\nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of gains and losses on equity securities held by us, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nDiscontinued operations\nNet loss from discontinued operations consists of the results of our oncology business and our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina and is reported as a separate component of income.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nDiscontinued operations\nWe determined that the Separation of our oncology business on November 4, 2021 and the sale of our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina in July 2021 represented multiple components of a single disposal plan that met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-20, Discontinued Operations. Accordingly,\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods have been updated to present the assets and liabilities associated with the oncology business and the manufacturing facility separately as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet and the results of all discontinued operations reported as a separate component of income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFor additional information related to discontinued operations, refer to Note 3, Discontinued operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue recognition\nUnder Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d) on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIf an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.\nProduct revenue\nWe recognize product revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Product revenue represents sales of ZYNTEGLO. In 2021, we distributed ZYNTEGLO directly to hospitals in Germany. We determined that our contracted sales with hospitals formed a single performance obligation and we recognize revenue from product sales at the point in time that we satisfy our performance obligation, which is upon transferring control of ZYNTEGLO to the hospital. Control of the product generally transfers upon infusion of the product. Costs to manufacture and deliver the product and those associated with administering the therapy are included in cost of product revenue.\nLeases\nUnder ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d), at the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. We do not have material financing leases.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. To estimate our incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to us is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since we do not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating. Prospectively, we will adjust the right-of-use assets for straight-line rent expense or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date.\nWe have elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. We typically only include an initial lease term in our assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in our assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that we will renew.\nAssumptions that we made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, non-lease components, and non-components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any consideration related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components.\nEntities may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components. Rather, entities would account for each lease component and related non-lease component together as a single lease component. We have elected to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component for all underlying assets and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only.\nASC 842 allows for the use of judgment in determining whether the assumed lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset and whether the present value of lease payments represents substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. We apply the bright line thresholds referenced in ASC 842-10-55-2 to assist in evaluating leases for appropriate classification. The aforementioned bright lines are applied consistently to our entire portfolio of leases.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.\nWe recognize expenses related to clinical studies based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.\nOther examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n\u2022vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to the development, manufacturing, and distribution of clinical trial materials.\nStock-based compensation\nWe issue stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units. We account for our stock-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (\"ASC 718\"). ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), the measurement date for non-employee awards was generally the date the services are completed, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant without changes in the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation costs for non-employees are recognized as expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and non-employees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable. We estimate the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and do not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of our stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. Effective January 1, 2020, we eliminated the use of a representative peer group and use only our own historical volatility data in our estimate of expected volatility given that there is now a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option, unless there are more appropriate indicators of the expected life when measuring the fair value of a modified award. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted.\nConversion and modification of equity awards outstanding at Separation date\nIn connection with the Separation on November 4, 2021, under the provisions of the existing plans, we adjusted our outstanding equity awards in accordance with the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement (an equitable adjustment) to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately before and after the Distribution. Upon the Distribution, employees holding stock options, restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units denominated in pre-Distribution bluebird stock received a number of otherwise-similar awards either in post-Distribution bluebird stock or in a combination of post-Distribution bluebird stock and 2seventy bio stock based on conversion ratios outlined for each group of employees in the Employee Matters Agreement that we entered into in connection with the Distribution. The equity awards that were granted prior to 2021 were converted under the shareholder method, wherein employees holding outstanding equity awards received\nequity awards in both bluebird and 2seventy bio. The conversion ratio for the shareholder method took into consideration a distribution ratio of one share of 2seventy bio common stock for every three shares of bluebird common stock. For equity awards granted in 2021, the number of awards that were outstanding at the Separation were proportionately adjusted to maintain the aggregate intrinsic value of the awards at the date of the Separation. The conversion ratio was determined based on the volume weighted-average trading price for bluebird common stock for the five trading days before and after the Separation.\nThese modified awards otherwise retained substantially the same terms and conditions, including term and vesting provisions. Additionally, we will not incur any future compensation cost related to equity awards held by 2seventy bio employees and directors. We will incur future compensation cost related to 2seventy bio equity awards held by our employees.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Table 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,850 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>812 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>3,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,662 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>319,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>319,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>637 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>209,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29,981) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue </td> <td>38,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,857 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring expense </td> <td>25,801 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,801 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>594,573 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>559,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,314 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(590,911) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(559,259) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31,652) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net </td> <td>879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,891) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td>27,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,881) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,533 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(562,380) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(560,370) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,010) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit </td> <td>(258) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(686) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>428 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from continuing operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(562,638) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(561,056) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,582) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(256,740) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(57,639) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(199,101) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(819,378) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(618,695) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(200,683) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and is comprised primarily of product revenue from sales of ZYNTEGLO in Germany. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we had no sales of ZYNTEGLO as we had not yet obtained pricing approval in Germany.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $319.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase of $0.6 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$13.1 million of increased information technology and facility-related costs;\n\u2022$4.8 million of increased material production fees; and\n\u2022$2.1 million of increased value-added taxes.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$5.5 million of decreased clinical trial costs primarily driven by the clinical hold from February 2021 to June 2021 on our studies of lovo-cel;\n\u2022$5.4 million of decreased lab expenses and platform costs;\n\u2022$3.1 million of decreased net employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by a decrease of $6.8 million in stock-based compensation expense due to an overall decrease in the value of awards, offset by an increase due to our employee retention program in 2021.\n\u2022$2.5 million of decreased consulting expenses; and\n\u2022$2.2 million of decreased medical research costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $210.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $240.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease of $30.0 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$17.3 million of decreased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by a decrease of $17.1 million in stock-based compensation expense due to an overall decrease in the value of awards, partially offset by an increase primarily driven by our employee retention program in 2021;\n\u2022$7.4 million of decreased costs related to consultants;\n\u2022$7.2 million of decreased costs related to commercial readiness activities due to delays in commercialization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our decision to focus our efforts on the U.S. market for beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel; and\n\u2022$2.6 million of decreased costs related to professional service costs.\nThese decreased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$4.6 million of increased costs related to information technology and facility-related costs.\nCost of product revenue. Cost of product revenue was $38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We did not have cost of product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase is attributable to costs of sales associated with product sales of ZYNTEGLO in Germany as well as the reserves for excess inventory recognized during the second and third quarters of 2021 based on forecasted consumption levels due to the winddown of our European operations.\nRestructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses were $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We did not have restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in restructuring expenses is primarily related to the costs associated with the reduction in workforce as a result of our decision to wind down our European operations.\nInterest income, net. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily related to decreased interest income earned on investments due to an overall decrease in investments.\nOther income (expense), net. The change in other income (expense), net was primarily related to the gain recognized on equity securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Table 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>319,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>327,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,810) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>239,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>235,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,106 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>559,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>562,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,704) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(559,259) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(562,963) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,704 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net </td> <td>5,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,380 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,610) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net </td> <td>(6,881) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,984) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,103 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(560,370) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555,567) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,803) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit </td> <td>(686) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,231) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from continuing operations </td> <td>(561,056) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555,022) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,034) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss from discontinued operations </td> <td>(57,639) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234,586) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176,947 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(618,695) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(789,608) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $319.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $327.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease of $7.8 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$6.9 million of decreased value-added taxes;\n\u2022$3.6 million of decreased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by a decrease of $9.6 million in stock-based compensation expense offset by an increase in research and development headcount to support overall growth;\n\u2022$2.2 million of decreased medical research costs;\n\u2022$2.1 million of decreased information technology and facility-related costs;\n\u2022$1.6 million of decreased lab costs; and\n\u2022$1.3 million of decreased collaboration research funding costs.\nThese decreased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$8.7 million of increased material production and non-clinical services costs; and\n\u2022$1.8 million of increased consulting costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $240.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $235.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of approximately $4.1 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$8.4 million of increased information technology and facility-related costs primarily due to increased investment in software applications and technology; and\n\u2022$5.3 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$8.3 million of decreased costs related to commercial readiness activities due to delays in commercial launch activities during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022$1.6 million of decreased consulting and professional service fees primarily related to commercial strategy and product marketing.\nInterest income, net. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily related to decreased interest income earned on investments due to an overall decrease in interest rates.\nOther expense, net. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. As of December 31, 2021, our funds are primarily held in U.S. government agency securities and treasuries, equity securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market accounts.\nWe have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception in April 1992, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $3.72 billion. We expect that we will continue to incur significant research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations within the next twelve months, which we may raise through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources which are not entirely within our control nor have been approved by our Board of Directors as of the date of this filing. Potential additional funding from other sources includes the sale of priority review vouchers, if received.\nThe likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, and potential delays to be encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations. These factors create substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The\naccompanying Consolidated Financial Statements ( CFS\u201d) were prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The CFS do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have funded our operations principally from the sale of common stock in public offerings and through our collaborations with BMS as outlined below:\n\u2022In May 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Co-Development, Co-Promote and Profit Share Agreement (as amended, the Amended Ide-cel CCPS\u201d) and the Second Amended and Restated bb21217 License Agreement ( Amended bb21217 License Agreement\u201d) with BMS (relating to our ide-cel and bb21217 programs which were assigned to 2seventy bio effective upon completion of the Separation), pursuant to which BMS modified its obligations to pay us for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on commercial sales by making a one-time up-front payment of $200.0 million.\n\u2022In May 2020, we sold 10.5 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $55.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $541.5 million.\n\u2022On July 2021, we sold our bluebird Research Triangle manufacturing facility in North Carolina as part of an agreement with National Resilience, Inc (\"Resilience\"). In consideration, upon closing of the transaction we received $110.3 million from Resilience.\n\u2022In September 2021, we sold 2.3 million shares of common stock through a private placement offering of securities at a price of $16.50 per share as well as pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 2.3 million shares of common stock at an effective price of $16.49 per share ($16.49 paid to us upon the closing of the offering and $0.01 to be paid upon exercise of such pre-funded warrants) for aggregate gross proceeds of $75.0 million.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe discussion of our cash flows that follows does not include the impact of any adjustments to remove discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted, and is stated on a total company consolidated basis. The separation of our oncology business may have a negative impact on our cash flows in future periods.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity: Table 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(635,639) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(470,351) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(564,384) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>562,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(84,345) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507,807 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td>(93,954) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,187 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(167,036) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,981) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,390) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities.

The Assignment transfers our interest in the lease to 2seventy bio and releases us from our obligation to maintain the $13.8 million collateralized letter of credit required under the original 60 Binney Street lease. Although the lease was legally transferred to 2seventy bio, the lessor required that we remain secondarily liable as a guarantor for payment obligations accruing under the 60 Binney Street lease from the date of Assignment until (i) we have completely vacated the premises and (ii) 2seventy bio has reached a market capitalization of $900 million. Upon Separation, the lease assignment was accounted for as the termination of the original lease and we de-recognized the right-of-use asset and lease liability related to the 60 Binney Street lease and recognized the fair value of the guarantee pursuant to ASC 405, Liabilities. The fair value of the guarantee was not material.\nConcurrent with the Assignment of the 60 Binney Street lease, we entered into a sublease agreement with 2seventy bio for office, laboratory and storage space located at 60 Binney Street (the \"60 Binney Street Sublease\") while we construct and outfit our new office and laboratory space. Under the terms of the 60 Binney Street Sublease, we will lease 72,988 square feet for $0.5 million per month in base rent for the period beginning from the Assignment through March 2022 and 58,004 square feet for $0.4 million per month in base rent for the period from April 2022 through March 2024. We will also pay monthly fees for use of the facilities and support personnel, calculated based on our pro-rata share of operating costs during the term of the 60 Binney Street Sublease. We accounted for the 60 Binney Street Sublease as a new lease under ASC 842, and in November 2021, we recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability related to the 60 Binney Street Sublease.\n50 Binney Street sublease\nIn April 2019, we entered into a sublease agreement for office space located at 50 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the \"50 Binney Street Sublease\") to supplement our corporate headquarters located at 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the 50 Binney Street Sublease, we will lease 267,278 square feet of office space for $99.95 per square foot, or $26.7 million per year in base rent subject to certain operating expenses, taxes and annual rent increases of approximately 3%. The lease will commence when the space is available for use, which is anticipated to be in the\nfirst half of 2022, which reflects the sublessor's exercise of its option to postpone the commencement date of the sublease, and end on December 31, 2030, unless other conditions specified in the 50 Binney Street Sublease occur. Upon signing the 50 Binney Street Sublease, we executed a $40.1 million cash-collateralized letter of credit, which may be reduced in the future subject to the terms of the 50 Binney Street Sublease and certain reduction requirements specified therein. The $40.1 million of cash collateralizing the letter of credit is classified as restricted cash and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Payments will commence at the earlier of (i) the date which is 90 days following the commencement date and (ii) the date we take occupancy of all or any portion of the premises. In connection with the execution of the 50 Binney Street Sublease, we also entered into a purchase agreement for furniture and equipment (the Furniture Purchase Agreement\u201d) located on the premises upon lease commencement. Upon execution of the Furniture Purchase Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $7.5 million, all of which was recorded within restricted cash and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets and assessed for recoverability on a recurring basis.\nIn December 2021, we entered into a sub-sublease agreement with Meta Platforms. Inc. (\"Meta\"). Under the terms of the sub-sublease, we are subleasing the entirety of the 50 Binney Street premises which we have rights to under the sublease. We are sub-subleasing the premises for $28.0 million in the first year with 3% annual increases in each subsequent year. Meta will receive access to 50 Binney Street at the lease commencement date, which is the same point that we would receive access under the sublease. We remain liable under the sublease, including for the maintenance of the $40.1 million collateralized letter of credit. As a result of the execution of the sub-sublease, we assessed the $7.5 million deposit related to the Furniture Purchase Agreement for recoverability and determined that the amount was not recoverable. As a result, we recorded $7.5 million in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as selling, general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAssembly Row lease\nIn November 2021, we entered into a lease agreement with Assembly Row 5B, LLC (the \"Landlord\") for office space located at 455 Grand Union Boulevard in Somerville, Massachusetts to serve as our future headquarters. Under the terms of the arrangement, we will lease approximately 61,180 square feet starting at an annual rate of $45 per square foot, subject to annual increases of 2.5%, plus operating expenses and taxes. In addition, we will be eligible for a tenant work allowance of $160 per rentable square foot of the premises. The lease will commence on the date on which the Landlord tenders possession of the premises to us with any tenant work required to be performed by the Landlord substantially completed, which is anticipated to occur in the first half of 2022.\nEmbedded leases\nIn June 2016, we entered into a manufacturing agreement for the future commercial production of our beti-cel and eli-cel drug products with a contract manufacturing organization. Under this 12-year agreement, the contract manufacturing organization will complete the design, construction, validation and process validation of the leased suites prior to anticipated commercial launch of the product candidates. During construction, we paid $12.0 million upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. We paid $5.0 million for the achievement of the first and second contractual milestones during 2016 and paid $5.5 million for the third and fourth contractual milestones achieved during 2017. In March 2018, $1.5 million of the possible $2.0 million related to the fifth contractual milestone was achieved and was paid in the second quarter of 2018. Construction was completed in March 2018, and beginning in April 2018 we paid $5.1 million per year in fixed suite fees as well as certain fixed labor, raw materials, testing and shipping costs for manufacturing services. We may terminate this agreement at any time upon payment of a one-time termination fee and up to 24 months of fixed suite and labor fees. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded lease as the suites are designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement. We concluded that we are not the deemed owner during construction nor is it a capital lease under ASC 840-10, Leases - Overall. As a result, in prior periods we accounted for the agreement as an operating lease under ASC 840 and recognized straight-line rent expense over the non-cancellable term of the embedded lease. As part of our adoption of ASC 842, effective January 1, 2019, we carried forward the existing lease classification under ASC 840. Additionally, we recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for this operating lease on the effective date and are recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis throughout the remaining term of the embedded lease.\nIn November 2016, we entered into an agreement for clinical and commercial production of our beti-cel, lovo-cel, and eli-cel drug products with a contract manufacturing organization at an existing facility. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded operating lease as the clean rooms are designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement. The term of the agreement is five years with subsequent three-year renewals at the mutual option of each party. As a result, we recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for this operating lease on the effective date of ASC 842, and are recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis throughout the estimated remaining term of the embedded lease. In March 2020, we amended this agreement with the contract manufacturing organization, resulting in a lease modification. Under the terms of the\namended arrangement, we may be required to pay annual maintenance and production fees of up to \u20ac16.5 million, depending on its production needs, and may terminate this agreement with twelve months' notice and a one-time termination fee. The amendment also provides for an option to reserve an additional clean room for a one-time option fee plus annual maintenance fees. As a result, we increased the right-of-use asset and lease liability related to this embedded operating lease during the first quarter of 2020. In September 2021, we reassessed the term of this lease in light of the planned orderly wind down of its operations in Europe. As a result, we reduced the right-of-use asset and related lease liability to reflect a shortened expected term of the agreement. In November 2021, we exercised our right to terminate the lease agreement, and such termination will be effective in November 2022. Per the terms of the amended agreement, we were obligated to pay a one-time termination fee of \u20ac1.0 million upon termination, which was paid in December 2021. In connection with this termination, we will pay for services properly rendered through the date of termination in accordance with the contract manufacturing agreement, based on work completed and expenses incurred prior to the date of termination.\nIn July 2020, we entered into an agreement reserving manufacturing capacity with a contract manufacturing organization. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded lease as a controlled environment room at the facility is designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement, with the option to sublease the space if we provide notice that we will not utilize it for a specified duration of time. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be required to pay up to $5.4 million per year in maintenance fees in addition to the cost of any services provided and may terminate this agreement with eighteen months' notice. The term of the agreement is five years, with the option to extend, and the agreement commenced in March 2021. We classified the embedded lease as an operating lease and recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability upon lease commencement in March 2021 and are recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis throughout the remaining term of the embedded lease.\nIn February 2021, we entered into another agreement reserving manufacturing capacity with a contract manufacturing organization. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded lease as a controlled environment room at the facility is designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement. We also have the option to sublease the space if we provide notice that we will not utilize it for a specified duration of time. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to pay up to $4.2 million per year in maintenance fees and an immaterial amount of other annual fees as well as per-batch fees for the cost of any services provided. Either party may terminate this agreement with eighteen months' notice at any time or with eight months' notice after stage 5 has commenced. The term of the agreement is five years, with the option to extend. The agreement commenced in November 2021 and upon commencement we classified the embedded lease as an operating lease and recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis throughout the remaining term of the embedded lease.\nContingent Milestone and Royalty Payments\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing of a BLA, approval by the FDA or product launch). We do not recognize these commitments in our financial statements until they become payable or have been paid.\nBased on our development plans as of December 31, 2021, we may be obligated to make future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments on future sales of specified products associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of such milestones or sales. Because the achievement of these milestones or sales had not occurred as of December 31, 2021, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments and sales-based royalties are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent upon success.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Inserm-Transfert pursuant to which we license certain patents and know-how for use in adrenoleukodystrophy therapy, we will be required to make payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate payments we may be obligated to pay for each of these milestone categories per product is \u20ac0.3, \u20ac0.2 and \u20ac1.6 million, respectively. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Institut Pasteur pursuant to which we license certain patents for use in ex vivo gene therapy, we will be required to make payments per product covered by the in-licensed intellectual property upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones, depending on the indication and the method of treatment. The maximum aggregate payments we may be obligated to pay for each of these milestone categories per product is \u20ac1.5 and \u20ac2.0 million, respectively. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-\nlicensed intellectual property in the low single digits, which varies slightly depending on the indication of the product. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income varying from the low single digits to mid-range double digits depending on the nature of the sublicense and stage of development. We are required to make an annual maintenance payment, which is creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. On April 1, 2015, we amended this license agreement with Institut Pasteur, which resulted in a payment of \u20ac3.0 million that was paid during the second quarter of 2015.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (\"Stanford\") pursuant to which we license the HEK293T cell line for use in gene therapy products, we are required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits that varies with net sales. The royalty is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one percent. We have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (\"MIT\") pursuant to which we license various patents, we will be required to make a payment of $0.1 million based upon a regulatory filing milestone. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property by us or our sublicensees. The royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one percent. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income varying from the mid-single digits to low double digits. We are required to pay MIT an annual maintenance fee based on net sales of licensed products, which is creditable against our royalty payments.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Research Development Foundation pursuant to which we license patents that involve LVV, we will be required to make payments of $1.0 million based upon a regulatory milestone for each product covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits, which is reduced by half if during the ten years following first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with SIRION Biotech GmbH (\"Sirion\") pursuant to which we license certain patents directed to manufacturing related to our LentiGlobin product candidate, we will be required to make certain payments related to certain development milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $13.4 million in the aggregate for each product covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we will be obligated to pay Sirion a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. The royalties payable under this license agreement are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits.\nOther Funding Commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. We have also entered into multi-year agreements with a manufacturing partner in the United States (Henogen, previously Novasep, and now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), which is partnering with us on production of LVV for lovo-cel. In addition, we have entered into a multi-year agreement with Lonza Houston, Inc. to produce drug product for beti-cel and eli-cel. Currently, SAFC Carlsbad, Inc. (\"SAFC\", a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma), is the sole manufacturer of the LVV for eli-cel and beti-cel. In our manufacturing agreement with Minaris, we reserve production capacity for the manufacture of our drug product. Our total non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from these manufacturing agreements is $53.8 million, with $43.9 million of these obligations due within the next twelve months. We believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to effectively oversee these contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions and potential commercial launch. We are engaging with apheresis and infusion centers, which we refer to as qualified treatment centers, that will be the centers for collection of HSCs from the patient and for infusion of drug product to the patient. For the treatment of patients with our drug product in the commercial setting, we are entering into agreements with participating qualified treatment centers in the jurisdictions where we plan to commercialize our products. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice. Wherever contracts include stipulated commitment payments, we have included such payments in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operating results of a biotechnology company focused on developing gene therapies for severe genetic diseases.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform. Our gene therapy programs in severe genetic diseases include programs for \u03b2-thalassemia, SCD, and CALD. We also expect to make focused investments in research and development efforts on optimizing our existing programs as well as on pipeline programs in severe genetic diseases. The BLA for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with \u03b2-thalassemia who receive regular RBC transfusions was accepted for priority review by the FDA, and the PDUFA goal date is August 19, 2022. The BLA for eli-cel as a treatment for patients less than 18 years of age with early CALD was accepted for priority review by the FDA, and the PDUFA goal date is September 16, 2022. We are developing lovo-cel as a treatment for patients with SCD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for lovo-cel in the United States on the basis of clinical data from HGB-206 Group C, with supporting data from HGB-210. We have treated all of the patients who will form the primary basis of efficacy for approval, with the demonstration of analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process as the key remaining actions prior to submission of our planned BLA for lovo-cel. In December 2021, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our clinical program for lovo-cel for enrolling patients under the age of 18. During the partial clinical hold, we anticipate continuing our clinical study activities as planned for patients 18 and older in HGB-210, as well as follow-up activities for treated patients of all ages in all studies.\nWe are focusing our development and commercialization efforts in the U.S. market. We have submitted a request for the withdrawal of the marketing authorization for beti-cel in the European Union, to be effective in the first half of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have withdrawn the marketing authorization for eli-cel in the European Union. We are continuing the long-term follow-up of patients previously enrolled within the clinical trial programs in Europe as planned but do not intend to initiate any new clinical trials in Europe for \u03b2-thalassemia, CALD or SCD. As a result, we anticipate a reduction of selling, general and administrative costs and an impact on our excess inventory analysis as future lots are produced, which is based on forecasted consumption levels driven by sales forecasts.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including activities to manufacture product candidates in compliance with good manufacturing practices (\"GMP\") to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, to provide selling, general and administrative support for these operations and to protect our intellectual property. We have not generated material revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock in our public offerings, private placements of preferred stock and warrants and through collaborations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net loss from continuing operations was $562.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our accumulated deficit was $3.72 billion as of December 31, 2021. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years, as we:\n\u2022fund activities related to the potential commercial launches of our late-stage product candidates in the United States;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022scale our manufacturing capabilities in support of potential commercialization following any regulatory approvals;\n\u2022conduct clinical studies for our clinical programs in \u03b2-thalassemia and SCD, and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development; and\n\u2022increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates and technologies in severe genetic diseases.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nBusiness update\nWe continue to experience disruptions and increased risk related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the timing of patient treatment in Europe in the commercial context, and the timing of our ongoing clinical studies, with the result of slower patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical studies and delays in post-treatment follow up visits, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and by program. It has also affected our activities with and operations at our third-party manufacturers. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. As a result of the demands upon healthcare regulatory authorities, review, inspection, and other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development may be impacted, and may result in delays for an unknown period of time.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory, and a flexible work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel.\nWe are working with our clinical study sites to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on activities for our ongoing clinical studies. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict.\nIn March 2021, we placed a portion of our internal LVV manufacturing facility into service, while still completing qualification of the remaining portion. In September 2021, we completed the sale of this LVV manufacturing facility to National Resilience, Inc. Currently all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties and we utilize third-party contract research organizations (\"CROs\") to carry out our clinical development activities. As we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin commercialization following marketing approval, if obtained, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution at such time. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales at such time, we will continue to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.\nIn April 2021, we announced our decision to withdraw ZYNTEGLO from the German market because reimbursement negotiations in Germany did not result in a price for ZYNTEGLO that reflects the value of the one-time gene therapy with potential life-long benefit for people living with transfusion dependent \u03b2-thalassemia. A total of approximately 50 employees were impacted by this reduction. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we substantially completed the implementation of this reduction and, in accordance with ASC 420, Exit and Disposal Activities, and ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment\nBenefits, recorded approximately $4.6 million of costs including severance, the portion of the employees' 2021 retention bonuses to be paid in cash, and the pro rata portion of the employees' 2021 performance bonus.\nIn July 2021, we made the decision to focus our efforts on the U.S. market for beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel and are executing an orderly wind down of our European operations. A total of approximately 90 employees were impacted by the reduction in workforce associated with this decision. We recorded $21.2 million of expense, in accordance with the related accounting standards mentioned above, for the affected employees.\nAll costs associated with the April 2021 and July 2021 reductions are reflected within restructuring expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 17, Reduction in Workforce, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million as of December 31, 2021. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 205-40, Going Concern, we evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of our plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In performing this analysis, we excluded certain elements of our operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future equity or debt issuances, the release of restricted cash related to the Company's 50 Binney Street sublease, and the potential sale of priority review vouchers, if received, cannot be considered probable at this time because none of the plans are entirely within the Company's control or have been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of the financial statements.\nOur expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our plan to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced 2022 spending, including projected savings through the move of the Company's headquarters to Assembly Row in Somerville, Massachusetts, the orderly wind down of European operations, the potential sale of priority review vouchers that would be issued with anticipated U.S. regulatory approvals of BLAs for beti-cel and eli-cel, and the pursuit of additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. We have concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nOur legacy business\nOn November 4, 2021, we completed the separation of our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, publicly traded companies: bluebird bio, Inc. and 2seventy bio, Inc. (\"2seventy bio\"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary prior to the separation (the \"Separation\"). The Separation was effected by means of a distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of 2seventy bio in which each bluebird stockholder received one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of 2seventy bio for every three shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of bluebird held as of the close of business on October 19, 2021 (the \"Distribution\").\nWe intend to focus on our severe genetic disease programs and 2seventy bio is expected to focus on the separated oncology programs. In collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (\"BMS\"), 2seventy bio is commercializing idecabtagene vicleucel (\"ide-cel\") and developing bb21217 as treatments for multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy that develops in the bone marrow and is fatal if untreated. 2seventy bio is co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel as ABECMA in the United States with BMS and has exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. It\nhas exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for 2seventy bio to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In March 2021, BMS received marketing approval from the FDA for ide-cel, marketed as ABECMA, as a treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Sales of ABECMA by BMS began in the second quarter of 2021.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a separation agreement with 2seventy bio, dated as of November 3, 2021, that, among other things, sets forth our agreements with 2seventy bio regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Separation, including the Distribution. In connection with the Separation, we also entered into certain other agreements with 2seventy bio, including transition services agreements. Pursuant to the transition services agreements, we are obligated to provide and are entitled to receive certain transition services related to corporate functions, such as finance, human resources, internal audit, research and development, financial reporting, and information technology. The separation and the aforementioned agreements are more fully described in Note 3, Discontinued operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial operations overview\nProduct revenue\nOur revenues have primarily been derived from product revenues associated with the sale of ZYNTEGLO in Germany.\nOther revenue\nWe have recognized an immaterial amount of revenue associated with grants and collaboration agreements.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;\n\u2022reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;\n\u2022costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;\n\u2022milestones and upfront license payments;\n\u2022costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangible assets.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates, including:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;\n\u2022future clinical study results;\n\u2022uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our LVV or drug product;\n\u2022regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and\n\u2022the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel, and conduct research and development activities in our pipeline programs. Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:\n\u2022for the clinical studies of beti-cel, consisting of HGB-207, HGB-212, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022for the clinical studies of lovo-cel, consisting of HGB-206, HGB-210, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022for the clinical studies of eli-cel, consisting of ALD-104, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022research and development activities for platform technology and our preclinical pipeline programs; and\n\u2022for the manufacture of clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.\nWe expect that the timing of investment in our ongoing clinical studies will reflect COVID-19 related delays in these studies.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below: \n(1)Prior to 2020, costs within these categories were disclosed as \"platform-related expenses.\"\n(2)Prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Separation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors' fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and sales and marketing expenses, will continue to increase in the future relative to current levels as we perform commercial readiness activities in the United States for our product candidates.\nCost of product revenue\nCost of product revenue includes costs associated with the sale of ZYNTEGLO in Germany.\nRestructuring expenses\nWe record costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit and Disposal Cost Obligations, and other costs and liabilities associated with postemployment nonretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 712, Postemployment Nonretirement Benefits. Such costs are based on the estimate of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred. We evaluate and adjust costs as appropriate for changes in circumstances as additional information becomes available.\nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of gains and losses on equity securities held by us, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nDiscontinued operations\nNet loss from discontinued operations consists of the results of our oncology business and our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina and is reported as a separate component of income.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nDiscontinued operations\nWe determined that the Separation of our oncology business on November 4, 2021 and the sale of our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina in July 2021 represented multiple components of a single disposal plan that met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-20, Discontinued Operations. Accordingly,\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods have been updated to present the assets and liabilities associated with the oncology business and the manufacturing facility separately as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet and the results of all discontinued operations reported as a separate component of income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFor additional information related to discontinued operations, refer to Note 3, Discontinued operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue recognition\nUnder Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d) on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIf an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform. Our gene therapy programs in severe genetic diseases include programs for \u03b2-thalassemia, SCD, and CALD. We also expect to make focused investments in research and development efforts on optimizing our existing programs as well as on pipeline programs in severe genetic diseases. The BLA for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with \u03b2-thalassemia who receive regular RBC transfusions was accepted for priority review by the FDA, and the PDUFA goal date is August 19, 2022. The BLA for eli-cel as a treatment for patients less than 18 years of age with early CALD was accepted for priority review by the FDA, and the PDUFA goal date is September 16, 2022. We are developing lovo-cel as a treatment for patients with SCD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for lovo-cel in the United States on the basis of clinical data from HGB-206 Group C, with supporting data from HGB-210. We have treated all of the patients who will form the primary basis of efficacy for approval, with the demonstration of analytical comparability and validation of our commercial manufacturing process as the key remaining actions prior to submission of our planned BLA for lovo-cel. In December 2021, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our clinical program for lovo-cel for enrolling patients under the age of 18. During the partial clinical hold, we anticipate continuing our clinical study activities as planned for patients 18 and older in HGB-210, as well as follow-up activities for treated patients of all ages in all studies.\nWe are focusing our development and commercialization efforts in the U.S. market. We have submitted a request for the withdrawal of the marketing authorization for beti-cel in the European Union, to be effective in the first half of 2022. As of December 31, 2021, we have withdrawn the marketing authorization for eli-cel in the European Union. We are continuing the long-term follow-up of patients previously enrolled within the clinical trial programs in Europe as planned but do not intend to initiate any new clinical trials in Europe for \u03b2-thalassemia, CALD or SCD. As a result, we anticipate a reduction of selling, general and administrative costs and an impact on our excess inventory analysis as future lots are produced, which is based on forecasted consumption levels driven by sales forecasts.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including activities to manufacture product candidates in compliance with good manufacturing practices (\"GMP\") to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, to provide selling, general and administrative support for these operations and to protect our intellectual property. We have not generated material revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock in our public offerings, private placements of preferred stock and warrants and through collaborations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net loss from continuing operations was $562.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our accumulated deficit was $3.72 billion as of December 31, 2021. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years, as we:\n\u2022fund activities related to the potential commercial launches of our late-stage product candidates in the United States;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022scale our manufacturing capabilities in support of potential commercialization following any regulatory approvals;\n\u2022conduct clinical studies for our clinical programs in \u03b2-thalassemia and SCD, and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development; and\n\u2022increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates and technologies in severe genetic diseases.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nBusiness update\nWe continue to experience disruptions and increased risk related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the timing of patient treatment in Europe in the commercial context, and the timing of our ongoing clinical studies, with the result of slower patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical studies and delays in post-treatment follow up visits, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and by program. It has also affected our activities with and operations at our third-party manufacturers. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. As a result of the demands upon healthcare regulatory authorities, review, inspection, and other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development may be impacted, and may result in delays for an unknown period of time.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory, and a flexible work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel.\nWe are working with our clinical study sites to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on activities for our ongoing clinical studies. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict.\nIn March 2021, we placed a portion of our internal LVV manufacturing facility into service, while still completing qualification of the remaining portion. In September 2021, we completed the sale of this LVV manufacturing facility to National Resilience, Inc. Currently all of our manufacturing activities are contracted out to third parties and we utilize third-party contract research organizations (\"CROs\") to carry out our clinical development activities. As we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin commercialization following marketing approval, if obtained, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution at such time. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales at such time, we will continue to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.\nIn April 2021, we announced our decision to withdraw ZYNTEGLO from the German market because reimbursement negotiations in Germany did not result in a price for ZYNTEGLO that reflects the value of the one-time gene therapy with potential life-long benefit for people living with transfusion dependent \u03b2-thalassemia. A total of approximately 50 employees were impacted by this reduction. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we substantially completed the implementation of this reduction and, in accordance with ASC 420, Exit and Disposal Activities, and ASC 712, Nonretirement Postemployment\nBenefits, recorded approximately $4.6 million of costs including severance, the portion of the employees' 2021 retention bonuses to be paid in cash, and the pro rata portion of the employees' 2021 performance bonus.\nIn July 2021, we made the decision to focus our efforts on the U.S. market for beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel and are executing an orderly wind down of our European operations. A total of approximately 90 employees were impacted by the reduction in workforce associated with this decision. We recorded $21.2 million of expense, in accordance with the related accounting standards mentioned above, for the affected employees.\nAll costs associated with the April 2021 and July 2021 reductions are reflected within restructuring expenses in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. See Note 17, Reduction in Workforce, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $396.6 million as of December 31, 2021. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 205-40, Going Concern, we evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of our plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. In performing this analysis, we excluded certain elements of our operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Under ASC 205-40, the future receipt of potential funding from future equity or debt issuances, the release of restricted cash related to the Company's 50 Binney Street sublease, and the potential sale of priority review vouchers, if received, cannot be considered probable at this time because none of the plans are entirely within the Company's control or have been approved by the Board of Directors as of the date of the financial statements.\nOur expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Our plan to alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt include reduced 2022 spending, including projected savings through the move of the Company's headquarters to Assembly Row in Somerville, Massachusetts, the orderly wind down of European operations, the potential sale of priority review vouchers that would be issued with anticipated U.S. regulatory approvals of BLAs for beti-cel and eli-cel, and the pursuit of additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings. We have concluded the likelihood that its plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.\nOur legacy business\nOn November 4, 2021, we completed the separation of our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, publicly traded companies: bluebird bio, Inc. and 2seventy bio, Inc. (\"2seventy bio\"), a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary prior to the separation (the \"Separation\"). The Separation was effected by means of a distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of 2seventy bio in which each bluebird stockholder received one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of 2seventy bio for every three shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of bluebird held as of the close of business on October 19, 2021 (the \"Distribution\").\nWe intend to focus on our severe genetic disease programs and 2seventy bio is expected to focus on the separated oncology programs. In collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb (\"BMS\"), 2seventy bio is commercializing idecabtagene vicleucel (\"ide-cel\") and developing bb21217 as treatments for multiple myeloma, a hematologic malignancy that develops in the bone marrow and is fatal if untreated. 2seventy bio is co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel as ABECMA in the United States with BMS and has exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. It\nhas exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for 2seventy bio to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In March 2021, BMS received marketing approval from the FDA for ide-cel, marketed as ABECMA, as a treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Sales of ABECMA by BMS began in the second quarter of 2021.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into a separation agreement with 2seventy bio, dated as of November 3, 2021, that, among other things, sets forth our agreements with 2seventy bio regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Separation, including the Distribution. In connection with the Separation, we also entered into certain other agreements with 2seventy bio, including transition services agreements. Pursuant to the transition services agreements, we are obligated to provide and are entitled to receive certain transition services related to corporate functions, such as finance, human resources, internal audit, research and development, financial reporting, and information technology. The separation and the aforementioned agreements are more fully described in Note 3, Discontinued operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial operations overview\nProduct revenue\nOur revenues have primarily been derived from product revenues associated with the sale of ZYNTEGLO in Germany.\nOther revenue\nWe have recognized an immaterial amount of revenue associated with grants and collaboration agreements.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;\n\u2022reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;\n\u2022costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;\n\u2022milestones and upfront license payments;\n\u2022costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangible assets.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates, including:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;\n\u2022future clinical study results;\n\u2022uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our LVV or drug product;\n\u2022regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and\n\u2022the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of beti-cel, eli-cel, and lovo-cel, and conduct research and development activities in our pipeline programs. Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:\n\u2022for the clinical studies of beti-cel, consisting of HGB-207, HGB-212, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022for the clinical studies of lovo-cel, consisting of HGB-206, HGB-210, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022for the clinical studies of eli-cel, consisting of ALD-104, and the associated long-term follow-up protocol;\n\u2022research and development activities for platform technology and our preclinical pipeline programs; and\n\u2022for the manufacture of clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.\nWe expect that the timing of investment in our ongoing clinical studies will reflect COVID-19 related delays in these studies.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below: Table 9: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2019 (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>beti-cel </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,292 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,896 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>lovo-cel (formerly LentiGlobin for SCD)\n</td> <td>64,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>eli-cel </td> <td>54,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,352 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical programs </td> <td>7,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,644 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total direct research and development expense </td> <td>179,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>166,239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee- and contractor-related expenses </td> <td>48,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,255 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,619 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>42,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Laboratory and related expenses(1)\n</td> <td>5,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other collaboration expenses(1)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility expenses </td> <td>41,898 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,400 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other research and development expenses </td> <td>139,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,880 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>319,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>327,119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Prior to 2020, costs within these categories were disclosed as \"platform-related expenses.\"\n(2)Prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Separation.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors' fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and sales and marketing expenses, will continue to increase in the future relative to current levels as we perform commercial readiness activities in the United States for our product candidates.\nCost of product revenue\nCost of product revenue includes costs associated with the sale of ZYNTEGLO in Germany.\nRestructuring expenses\nWe record costs and liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit and Disposal Cost Obligations, and other costs and liabilities associated with postemployment nonretirement benefits in accordance with ASC 712, Postemployment Nonretirement Benefits. Such costs are based on the estimate of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred. We evaluate and adjust costs as appropriate for changes in circumstances as additional information becomes available.\nInterest income, net\nInterest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists primarily of gains and losses on equity securities held by us, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nDiscontinued operations\nNet loss from discontinued operations consists of the results of our oncology business and our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina and is reported as a separate component of income.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nDiscontinued operations\nWe determined that the Separation of our oncology business on November 4, 2021 and the sale of our manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina in July 2021 represented multiple components of a single disposal plan that met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-20, Discontinued Operations. Accordingly,\nthe accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods have been updated to present the assets and liabilities associated with the oncology business and the manufacturing facility separately as discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet and the results of all discontinued operations reported as a separate component of income in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nFor additional information related to discontinued operations, refer to Note 3, Discontinued operations, to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue recognition\nUnder Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d) on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIf an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is"}
