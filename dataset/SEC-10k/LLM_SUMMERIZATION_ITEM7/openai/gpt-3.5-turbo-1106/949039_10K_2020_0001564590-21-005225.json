Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements (including the Notes thereto) in Item 8 of this report.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. For a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018, please refer to Item 7 of Part II, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2019 filed with the SEC on February 18, 2020.\nWe provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe with a fleet of 13 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of four drillships and nine semisubmersible rigs, including two semisubmersible rigs that are cold stacked as of the date of this report. Our current fleet excludes the Ocean America and Ocean Rover, which we are actively marketing for sale. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRecent Developments\nSince the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have continued to operate our business as a debtor-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Additionally, as a debtor-in-possession, certain of our activities are subject to review and approval by the Bankruptcy Court, including, among other things, the incurrence of secured indebtedness, material asset dispositions, and other transactions outside the ordinary course of business. There can be no guarantee that the Chapter 11 Cases will be completed successfully or in the time frame contemplated by the PSA. The Consenting Stakeholders and we made certain customary commitments to each other, including the Consenting Stakeholders committing to vote to approve the Plan.\nThrough the financial restructuring contemplated in the PSA and the Plan, we, the Debtors, expect to emerge from the Chapter 11 cases with a capital structure that we expect will position the Debtors for future success in the offshore drilling industry.\nThe risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the defaults under our Debt Instruments, and the weak industry conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern.\nFor additional information concerning our Chapter 11 Cases, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases -\u201d in Item 1A of this report and Note 2 Chapter 11 Proceedings\u201d and Note 18 Subsequent Event\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nMarket Overview\nThe offshore contract drilling market continues to be severely challenged by an oversupply of rigs and continued depressed commodity prices, leading to a continuation of the prolonged industry downturn, a reduction in the number of drilling projects being sanctioned and increased competition.\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak and resulting measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, including government-imposed lockdowns, restrictions and travel bans, contributed to a dramatic fall in demand for oil during 2020. The modest success of COVID-19 restrictions and mitigation protocols in slowing the spread of the virus and the recent development and ongoing distribution of vaccines to combat COVID-19 have resulted in the easing of lockdowns and restrictions in some areas, as well as a gradual increase in demand for oil. However, the increase in demand has been tempered by struggling economies in parts of the globe remaining in various stages of lockdown due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\nCommodity prices have risen modestly since the start of the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to an agreement reached by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing nations on oil\nproduction quotas. The production cuts agreed to in April 2020 were subject to a tapering plan that increased oil production at points during the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As of the date of this report, the price for Brent crude oil had risen to the $60-per-barrel range, buoyed by optimism resulting from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and a January 2021 agreement by Saudi Arabia to reduce oil production to partially offset an increase in Russian production. Despite the modest recovery in commodity price since the first quarter of 2020, some analysts expect downward pressure on oil prices to persist in 2021 due to continuing concerns related to COVID-19 and the uncertain longevity of oil production quotas. Some industry analysts also predict that oil demand recovery/growth will be slowed by increasing fuel efficiency standards and decarbonization efforts. As a result, depressed commodity prices could continue for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result of low commodity prices and uncertain global demand, many exploration and production companies, including some of our customers, made significant reductions in their capital spending programs in 2020, resulting in the early release of some offshore rigs from drilling programs or termination of contracts. Other drilling programs were paused or put on hold in response to the need for COVID-19 containment. Some industry analysts predict that capital spending programs in 2021 will remain flat or perhaps decline compared to 2020. Given the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors, many customers have elected to defer previously sanctioned offshore drilling projects, which negatively impacts utilization.\nAt the end of 2020, based on industry reports, global floater contracted utilization was approximately 60%, with 126 of 212 available rigs contracted. In addition, industry analysts report that 26 floater rigs remain on order, with no floater deliveries having occurred in 2020. Only two of the twelve rigs on order scheduled for delivery in 2021 have been contracted for future work. The remaining rigs on order, none of which are contracted for future work, are scheduled for delivery in 2022 and 2023. Industry analysts also estimate that available rig supply will increase in 2021 as more than 50 of the currently contracted floaters will complete their contracts during the year and be available, increasing competition. To manage supply and reduce expenses in an oversupplied and highly competitive market, drilling contractors retired 24 floaters during 2020 based on industry data. Additionally, during periods of rig oversupply, it is not uncommon for a drilling contractor to elect to forego upcoming special surveys of rigs rolling off contract with no future work, resulting in the cold stacking or ultimate retirement of a rig. Historically, the longer a drilling rig remains cold stacked, the cost of reactivation increases and the likelihood of reactivation decreases.\nDuring 2020, we recognized asset impairments aggregating $842.0 million to write down four semisubmersible rigs to their estimated fair values. If market fundamentals in the offshore oil and gas industry continue to deteriorate or a market recovery is further delayed, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. As of the date of this report, we have two cold-stacked semisubmersible rigs, one of which has not been previously impaired. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAs a result of the continuing protracted industry downturn and these challenges, we are continuing to actively seek ways to drive efficiency, reduce non-productive time and provide technical innovation to our customers. We expect these innovations and efficiencies to result in faster and safer drilling and completion of wells, leading to lower overall well costs to the benefit of our customers.\nSee - Contract Drilling Backlog\u201d for future commitments of our rigs during 2021 through 2024.\nContract Drilling Backlog\nContract drilling backlog, as presented below, includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue to be earned and the actual periods during which revenues will be earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 92-98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including weather conditions and unscheduled downtime for repairs and maintenance, as well as COVID-19 related delays. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function\nof the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. In addition, under certain circumstances, our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts, which could adversely affect our reported backlog.\nSee Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized\u201d in Item 1A of this report.\nThe backlog information presented below does not, nor is it intended to, align with the disclosures related to revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to unsatisfied performance obligations, which are presented in Note 3 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Contract drilling backlog includes only future dayrate revenue as described above, while the disclosure in Note 3 excludes dayrate revenue and only reflects expected future revenue for mobilization, demobilization and capital modifications to our rigs, which are related to non-distinct promises within our signed contracts.\nThe following table reflects our contract drilling backlog attributable to future operations as of January 1, 2021 (based on information available at that time), October 1, 2020 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020), and January 1, 2020 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019) (in millions).\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n2021(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 1,\n2020(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n2020(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract Drilling Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Contract drilling backlog as of January 1, 2021, October 1, 2020 and January 1, 2020 excludes future commitment amounts totaling approximately $75.0 million, $100.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, payable by a customer in the form of a guarantee of gross margin to be earned on future contracts or by direct payment, pursuant to terms of an existing contract.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reflects the amount of our contract drilling backlog by year as of January 1, 2021 (in millions).\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract Drilling Backlog (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Contract drilling backlog as of January 1, 2021 excludes future gross margin commitments totaling an aggregate of approximately $75.0 million for the three-year period ending December 31, 2023.

Our operating income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. The two most significant variables affecting our contract drilling revenue are the dayrates earned and utilization rates achieved by our rigs, each of which is a function of rig supply and\ndemand in the marketplace. These factors are not entirely within our control and are difficult to predict. We generally recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. Consequently, when a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result.\nRevenue is affected by the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. In connection with certain drilling contracts, we may receive fees for the mobilization and demobilization of equipment. In addition, some of our drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which we may or may not be compensated. We recognize these fees ratably as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization and contract preparation fees received (on either a lump-sum or dayrate basis), as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the mobilization of equipment and contract preparation activities, and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts. As noted above, demobilization revenue expected to be received upon contract completion is estimated and is also recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract.\nOperating income also fluctuates due to varying levels of contract drilling expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment, which generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and short-term reductions in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm-stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of our customer when a rig is under contract. However, if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rig's crew and take steps to cold stack\u201d the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The cost of cold stacking a rig can vary depending on the type of rig. The cost of cold stacking a drillship, for example, is typically substantially higher than the cost of cold stacking an older floater rig.\nThe principal components of our operating expenses include direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. In addition, the costs associated with training employees can be significant. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. See - Contractual Cash Obligations - Pressure Control by the Hour\u00ae.\u201d\nRestructuring Costs. During 2020, we incurred $60.9 million in incremental professional fees for attorneys, financial advisors and other professionals related to the consideration of restructuring alternatives, including the preparation for filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and related matters, and in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. We expect to incur incremental costs of approximately $70 million during 2021 for similar professionals and services. See - Results of Operations - Restructuring and Separation Costs\u201d and - Results of Operations - Reorganization items, net.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. The most immediate impact and risks to our business as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have been to the safety of our personnel, as well as travel restrictions that have challenged the ability to move personnel, equipment, supplies and service personnel to-and-from our drilling rigs. In some instances, we have asked our rig crews to quarantine in-country before offshore rotations, as well as to remain in country after their offshore rotation, resulting in incremental costs for salaries and other employee-related expenses such as meals and lodging. Our employee travel costs have also increased due to decreased passenger capacity on carriers, requiring additional trips to move personnel. In some cases, we incur freight surcharges to bring equipment and supplies to our rigs. We have also incurred additional costs to deep-clean facilities, for medical personnel and to purchase medical supplies and personal protective equipment.\nWith respect to protecting our crews and, thus, our rig operations, we have adopted COVID-19 testing requirements based on the regions in which our rigs are operating that primarily require testing of all personnel prior to an offshore rotation or travel from the U.S. to an international location. Additionally, for most of our rigs we have implemented the following health protocols once personnel are on board a rig:\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> 14-day isolation of our crew prior to reporting for crew change;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> decreased crew change frequency to minimize the frequency of travel and turnover of crew;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> twice daily temperature checks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> eliminated large group meetings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reduced seating capacity in galley for social distancing;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> eliminated self-servicing of food;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased frequency of disinfectant cleaning in communal areas on the rig; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reduced number of personnel in elevators to a maximum of four.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the Ocean Monarch was previously expected to commence drilling operations in Myanmar in late March 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions put in place by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the start of the drilling contract was delayed until December 2020. During the delay, the Ocean Monarch was warm stacked in Johor Bahru, Malaysia where it earned a standby rate intended to cover our daily operating costs while waiting to commence its contract. The Ocean Monarch commenced drilling operations in December 2020 and follows enhanced protocols intended to protect the health of the rig crew and prevent a shutdown of rig operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred incremental costs of approximately $12.5 million related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to incur similar types of costs during 2021 but cannot predict the future financial impact of our response to the pandemic nor its duration in this fluid environment. As such, costs may be more than projected, perhaps by a material amount.\nRegulatory Surveys and Planned Downtime. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a special survey, that are due every five years for most of our rigs. The inspection interval for our North Sea rigs is two-and-one-half years. Operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs, which are recognized as incurred. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a special survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.\nDuring 2021, we expect to spend approximately 325 days of planned downtime, including approximately an aggregate 155 days, 95 days and 55 days for mobilization and contract preparation activities for the Ocean BlackRhino, Ocean Courage and Ocean Onyx, respectively. We also expect to spend approximately 20 days for an intermediate survey for the Ocean Patriot in the first quarter of 2021. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with these or other projects. See - Contract Drilling Backlog.\u201d\nPhysical Damage and Marine Liability Insurance. We are self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under our current insurance policy, we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is $25.0 million per occurrence. We do not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover our rigs.\nIn addition, we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, and generally covering liabilities arising out of or relating to pollution and/or environmental risk. We believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business. Under these policies our deductibles for marine liability coverage related to insurable events arising due to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are $25.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $25.0 million and, if\naggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year. Our deductibles for other marine liability coverage, including personal injury claims not related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are $5.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year.\nImpact of Changes in Tax Laws or Their Interpretation. We operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world. As a result, we are subject to highly complex tax laws, treaties and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may change and are subject to interpretation. Changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and regulations may put us at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments that upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset, are capitalized. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $137.4 million and $343.8 million, respectively, in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet.\nWe evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (such as, but not limited to, cold stacking a rig, the expectation of cold stacking a rig in the near future, contracted backlog of less than one year for a rig, a decision to retire or scrap a rig, or excess spending over budget on a newbuild, construction project, reactivation or major rig upgrade). We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following:\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> dayrate by rig;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> utilization rate by rig if active, warm-stacked or cold-stacked (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used at certain dayrates);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the per day operating cost for each rig if active, warm-stacked or cold-stacked;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and/or enhancement programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the estimated maintenance, inspection or other reactivation costs associated with a rig returning to work;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> salvage value for each rig; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of each rig.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on these assumptions, we develop a matrix for each rig under evaluation using multiple utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of which we assign a probability of occurrence. We arrive at a projected probability-weighted cash flow for each rig based on the respective matrix and compare such amount to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability.\nThe underlying assumptions and assigned probabilities of occurrence for utilization and dayrate scenarios are developed using a methodology that examines historical data for each rig, which considers the rig's age, rated water depth and other attributes and then assesses its future marketability in light of the current and projected market environment at the time of assessment. Other assumptions, such as operating, maintenance, inspection and reactivation costs, are estimated using historical data adjusted for known developments, cost projections for re-entry of rigs into the market and future events that are anticipated by management at the time of the assessment.\nManagement's assumptions are necessarily subjective and are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation, and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Our methodology generally involves the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement, which may include assumptions related to future dayrate revenue, costs and rig utilization, quotes from rig brokers, the long-term future performance of our rigs and future market conditions. Management's assumptions involve uncertainties about future demand for our services, dayrates, expenses and other future events, and management's expectations may not be indicative of future outcomes. Significant unanticipated changes to these assumptions could materially alter our analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. For example, changes in market conditions that exist at the measurement date or that are projected by management could affect our key assumptions. Other events or circumstances that could affect our assumptions may include, but are not limited to, a further sustained decline in oil and gas prices, cancelations of our drilling contracts or contracts of our competitors, contract modifications, costs to comply with new governmental regulations, capital expenditures required due to advances in offshore drilling technology, growth in the global oversupply of oil and geopolitical events, such as lifting sanctions on oil-producing nations. Should actual market conditions in the future vary significantly from market conditions used in our projections, our assessment of impairment would likely be different.\nDuring 2020, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $842.0 million relating to four drilling rigs. We did not incur an impairment loss in 2019. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not\u201d approach. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards, utilization of foreign tax credits, and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit.\nIn several of the international locations in which we operate, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly-owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations. We apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the arm's length amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment and utilize outside consultants to assist us in the development of such transfer pricing methodologies. In most cases, there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and, if applied, could result in different chargeable amounts.\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results for contract drilling services are dependent on three primary metrics or key performance indicators: revenue-earning, or R-E, days, rig utilization and average daily revenue. The following table presents these three key performance indicators and other comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses (in thousands, except days, daily amounts and percentages).\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\n2020 Compared to 2019\nContract Drilling Revenue. Contract drilling revenue decreased $242.2 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average daily revenue earned ($138.3 million) and 381 fewer R-E days ($103.9 million). The decrease in average daily revenue was primarily due to both the Ocean BlackHornet and Ocean BlackLion starting new contracts in 2020 at significantly lower dayrates than the rigs' previous contracts and the Ocean Monarch earning a reduced standby rate during most of 2020 due to COVID-19 related delays. R-E days decreased, compared to 2019, primarily due to cold stacking the Ocean Valiant and Ocean GreatWhite (an aggregate 507 fewer R-E days)\nand incremental downtime attributable to the warm stacking of rigs between contracts (450 fewer R-E days), partially offset by incremental R-E days for the Ocean Endeavor (180 additional R-E days), which was reactivated for a new contract that commenced during the second quarter of 2019, less downtime for planned shipyard projects and mobilization of rigs (266 additional R-E days) and less unplanned downtime for rig repairs and maintenance (130 additional R-E days). The decline in revenues during 2020 was partially offset by revenue recognized during the first quarter of 2020 related to the reimbursement of withholding taxes related to one of our rigs in Brazil ($8.8 million).\nContract Drilling Expense, Excluding Depreciation. Contract drilling expense, excluding depreciation, decreased $174.9 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred contract preparation and mobilization costs ($73.2 million), primarily related to a 2019 contract in the U.K. for the Ocean GreatWhite and contract completions in 2020, combined with lower costs for repairs, maintenance and inspections ($45.6 million), labor and personnel ($21.3 million), equipment rentals ($6.6 million), the absence of a contingent loss reserve for a non-income tax assessment in 2019 ($7.1 million) and other decreased rig costs ($10.6 million). The overall reduction in rig operating expense during 2020 also reflected a reduction in shorebase and overhead costs related to restructuring efforts ($27.0 million) in 2020. These cost reductions were partially offset by an increase in other rig moving costs, including fuel ($16.5 million).\nDepreciation Expense. Depreciation expense for 2020 decreased $35.5 million compared to 2019. The net reduction in depreciation expense was primarily due to a lower depreciable asset base in 2020 as a result of asset impairments recognized during the first quarter of 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased $11.0 million during 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to reduced payroll costs associated with recent restructuring efforts ($3.5 million), lower travel costs due to COVID-19 related restrictions ($1.7 million) and a net decrease in other administrative costs ($5.8 million), including reduced costs associated with our services agreement with Loews Corporation, which was terminated on April 24, 2020.\nImpairment of Assets. During the first quarter of 2020, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of $774.0 million to write down four of our drilling rigs with indicators of impairment to their estimated fair values. We recognized an additional $68.0 million impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2020, to further write down the carrying value of one rig previously impaired during the first quarter of 2020 based on additional information regarding future opportunities for the rig. See Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d and Note 8 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRestructuring and Separation Costs. Prior to the Petition Date, we incurred $7.4 million in legal and other professional advisor fees in connection with the consideration of restructuring alternatives, including the preparation for filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and related matters. Also, during 2020, we initiated a plan to reduce the number of employees in our world-wide organization in an effort to restructure our business operations and reduce operating costs. As a result of this initiative, we incurred costs of $10.3 million during 2020, primarily for severance and related costs associated with a reduction in personnel in our corporate offices, warehouse facilities and certain of our international shorebase locations. See Note 14 Restructuring and Separation Costs\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense for 2020 decreased $80.2 million compared to 2019, primarily due to decreased interest recognized on our Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Facility in 2020 as compared to 2019. We ceased accruing interest expense on our senior unsecured debt and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement upon filing the Chapter 11 Cases on April 26, 2020. As a result, we did not record $76.7 million and $21.3 million of contractual interest expense related to our Senior Notes and borrowings drawn in 2020 under our Revolving Credit Agreement, respectively, for 2020. See Note 2 Chapter 11 Proceedings\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nReorganization Items, net. We recognized $76.9 million in expenses and other net losses directly related to the Chapter 11 Cases in 2020, primarily consisting of incremental professional fees ($53.5 million) incurred and the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with our Senior Notes ($27.6 million), partially offset by net gains related to vendor settlements and purchase order cancellations ($4.2 million). See Note 2 Chapter 11 Proceedings\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIncome Tax Benefit. We recorded a net income tax benefit of $21.2 million (1.7% effective tax rate) for 2020, compared to an income tax benefit of $44.8 million (11.1% effective tax rate) for 2019. The tax benefit for 2020 included a net tax benefit of $9.7 million due to a partial release of a previously recognized valuation allowance and tax rate change, as a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and allowed a carryback of net operating losses generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to each of the five preceding taxable years. Income tax benefit for 2019 included a net $14.2 million income tax benefit associated with the reduction in our estimate of our transition tax liability pursuant to final regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service in June 2019.\nOther than these discrete tax amounts, the reduction in the effective tax rate in 2020, compared to 2019, was in large part due to $842.0 million in impairment charges recognized in 2020, with no tax benefit, and incremental valuation allowances recorded in 2020 of $ 69.2 million, compared to $30.7 million in 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 1, 2021, our contractual backlog was $1.2 billion, of which $0.7 billion is expected to be realized in 2021. At December 31, 2020, we had cash available for current operations of $405.9 million.\nThe terms of the PSA entered into on January 22, 2021 stipulate that upon emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, the reorganized Company will enter into new exit financing facilities consisting of:\n(a) a $300.0 million to $400.0 million aggregate principal amount first lien, first out exit revolving credit facility (or Exit Revolving Credit Facility), plus a commitment fee of approximately $3.5 million payable in kind in the form of additional drawn commitments under the Exit Revolving Credit Facility, which shall increase both the amount of drawn and total commitments thereunder, in exchange for providing such new money commitments.;\n(b) a $100.0 million to $200.0 million aggregate principal amount first lien, last out exit term loan facility; and\n(c) $110.0 million aggregate principal amount in first lien, last out exit notes (or Exit Notes) plus $9.9 million aggregate principal amount of additional Exit Notes issued on account of the Commitment Premium (as defined in the Backstop Agreement) payable in kind in the form of additional Exit Notes..\nThe PSA contemplates that (i) the Exit Revolving Credit Facility will be fully committed, with up to $100.0 million drawn as of the Effective Date, as defined in the Plan included in the PSA, and (ii) $75.0 million of the Exit Notes will be issued and outstanding as of the Effective Date, excluding $9.9 million aggregate principal amount of additional Exit Notes issued on account of the Commitment Premium, while $35.0 million of the Exit Notes will remain fully committed but undrawn as of the Effective Date and will be available through a delayed draw mechanism pursuant to the terms of the Exit Notes.\nSee Note 18 Subsequent Event\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAlthough we anticipate that the financial restructuring pursuant to our Chapter 11 Cases will help address our liquidity concerns, uncertainty remains over the Bankruptcy Court's approval and our successful implementation of the Plan and therefore substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern at this time. Financial information in this report has been prepared on the basis that we will continue as a going concern, which presumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business as they come due. Financial information in this report does not reflect the adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported expenses and balance sheet classifications that would be necessary if we were unable to realize our assets and settle our liabilities as a going concern in the normal course of operations. Such adjustments could be material. Our long-term liquidity requirements, the adequacy of capital resources and ability to continue as a going concern are difficult to predict at this time and ultimately cannot be determined until the Plan, or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, has been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. If our future sources of liquidity are insufficient, we could face substantial liquidity constraints and could be unable to continue as a going concern and would likely be required to significantly reduce, delay or eliminate capital expenditures, implement further cost reductions, or seek other financing alternatives.\nOur worldwide cash balances are available to finance both our domestic and foreign activities. If and when circumstances require, we expect to record the withholding tax impact associated with the potential distribution of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries; however, we have not provided income tax on the outside basis difference of our international subsidiaries as management does not intend to dispose of these subsidiaries and structuring alternatives exist to mitigate any potential liability should a disposition take place.\nWe have historically invested a significant portion of our cash flows in the enhancement of our drilling fleet and our ongoing rig equipment replacement and capital maintenance programs. The amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments is determined by evaluating the need to upgrade our rigs to meet specific customer requirements and our rig equipment enhancement, maintenance and replacement programs. We make periodic assessments of our capital spending programs based on current and expected industry conditions and our cash flow forecast.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur operating activities provided net cash of $8.4 million in 2020. Our other sources of cash during the year were borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement ($436.0 million) and proceeds from the sales of the Ocean Confidence ($4.6 million), our corporate headquarters office building in Houston, Texas ($7.5 million) and Trinidad bonds ($5.9 million). See - Credit Agreements\u201d and Note 5 Supplemental Financial Information\u201d and Note 10 Credit Agreements and Senior Notes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nWe used cash aggregating $189.5 million for capital expenditures during 2020.\nCash Flow from Operations. Cash flow from operations in 2020 decreased $0.7 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower cash receipts for contract drilling services ($157.2 million), combined with collateral deposits made in support of certain outstanding surety and other bonds and letters of credit ($18.3 million). The reduction in operating cash inflows was partially offset by the favorable effects of lower net cash expenditures for contract drilling, shorebase support and general and administrative costs in 2020 compared to 2019 ($125.4 million) and the receipt of cash income tax refunds, net of payments ($30.6 million) in 2020 compared to net cash taxes paid ($18.8 million) in 2019.\nUpgrades and Other Capital Expenditures. As of the date of this report, we expect cash capital expenditures in 2021 to be approximately $120 million to $150 million. Planned spending in 2021 associated with projects under our capital maintenance and replacement programs includes equipment upgrades for the Ocean BlackRhino, Ocean BlackLion and Ocean Courage.\nCredit Agreements. Effective March 17, 2020, we terminated our $225.0 million revolving credit agreement, which was scheduled to mature on October 22, 2020. At the time of termination, there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility. We did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination and wrote off $0.5 million in deferred arrangement fees associated with the facility.\nIn March 2020, we borrowed $436.0 million under our $950.0 million senior 5-year Revolving Credit Agreement, which we entered into on October 2, 2018. The principal and interest under the Revolving Credit Agreement became immediately due and payable upon filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, which constituted an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors' rights of enforcement in respect of the Revolving Credit Agreement are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The outstanding borrowings and accrued interest have been presented as Liabilities subject to compromise\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020.\nAdditionally, as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we received notification on April 28, 2020 that the commitments under our Revolving Credit Agreement had been reduced from $950 million to approximately $442.0 million, representing the amount of borrowings outstanding plus the value of a $6.0 million financial letter of credit, which was issued in January 2020 under the Revolving Credit Agreement in support of a previously issued surety bond.\nSee Note 10 Credit Agreements and Senior Notes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nSenior Notes. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate $2.0 billion in Senior Notes outstanding with stated maturities at various times beginning in 2023 through 2043. The filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated the Company's obligations under our Senior Notes. As a result, the principal and accrued interest thereon are immediately due and payable and have been presented as Liabilities subject to compromise\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020. However, any efforts to enforce such payment obligations are automatically stayed as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, and the creditors' rights of enforcement in respect of the Senior Notes are subject to the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.\nSee Note 10 Credit Agreements and Senior Notes\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nCredit Ratings\nFollowing the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings lowered our credit ratings to default status. They subsequently withdrew our issued credit ratings and outlook and have discontinued their rating coverage of the Company.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2020 (in thousands).\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due By Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2022-2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2024-2025\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior notes (principal and interest) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,726,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 476,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 708,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,307,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit facility borrowings (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 466,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 466,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Well Control Equipment services agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,227\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,949\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,585,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 773,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 619,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 848,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,344,248\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The above table excludes $55.8 million of total net unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions that could result in a future cash payment as of December 31, 2020.

In 2016, we entered into a ten-year agreement with a subsidiary of Baker Hughes Company (formerly known as Baker Hughes, a GE company), or Baker Hughes, to provide services with respect to certain blowout preventer and related well control equipment, or Well Control Equipment, on our four drillships. Such services include management of maintenance, certification and reliability with respect to such equipment. In connection with the contractual services agreement, we sold the Well Control Equipment on our drillships to a Baker Hughes subsidiary and are leasing it back over separate ten-year operating leases for approximately $26 million per year in the aggregate. Collectively, we refer to the contractual services agreement and corresponding operating lease agreements with the Baker Hughes affiliate as the PCbtH program.\u201d See Note 11 Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d Note 12 Leases and Lease Commitments\u201d and Note 18 Subsequent Event\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nExcept for our contractual requirements under the PCbtH program discussed above, we had no other purchase obligations for major rig upgrades or any other significant obligations at December 31, 2020, except for those related to our direct rig operations, which arise during the normal course of business.\nOther Commercial Commitments - Letters of Credit\nWe were contingently liable as of December 31, 2020 in the amount of $32.5 million under certain tax, performance, supersedeas, VAT and customs bonds and letters of credit. Agreements relating to approximately $24.2 million of customs, tax, VAT and supersedeas bonds can require collateral at any time, while the remaining agreements, aggregating $8.3 million, cannot require collateral except in events of default. During the year ended December 31, 2020, a $6.0 million financial letter of credit was issued on our behalf as collateral in support of our outstanding surety bonds. The financial letter of credit was drawn on by the beneficiary in January 2021 and was converted to an adjusted base rate loan under our Revolving Credit Agreement.

See Risk Factors - Regulatory and Legal Risks - Significant portions of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. and involve additional risks not associated with U.S. domestic operations\u201d in Item 1A of this report.\nCurrency Risk. Some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations, resulting in foreign currency exposure. Currency environments in which we currently have or previously had significant business operations include Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and the U.K., creating exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\ncurrencies other than the U.S. dollar. These assets and liabilities are revalued based on currency exchange rates at the end of the reporting period.\nTo reduce our currency exchange risk, we may, if possible, arrange for a portion of our international contracts to be payable to us in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency, with the balance of the contract payable in U.S. dollars. The revaluation of liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar related to foreign income taxes, including deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions, is reported as a component of Income tax benefit\u201d in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWe or our representatives may, from time to time, either in this report, in periodic press releases or otherwise, make or incorporate by reference certain written or oral statements that are forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.

Our current fleet excludes the Ocean America and Ocean Rover, which we are actively marketing for sale. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRecent Developments\nSince the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have continued to operate our business as a debtor-in-possession\u201d under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Additionally, as a debtor-in-possession, certain of our activities are subject to review and approval by the Bankruptcy Court, including, among other things, the incurrence of secured indebtedness, material asset dispositions, and other transactions outside the ordinary course of business. There can be no guarantee that the Chapter 11 Cases will be completed successfully or in the time frame contemplated by the PSA. The Consenting Stakeholders and we made certain customary commitments to each other, including the Consenting Stakeholders committing to vote to approve the Plan.\nThrough the financial restructuring contemplated in the PSA and the Plan, we, the Debtors, expect to emerge from the Chapter 11 cases with a capital structure that we expect will position the Debtors for future success in the offshore drilling industry.\nThe risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, the defaults under our Debt Instruments, and the weak industry conditions impacting our business raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern.\nFor additional information concerning our Chapter 11 Cases, see - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases -\u201d in Item 1A of this report and Note 2 Chapter 11 Proceedings\u201d and Note 18 Subsequent Event\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report.\nMarket Overview\nThe offshore contract drilling market continues to be severely challenged by an oversupply of rigs and continued depressed commodity prices, leading to a continuation of the prolonged industry downturn, a reduction in the number of drilling projects being sanctioned and increased competition.\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak and resulting measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, including government-imposed lockdowns, restrictions and travel bans, contributed to a dramatic fall in demand for oil during 2020. The modest success of COVID-19 restrictions and mitigation protocols in slowing the spread of the virus and the recent development and ongoing distribution of vaccines to combat COVID-19 have resulted in the easing of lockdowns and restrictions in some areas, as well as a gradual increase in demand for oil. However, the increase in demand has been tempered by struggling economies in parts of the globe remaining in various stages of lockdown due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\nCommodity prices have risen modestly since the start of the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to an agreement reached by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing nations on oil\nproduction quotas. The production cuts agreed to in April 2020 were subject to a tapering plan that increased oil production at points during the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As of the date of this report, the price for Brent crude oil had risen to the $60-per-barrel range, buoyed by optimism resulting from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and a January 2021 agreement by Saudi Arabia to reduce oil production to partially offset an increase in Russian production. Despite the modest recovery in commodity price since the first quarter of 2020, some analysts expect downward pressure on oil prices to persist in 2021 due to continuing concerns related to COVID-19 and the uncertain longevity of oil production quotas. Some industry analysts also predict that oil demand recovery/growth will be slowed by increasing fuel efficiency standards and decarbonization efforts. As a result, depressed commodity prices could continue for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result of low commodity prices and uncertain global demand, many exploration and production companies, including some of our customers, made significant reductions in their capital spending programs in 2020, resulting in the early release of some offshore rigs from drilling programs or termination of contracts. Other drilling programs were paused or put on hold in response to the need for COVID-19 containment. Some industry analysts predict that capital spending programs in 2021 will remain flat or perhaps decline compared to 2020. Given the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors, many customers have elected to defer previously sanctioned offshore drilling projects, which negatively impacts utilization.\nAt the end of 2020, based on industry reports, global floater contracted utilization was approximately 60%, with 126 of 212 available rigs contracted. In addition, industry analysts report that 26 floater rigs remain on order, with no floater deliveries having occurred in 2020. Only two of the twelve rigs on order scheduled for delivery in 2021 have been contracted for future work. The remaining rigs on order, none of which are contracted for future work, are scheduled for delivery in 2022 and 2023. Industry analysts also estimate that available rig supply will increase in 2021 as more than 50 of the currently contracted floaters will complete their contracts during the year and be available, increasing competition. To manage supply and reduce expenses in an oversupplied and highly competitive market, drilling contractors retired 24 floaters during 2020 based on industry data. Additionally, during periods of rig oversupply, it is not uncommon for a drilling contractor to elect to forego upcoming special surveys of rigs rolling off contract with no future work, resulting in the cold stacking or ultimate retirement of a rig. Historically, the longer a drilling rig remains cold stacked, the cost of reactivation increases and the likelihood of reactivation decreases.\nDuring 2020, we recognized asset impairments aggregating $842.0 million to write down four semisubmersible rigs to their estimated fair values. If market fundamentals in the offshore oil and gas industry continue to deteriorate or a market recovery is further delayed, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. As of the date of this report, we have two cold-stacked semisubmersible rigs, one of which has not been previously impaired. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAs a result of the continuing protracted industry downturn and these challenges, we are continuing to actively seek ways to drive efficiency, reduce non-productive time and provide technical innovation to our customers. We expect these innovations and efficiencies to result in faster and safer drilling and completion of wells, leading to lower overall well costs to the benefit of our customers.\nSee - Contract Drilling Backlog\u201d for future commitments of our rigs during 2021 through 2024.\nContract Drilling Backlog\nContract drilling backlog, as presented below, includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue to be earned and the actual periods during which revenues will be earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 92-98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including weather conditions and unscheduled downtime for repairs and maintenance, as well as COVID-19 related delays. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function\nof the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. In addition, under certain circumstances, our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts, which could adversely affect our reported backlog.\nSee Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized\u201d in Item 1A of this report.\nThe backlog information presented below does not, nor is it intended to, align with the disclosures related to revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to unsatisfied performance obligations, which are presented in Note 3 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Contract drilling backlog includes only future dayrate revenue as described above, while the disclosure in Note 3 excludes dayrate revenue and only reflects expected future revenue for mobilization, demobilization and capital modifications to our rigs, which are related to non-distinct promises within our signed contracts.\nThe following table reflects our contract drilling backlog attributable to future operations as of January 1, 2021 (based on information available at that time), October 1, 2020 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020), and January 1, 2020 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019) (in millions).\n\n (1) Contract drilling backlog as of January 1, 2021, October 1, 2020 and January 1, 2020 excludes future commitment amounts totaling approximately $75.0 million, $100.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, payable by a customer in the form of a guarantee of gross margin to be earned on future contracts or by direct payment, pursuant to terms of an existing contract. \nThe following table reflects the amount of our contract drilling backlog by year as of January 1, 2021 (in millions).\n\n (1) Contract drilling backlog as of January 1, 2021 excludes future gross margin commitments totaling an aggregate of approximately $75.0 million for the three-year period ending December 31, 2023. Pursuant to terms of an existing contract, these amounts are payable by a customer in the form of a guarantee of gross margin to be earned on future contracts or by direct payment at the end of such period. \nThe following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of January 1, 2021. The percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts, as well as scheduled shipyard, survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet, to total available days (number of rigs, including cold-stacked rigs, multiplied by the number of days in a particular year).\n\n (1) As of January 1, 2021, includes approximately 325 rig days and 65 rig days currently known and scheduled for contract preparation, mobilization of rigs, surveys and extended repair and maintenance projects for the years 2021 and 2022, respectively. \nImportant Factors That May Impact Our Operating Results, Financial Condition or Cash Flows\nOperating Income. Our operating income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. The two most significant variables affecting our contract drilling revenue are the dayrates earned and utilization rates achieved by our rigs, each of which is a function of rig supply and\ndemand in the marketplace. These factors are not entirely within our control and are difficult to predict. We generally recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. Consequently, when a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result.\nRevenue is affected by the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. In connection with certain drilling contracts, we may receive fees for the mobilization and demobilization of equipment. In addition, some of our drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which we may or may not be compensated. We recognize these fees ratably as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization and contract preparation fees received (on either a lump-sum or dayrate basis), as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the mobilization of equipment and contract preparation activities, and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts. As noted above, demobilization revenue expected to be received upon contract completion is estimated and is also recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract.\nOperating income also fluctuates due to varying levels of contract drilling expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment, which generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and short-term reductions in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm-stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of our customer when a rig is under contract. However, if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rig's crew and take steps to cold stack\u201d the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The cost of cold stacking a rig can vary depending on the type of rig. The cost of cold stacking a drillship, for example, is typically substantially higher than the cost of cold stacking an older floater rig.\nThe principal components of our operating expenses include direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. In addition, the costs associated with training employees can be significant. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. See - Contractual Cash Obligations - Pressure Control by the Hour\u00ae.\u201d\nRestructuring Costs. During 2020, we incurred $60.9 million in incremental professional fees for attorneys, financial advisors and other professionals related to the consideration of restructuring alternatives, including the preparation for filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and related matters, and in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. We expect to incur incremental costs of approximately $70 million during 2021 for similar professionals and services. See - Results of Operations - Restructuring and Separation Costs\u201d and - Results of Operations - Reorganization items, net.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. The most immediate impact and risks to our business as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have been to the safety of our personnel, as well as travel restrictions that have challenged the ability to move personnel, equipment, supplies and service personnel to-and-from our drilling rigs. In some instances, we have asked our rig crews to quarantine in-country before offshore rotations, as well as to remain in country after their offshore rotation, resulting in incremental costs for salaries and other employee-related expenses such as meals and lodging. Our employee travel costs have also increased due to decreased passenger capacity on carriers, requiring additional trips to move personnel. In some cases, we incur freight surcharges to bring equipment and supplies to our rigs. We have also incurred additional costs to deep-clean facilities, for medical personnel and to purchase medical supplies and personal protective equipment.\nWith respect to protecting our crews and, thus, our rig operations, we have adopted COVID-19 testing requirements based on the regions in which our rigs are operating that primarily require testing of all personnel prior to an offshore rotation or travel from the U.S. to an international location. Additionally, for most of our rigs we have implemented the following health protocols once personnel are on board a rig:\n \u2022 14-day isolation of our crew prior to reporting for crew change; \n \u2022 decreased crew change frequency to minimize the frequency of travel and turnover of crew; \n \u2022 twice daily temperature checks; \n \u2022 eliminated large group meetings; \n \u2022 reduced seating capacity in galley for social distancing; \n \u2022 eliminated self-servicing of food; \n \u2022 increased frequency of disinfectant cleaning in communal areas on the rig; and \n \u2022 reduced number of personnel in elevators to a maximum of four. \nIn addition, the Ocean Monarch was previously expected to commence drilling operations in Myanmar in late March 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions put in place by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the start of the drilling contract was delayed until December 2020. During the delay, the Ocean Monarch was warm stacked in Johor Bahru, Malaysia where it earned a standby rate intended to cover our daily operating costs while waiting to commence its contract. The Ocean Monarch commenced drilling operations in December 2020 and follows enhanced protocols intended to protect the health of the rig crew and prevent a shutdown of rig operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred incremental costs of approximately $12.5 million related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to incur similar types of costs during 2021 but cannot predict the future financial impact of our response to the pandemic nor its duration in this fluid environment. As such, costs may be more than projected, perhaps by a material amount.\nRegulatory Surveys and Planned Downtime. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a special survey, that are due every five years for most of our rigs. The inspection interval for our North Sea rigs is two-and-one-half years. Operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs, which are recognized as incurred. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a special survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.\nDuring 2021, we expect to spend approximately 325 days of planned downtime, including approximately an aggregate 155 days, 95 days and 55 days for mobilization and contract preparation activities for the Ocean BlackRhino, Ocean Courage and Ocean Onyx, respectively. We also expect to spend approximately 20 days for an intermediate survey for the Ocean Patriot in the first quarter of 2021. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with these or other projects. See - Contract Drilling Backlog.\u201d\nPhysical Damage and Marine Liability Insurance. We are self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under our current insurance policy, we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is $25.0 million per occurrence. We do not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover our rigs.\nIn addition, we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, and generally covering liabilities arising out of or relating to pollution and/or environmental risk. We believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business. Under these policies our deductibles for marine liability coverage related to insurable events arising due to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are $25.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $25.0 million and, if\naggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year. Our deductibles for other marine liability coverage, including personal injury claims not related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are $5.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year.\nImpact of Changes in Tax Laws or Their Interpretation. We operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world. As a result, we are subject to highly complex tax laws, treaties and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may change and are subject to interpretation. Changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and regulations may put us at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments that upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset, are capitalized. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $137.4 million and $343.8 million, respectively, in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet.\nWe evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (such as, but not limited to, cold stacking a rig, the expectation of cold stacking a rig in the near future, contracted backlog of less than one year for a rig, a decision to retire or scrap a rig, or excess spending over budget on a newbuild, construction project, reactivation or major rig upgrade). We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following:\n \u2022 dayrate by rig; \n \u2022 utilization rate by rig if active, warm-stacked or cold-stacked (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used at certain dayrates); \n \u2022 the per day operating cost for each rig if active, warm-stacked or cold-stacked; \n \u2022 the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and/or enhancement programs; \n \u2022 the estimated maintenance, inspection or other reactivation costs associated with a rig returning to work; \n \u2022 salvage value for each rig; and \n \u2022 estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of each rig. \nBased on these assumptions, we develop a matrix for each rig under evaluation using multiple utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of which we assign a probability of occurrence. We arrive at a projected probability-weighted cash flow for each rig based on the respective matrix and compare such amount to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability.\nThe underlying assumptions and assigned probabilities of occurrence for utilization and dayrate scenarios are developed using a methodology that examines historical data for each rig, which considers the rig's age, rated water depth and other attributes and then assesses its future marketability in light of the current and projected market environment at the time of assessment. Other assumptions, such as operating, maintenance, inspection and reactivation costs, are estimated using historical data adjusted for known developments, cost projections for re-entry of rigs into the market and future events that are anticipated by management at the time of the assessment.\nManagement's assumptions are necessarily subjective and are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation, and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Our methodology generally involves the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement, which may include assumptions related to future dayrate revenue, costs and rig utilization, quotes from rig brokers, the long-term future performance of our rigs and future market conditions. Management's assumptions involve uncertainties about future demand for our services, dayrates, expenses and other future events, and management's expectations may not be indicative of future outcomes. Significant unanticipated changes to these assumptions could materially alter our analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. For example, changes in market conditions that exist at the measurement date or that are projected by management could affect our key assumptions. Other events or circumstances that could affect our assumptions may include, but are not limited to, a further sustained decline in oil and gas prices, cancelations of our drilling contracts or contracts of our competitors, contract modifications, costs to comply with new governmental regulations, capital expenditures required due to advances in offshore drilling technology, growth in the global oversupply of oil and geopolitical events, such as lifting sanctions on oil-producing nations. Should actual market conditions in the future vary significantly from market conditions used in our projections, our assessment of impairment would likely be different.\nDuring 2020, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $842.0 million relating to four drilling rigs. We did not incur an impairment loss in 2019. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not\u201d approach. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

However, the increase in demand has been tempered by struggling economies in parts of the globe remaining in various stages of lockdown due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\nCommodity prices have risen modestly since the start of the second quarter of 2020, primarily due to an agreement reached by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producing nations on oil\nproduction quotas. The production cuts agreed to in April 2020 were subject to a tapering plan that increased oil production at points during the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. As of the date of this report, the price for Brent crude oil had risen to the $60-per-barrel range, buoyed by optimism resulting from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and a January 2021 agreement by Saudi Arabia to reduce oil production to partially offset an increase in Russian production. Despite the modest recovery in commodity price since the first quarter of 2020, some analysts expect downward pressure on oil prices to persist in 2021 due to continuing concerns related to COVID-19 and the uncertain longevity of oil production quotas. Some industry analysts also predict that oil demand recovery/growth will be slowed by increasing fuel efficiency standards and decarbonization efforts. As a result, depressed commodity prices could continue for the foreseeable future.\nAs a result of low commodity prices and uncertain global demand, many exploration and production companies, including some of our customers, made significant reductions in their capital spending programs in 2020, resulting in the early release of some offshore rigs from drilling programs or termination of contracts. Other drilling programs were paused or put on hold in response to the need for COVID-19 containment. Some industry analysts predict that capital spending programs in 2021 will remain flat or perhaps decline compared to 2020. Given the continued uncertainty around COVID-19 and other macroeconomic factors, many customers have elected to defer previously sanctioned offshore drilling projects, which negatively impacts utilization.\nAt the end of 2020, based on industry reports, global floater contracted utilization was approximately 60%, with 126 of 212 available rigs contracted. In addition, industry analysts report that 26 floater rigs remain on order, with no floater deliveries having occurred in 2020. Only two of the twelve rigs on order scheduled for delivery in 2021 have been contracted for future work. The remaining rigs on order, none of which are contracted for future work, are scheduled for delivery in 2022 and 2023. Industry analysts also estimate that available rig supply will increase in 2021 as more than 50 of the currently contracted floaters will complete their contracts during the year and be available, increasing competition. To manage supply and reduce expenses in an oversupplied and highly competitive market, drilling contractors retired 24 floaters during 2020 based on industry data. Additionally, during periods of rig oversupply, it is not uncommon for a drilling contractor to elect to forego upcoming special surveys of rigs rolling off contract with no future work, resulting in the cold stacking or ultimate retirement of a rig. Historically, the longer a drilling rig remains cold stacked, the cost of reactivation increases and the likelihood of reactivation decreases.\nDuring 2020, we recognized asset impairments aggregating $842.0 million to write down four semisubmersible rigs to their estimated fair values. If market fundamentals in the offshore oil and gas industry continue to deteriorate or a market recovery is further delayed, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. As of the date of this report, we have two cold-stacked semisubmersible rigs, one of which has not been previously impaired. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAs a result of the continuing protracted industry downturn and these challenges, we are continuing to actively seek ways to drive efficiency, reduce non-productive time and provide technical innovation to our customers. We expect these innovations and efficiencies to result in faster and safer drilling and completion of wells, leading to lower overall well costs to the benefit of our customers.\nSee - Contract Drilling Backlog\u201d for future commitments of our rigs during 2021 through 2024.\nContract Drilling Backlog\nContract drilling backlog, as presented below, includes only firm commitments (typically represented by signed contracts) and is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period. Our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period (excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days); however, the amount of actual revenue to be earned and the actual periods during which revenues will be earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors. Utilization rates, which generally approach 92-98% during contracted periods, can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including weather conditions and unscheduled downtime for repairs and maintenance, as well as COVID-19 related delays. Contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation and customer reimbursables. No revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys. Changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are generally a function\nof the performance of work on term contracts, as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts. In addition, under certain circumstances, our customers may seek to terminate or renegotiate our contracts, which could adversely affect our reported backlog.\nSee Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Operations - We can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized\u201d in Item 1A of this report.\nThe backlog information presented below does not, nor is it intended to, align with the disclosures related to revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to unsatisfied performance obligations, which are presented in Note 3 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Contract drilling backlog includes only future dayrate revenue as described above, while the disclosure in Note 3 excludes dayrate revenue and only reflects expected future revenue for mobilization, demobilization and capital modifications to our rigs, which are related to non-distinct promises within our signed contracts.\nThe following table reflects our contract drilling backlog attributable to future operations as of January 1, 2021 (based on information available at that time), October 1, 2020 (the date reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020), and January 1, 2020 (the date reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019) (in millions).\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n2021(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> October 1,\n2020(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> January 1,\n2020(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract Drilling Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Contract drilling backlog as of January 1, 2021, October 1, 2020 and January 1, 2020 excludes future commitment amounts totaling approximately $75.0 million, $100.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, payable by a customer in the form of a guarantee of gross margin to be earned on future contracts or by direct payment, pursuant to terms of an existing contract. \nThe following table reflects the amount of our contract drilling backlog by year as of January 1, 2021 (in millions).\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Years Ending December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract Drilling Backlog (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Contract drilling backlog as of January 1, 2021 excludes future gross margin commitments totaling an aggregate of approximately $75.0 million for the three-year period ending December 31, 2023.

Our operating income is primarily a function of contract drilling revenue earned less contract drilling expenses incurred or recognized. The two most significant variables affecting our contract drilling revenue are the dayrates earned and utilization rates achieved by our rigs, each of which is a function of rig supply and\ndemand in the marketplace. These factors are not entirely within our control and are difficult to predict. We generally recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed. Consequently, when a rig is idle, no dayrate is earned and revenue will decrease as a result.\nRevenue is affected by the acquisition or disposal of rigs, rig mobilizations, required surveys and shipyard projects. In connection with certain drilling contracts, we may receive fees for the mobilization and demobilization of equipment. In addition, some of our drilling contracts require downtime before the start of the contract to prepare the rig to meet customer requirements for which we may or may not be compensated. We recognize these fees ratably as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts. We defer mobilization and contract preparation fees received (on either a lump-sum or dayrate basis), as well as direct and incremental costs associated with the mobilization of equipment and contract preparation activities, and amortize each, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the related drilling contracts. As noted above, demobilization revenue expected to be received upon contract completion is estimated and is also recognized ratably over the initial term of the contract.\nOperating income also fluctuates due to varying levels of contract drilling expenses. Our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment, which generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and short-term reductions in utilization. For instance, if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time, few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or warm-stacked state with a full crew. In addition, when a rig is idle, we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs, which are typically costs of our customer when a rig is under contract. However, if a rig is expected to be idle for an extended period of time, we may reduce the size of a rig's crew and take steps to cold stack\u201d the rig, which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income. The cost of cold stacking a rig can vary depending on the type of rig. The cost of cold stacking a drillship, for example, is typically substantially higher than the cost of cold stacking an older floater rig.\nThe principal components of our operating expenses include direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits, repairs and maintenance, freight, regulatory inspections, boat and helicopter rentals and insurance. Labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses. In general, our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels, rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate. In addition, the costs associated with training employees can be significant. Costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing, as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working. See - Contractual Cash Obligations - Pressure Control by the Hour\u00ae.\u201d\nRestructuring Costs. During 2020, we incurred $60.9 million in incremental professional fees for attorneys, financial advisors and other professionals related to the consideration of restructuring alternatives, including the preparation for filing of the Chapter 11 Cases and related matters, and in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. We expect to incur incremental costs of approximately $70 million during 2021 for similar professionals and services. See - Results of Operations - Restructuring and Separation Costs\u201d and - Results of Operations - Reorganization items, net.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. The most immediate impact and risks to our business as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have been to the safety of our personnel, as well as travel restrictions that have challenged the ability to move personnel, equipment, supplies and service personnel to-and-from our drilling rigs. In some instances, we have asked our rig crews to quarantine in-country before offshore rotations, as well as to remain in country after their offshore rotation, resulting in incremental costs for salaries and other employee-related expenses such as meals and lodging. Our employee travel costs have also increased due to decreased passenger capacity on carriers, requiring additional trips to move personnel. In some cases, we incur freight surcharges to bring equipment and supplies to our rigs. We have also incurred additional costs to deep-clean facilities, for medical personnel and to purchase medical supplies and personal protective equipment.\nWith respect to protecting our crews and, thus, our rig operations, we have adopted COVID-19 testing requirements based on the regions in which our rigs are operating that primarily require testing of all personnel prior to an offshore rotation or travel from the U.S. to an international location. Additionally, for most of our rigs we have implemented the following health protocols once personnel are on board a rig:\n \u2022 14-day isolation of our crew prior to reporting for crew change; \n \u2022 decreased crew change frequency to minimize the frequency of travel and turnover of crew; \n \u2022 twice daily temperature checks; \n \u2022 eliminated large group meetings; \n \u2022 reduced seating capacity in galley for social distancing; \n \u2022 eliminated self-servicing of food; \n \u2022 increased frequency of disinfectant cleaning in communal areas on the rig; and \n \u2022 reduced number of personnel in elevators to a maximum of four. \nIn addition, the Ocean Monarch was previously expected to commence drilling operations in Myanmar in late March 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions put in place by the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the start of the drilling contract was delayed until December 2020. During the delay, the Ocean Monarch was warm stacked in Johor Bahru, Malaysia where it earned a standby rate intended to cover our daily operating costs while waiting to commence its contract. The Ocean Monarch commenced drilling operations in December 2020 and follows enhanced protocols intended to protect the health of the rig crew and prevent a shutdown of rig operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred incremental costs of approximately $12.5 million related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect to incur similar types of costs during 2021 but cannot predict the future financial impact of our response to the pandemic nor its duration in this fluid environment. As such, costs may be more than projected, perhaps by a material amount.\nRegulatory Surveys and Planned Downtime. Our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a special survey, that are due every five years for most of our rigs. The inspection interval for our North Sea rigs is two-and-one-half years. Operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are generally performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs, which are recognized as incurred. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a special survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter.\nDuring 2021, we expect to spend approximately 325 days of planned downtime, including approximately an aggregate 155 days, 95 days and 55 days for mobilization and contract preparation activities for the Ocean BlackRhino, Ocean Courage and Ocean Onyx, respectively. We also expect to spend approximately 20 days for an intermediate survey for the Ocean Patriot in the first quarter of 2021. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime associated with these or other projects. See - Contract Drilling Backlog.\u201d\nPhysical Damage and Marine Liability Insurance. We are self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. If a named windstorm in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Under our current insurance policy, we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is $25.0 million per occurrence. We do not typically retain loss-of-hire insurance policies to cover our rigs.\nIn addition, we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities, including coverage for certain personal injury claims, and generally covering liabilities arising out of or relating to pollution and/or environmental risk. We believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business. Under these policies our deductibles for marine liability coverage related to insurable events arising due to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are $25.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $25.0 million and, if\naggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year. Our deductibles for other marine liability coverage, including personal injury claims not related to named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are $5.0 million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between $5.0 million and, if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds, up to $100.0 million for each subsequent occurrence, depending on the nature, severity and frequency of claims that might arise during the policy year.\nImpact of Changes in Tax Laws or Their Interpretation. We operate through our various subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions throughout the world. As a result, we are subject to highly complex tax laws, treaties and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may change and are subject to interpretation. Changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and regulations may put us at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are included in Note 1 General Information\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. Judgments, assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies. We believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. We carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments that upgrade or increase the functionality of our existing equipment and that significantly extend the useful life of an existing asset, are capitalized. Significant judgments, assumptions and estimates may be required in determining whether or not such replacements and betterments meet the criteria for capitalization and in determining useful lives and salvage values of such assets. Changes in these judgments, assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we capitalized $137.4 million and $343.8 million, respectively, in replacements and betterments of our drilling fleet.\nWe evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable (such as, but not limited to, cold stacking a rig, the expectation of cold stacking a rig in the near future, contracted backlog of less than one year for a rig, a decision to retire or scrap a rig, or excess spending over budget on a newbuild, construction project, reactivation or major rig upgrade). We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. Our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following:\n \u2022 dayrate by rig; \n \u2022 utilization rate by rig if active, warm-stacked or cold-stacked (expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used at certain dayrates); \n \u2022 the per day operating cost for each rig if active, warm-stacked or cold-stacked; \n \u2022 the estimated annual cost for rig replacements and/or enhancement programs; \n \u2022 the estimated maintenance, inspection or other reactivation costs associated with a rig returning to work; \n \u2022 salvage value for each rig; and \n \u2022 estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of each rig. \nBased on these assumptions, we develop a matrix for each rig under evaluation using multiple utilization/dayrate scenarios, to each of which we assign a probability of occurrence. We arrive at a projected probability-weighted cash flow for each rig based on the respective matrix and compare such amount to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability.\nThe underlying assumptions and assigned probabilities of occurrence for utilization and dayrate scenarios are developed using a methodology that examines historical data for each rig, which considers the rig's age, rated water depth and other attributes and then assesses its future marketability in light of the current and projected market environment at the time of assessment. Other assumptions, such as operating, maintenance, inspection and reactivation costs, are estimated using historical data adjusted for known developments, cost projections for re-entry of rigs into the market and future events that are anticipated by management at the time of the assessment.\nManagement's assumptions are necessarily subjective and are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation, and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported. Our methodology generally involves the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement, which may include assumptions related to future dayrate revenue, costs and rig utilization, quotes from rig brokers, the long-term future performance of our rigs and future market conditions. Management's assumptions involve uncertainties about future demand for our services, dayrates, expenses and other future events, and management's expectations may not be indicative of future outcomes. Significant unanticipated changes to these assumptions could materially alter our analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment. For example, changes in market conditions that exist at the measurement date or that are projected by management could affect our key assumptions. Other events or circumstances that could affect our assumptions may include, but are not limited to, a further sustained decline in oil and gas prices, cancelations of our drilling contracts or contracts of our competitors, contract modifications, costs to comply with new governmental regulations, capital expenditures required due to advances in offshore drilling technology, growth in the global oversupply of oil and geopolitical events, such as lifting sanctions on oil-producing nations. Should actual market conditions in the future vary significantly from market conditions used in our projections, our assessment of impairment would likely be different.\nDuring 2020, we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of $842.0 million relating to four drilling rigs. We did not incur an impairment loss in 2019. See - Results of Operations - Impairment of Assets\u201d and Note 4 Asset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nIncome Taxes. We account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. In each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if necessary, which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not\u201d approach. We make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate, the potential"}
