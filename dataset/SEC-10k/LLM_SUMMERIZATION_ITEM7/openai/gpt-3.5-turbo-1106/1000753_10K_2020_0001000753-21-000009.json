Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this annual report. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period.\nThe statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The actual results of the future events described in such forward-looking statements in this annual report could differ materially from those stated in such forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the risks and uncertainties discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and the uncertainties set forth from time to time in our other public reports and filings and public statements.\nExecutive Summary\nOverview\nOur long-term strategy is to provide the best small and medium-sized businesses in the United States with our specialized human resources service offering and to leverage our buying power and expertise to provide additional valuable services to clients. Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization\u00ae and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions), which encompass a broad range of human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers' compensation, government compliance, performance management and training and development services. Our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues, gross profit or adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month. We often use the average number of WSEEs paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer a comprehensive traditional payroll and human capital management solution, known as Workforce AccelerationTM. We also offer a number of other business performance solutions, including Comprehensive Traditional Payroll and Human Capital Management, Time and Attendance, Performance Management, Organizational Planning, Recruiting Services, Employment Screening, Retirement Services, and Insurance Services, many of which are offered as a cloud-based software solution. These other products or services are offered separately or with our other solutions.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, have resulted in a significant reduction in U.S. economic activity. As the duration of the pandemic and such economic impacts remain uncertain, we have planned for a range of scenarios and have modified certain business and workforce practices. To conform to government restrictions and best practices, we have taken steps designed to keep our staff safe while continuing to serve clients, including implementing remote working for all non-essential employees and providing extra safety measures at corporate facilities. To serve our clients, we have instituted a number of service offerings and developed COVID-19 resources to assist clients with obtaining government provided tax credits, tax deferrals, loans and loan forgiveness and to provide guidance to assist clients with addressing the challenges faced by employers as a result of the pandemic. These service offerings and guidance to assist clients during the pandemic included additional benefits support, remote workforce transition, monitoring and educating on regulatory changes, return to the workplace and workplace safety.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact to our first quarter 2020 financial results due to the increased spread of, and related government and business responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic not occurring until late in the quarter. However, towards the end of the first quarter, clients began layoffs and temporary leaves of absence of WSEEs, and this trend continued into the second quarter and resulted in a 1.8% decline in year-over-year average number of paid WSEEs per month in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, the number of WSEEs returning to work as well as new hires exceeded layoffs, resulting in a 1.7% sequential increase and a 3.8% year-over-year decline in the average number of paid WSEEs per month. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the average number of paid WSEEs declined 1.8% year-over-year and increased 3.2% sequentially as new client sales and rehires exceeded layoffs and client attrition. We expect overall reduced employment levels to have a negative impact on our 2021 financial results.\nWe experienced a 10.7% decrease in the year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during the second quarter of 2020, a 1.1% increase in the year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during the third quarter of 2020 and a\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>39\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2.4% increase in year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter 2020 increase in benefits costs per covered employee over the preceding third quarter of 2020 was due primarily to an increase in non-essential claims as a result of higher utilization and fewer deferrals or cancellations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the full year 2020, we experienced a 0.5% decrease in year-over-year benefits cost per covered employee. We currently expect to experience higher costs related to COVID-19 and certain non-essential elective healthcare procedures during 2021 that had been deferred in response to COVID-19 governmental requirements or guidance related to shelter in place and similar orders, as well as additional costs related to COVID-19 treatment and COBRA medical claims. As a result, we expect that our healthcare claim costs will not be reflective of our historical quarterly claim cost trends. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our accrued workers' compensation cost estimate; however, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our workers' compensation program remains uncertain. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to emerge, such impact, if any, on our workers' compensation program will be reflected in future reporting periods. In addition, during 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our state unemployment tax costs. However, we anticipate state unemployment tax rates will increase during 2021 and beyond due to the impact of increased unemployment claims. The majority of states have not provided 2021 unemployment tax rates to employers. Prior to the receipt of final rate notices, we estimate our expected state unemployment tax rates in those states for which rate notices have not yet been received for purposes of budgeting and pricing. Some states have indicated their intention to exclude pandemic related claims from employers' 2021 rates. However, the determination of which claims qualify for exclusion and the impact of such a determination on the 2021 state unemployment rates has not been clarified\nThe extent to which our future results are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the scope, duration and magnitude of the pandemic, actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, including programs designed to assist small and medium-sized businesses with the economic impact of the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including the development and availability of therapeutics and vaccines. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\n2020 Highlights\n\u2022Average number of WSEEs paid per month decreased 0.6% to 234,223, driving a 0.6% revenue decline.\n\u2022We ended 2020 averaging 239,232 paid WSEEs in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a 1.8% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect the average number of paid WSEEs per month to be between 232,100 and 234,400 in the first quarter 2021, which reflects the termination of a large client representing approximately 6,800 paid WSEEs.\n\u2022Approximately 24.4% and 25.7% of our average paid WSEEs were in our middle market sector for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 5,000 WSEEs.\n\u2022Gross profit increased $73.9 million, primarily due to lower healthcare utilization and lower workers' compensation costs.\n\u2022Net income and diluted earnings per share ( Diluted EPS\u201d) decreased 8.5% and 4.3% to $138.2 million and $3.54, respectively.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.4% to $288.6 million.\n\u2022Adjusted net income increased 7.0% to $181.3 million.\n\u2022Adjusted EPS increased 11.8% to $4.64.\n\u2022Our average gross profit per WSEE per month was $287 in 2020 and $259 in 2019.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased 12.1% in 2020 to $612.2 million, primarily due to increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and salaries and wages partially offset by lower travel costs. On a per WSEE per month basis, operating expenses increased from $193 in 2019 to $218 in 2020.\n\u2022Our adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month increased 17.0% from $88 in 2019 to $103 in 2020.\n\u2022We ended 2020 with working capital of $172.3 million.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>40\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022During 2020, we paid $61.9 million in dividends, repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $99.4 million, paid $98.2 million on capital expenditures, including $61.0 million for the construction of a new building, partially offset by borrowings of $100.0 million under our credit facility.\nPlease read Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating expenses to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated ( GAAP\u201d).\nRevenues\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each WSEE at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each WSEEs payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our WSEEs. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform their service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. Revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced represent unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of WSEEs paid each period and the number of WSEEs enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost, certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of WSEEs, which may fluctuate based on the composition of the WSEE base, inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets.\nDirect Costs\nThe primary direct costs associated with revenue-generating activities for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions are:\n\u2022employment-related taxes ( payroll taxes\u201d)\n\u2022costs of employee benefit plans\n\u2022workers' compensation costs\nPayroll taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes. Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal unemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state.\nEmployee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs (including dental and pharmacy costs), but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance, vision care, disability insurance, education assistance, adoption assistance, a flexible spending account program and a work-life program.\nWorkers' compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit per WSEE is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per WSEE per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022Salaries, wages and payroll taxes - Salaries, wages and payroll taxes ( Salaries\u201d) are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional cash incentive compensation.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>41\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur corporate employees include client services, sales and marketing, benefits, legal, finance, information technology, administrative support personnel and those associated with our other products and services.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation - Our stock-based compensation relates to the recognition of non-cash compensation expense over the requisite service period of time-vested and performance-based incentive plan awards.\n\u2022Commissions - Commissions expense consists primarily of amounts paid to sales managers and other sales personnel, including BPAs as well as channel referral fees. Commissions are based on new accounts sold and a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel.\n\u2022Advertising - Advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets, including the Insperity Invitational\u2122 presented by UnitedHealthcare\u00ae sponsorship.\n\u2022General and administrative expenses - Our general and administrative expenses primarily include:\n\u25e6rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices\n\u25e6outside professional service fees related to legal, consulting, and accounting services\n\u25e6administrative costs, such as postage, printing, and supplies\n\u25e6employee travel and training expenses\n\u25e6technology expenses\n\u25e6facility repairs and maintenance costs\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities, service centers, sales offices, software development and technology infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) includes interest charges incurred in connection with borrowings under our credit facility and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and deposits. Please read -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, due primarily to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, vesting of equity awards and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets, accruals for workers' compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, accrued incentive compensation, operating lease assets and liabilities and depreciation. Changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial statements, Income Taxes,\u201d for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>42\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\u2022Benefits costs - We provide group health insurance coverage to our WSEEs through a national network of carriers including United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.\nThe health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs\u201d), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (1) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (2) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (3) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we entered into an arrangement whereby our financial responsibility is limited to the first $1 million of paid claims per claimant per year. Additionally, since the plan's inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement with United require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of $9.0 million, which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance. As of December 31, 2020, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums paid and owed to United by $6.0 million. As this amount is less than the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level, the $15.0 million difference is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2020, were $11.7 million, which is also included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe believe that recent claim development patterns are representative of incurred but not reported claims costs during the reporting period. The estimated completion rate used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or increase) accordingly.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate on our estimate of total benefits costs of $2.0 billion in 2020:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in\nCompletion Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in\nBenefits Costs\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change in\nNet Income\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,572) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,829) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,717) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>19,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,293) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Workers' compensation costs - Since 2007, our workers' compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program for claims incurred on or before September 30, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1.5 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>43\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers' compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers' compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of WSEEs' job responsibilities, the location of WSEEs, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reduced accrued workers' compensation costs by $42.1 million and $31.7 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers' compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 0.6% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2019) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates, in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers' compensation costs in the period such determination is made. If we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or decrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers' compensation costs and a resulting decrease (or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers' compensation costs totaling $65.8 million in 2020:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Loss Development Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in Workers' Compensation Costs\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change in\nNet Income\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,165) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,082) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,520) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>4,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,040) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers' compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated WSEE payroll levels and expected workers' compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2020, we received $28.2 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $45.5 million and deposits of $186.3 million. We have estimated and accrued $240.8 million in incurred workers' compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2020. Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year is recorded as accrued workers' compensation costs and is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\u2022Contingent liabilities - We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined. From time to time, we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>44\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Allowance for doubtful accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees. We believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons, including:\n\u2022the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and WSEE payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees\n\u2022the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process\n\u2022the periodic and recurring nature of payroll, upon which the comprehensive service fees are based\nTo mitigate this risk, we have established very tight credit policies. We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than the same day as the applicable payroll date. In addition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated WSEEs or to require prepayment, letters of credit or other collateral if a client's financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues. However, if our clients' financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

paid is affected by three primary sources: new client sales, client retention and the net change in existing clients through WSEE new hires and terminations.\n\u2022During 2020, the average number of WSEEs paid from new client sales decreased 1.5% from 2019. The net gain (loss) in our client base declined compared to 2019 as we have seen layoffs and furloughs exceeding WSEEs returning to work or otherwise hired. We have also seen certain clients hire significant numbers of WSEEs, while others have experienced significant layoffs. Average client retention declined from 85% in 2019 to 82% in 2020.\n\u2022During 2019, while the average number of WSEEs paid increased 12.6%, the number of WSEEs paid from new client sales decreased over 2018. In addition, the net change in existing clients and client retention also decreased compared to 2018.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nOur revenues for 2020 were $4.3 billion, a decrease of 0.6%, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Average WSEEs paid decreased 0.6%.\n\u2022Revenues per WSEE per month was essentially flat with only a decrease of 0.1%, or $2, as 3.0% higher average pricing was partially offset by $121.3 million, or $43 per WSEE per month, in FICA deferral elections by clients and credits pursuant to the CARES Act and the FFCRA. These deferral elections also reduced our direct costs and\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>47\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\ntherefore had no net effect on our gross profit. In addition, during the second quarter of 2020, we reduced revenue by $11.6 million for client comprehensive service fee credits applied generally on a WSEE basis across our active client base to assist clients in addressing the unprecedented economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nOur revenues for 2019 were $4.3 billion, an increase of 12.7%, primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Average WSEEs paid increased 12.6%\n\u2022Revenues per WSEE per month increased 0.1%, or $1\nWe provide our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in strategically selected markets throughout the United States.

As a result, our gross profit per WSEE and our operating results are significantly impacted by our ability to accurately estimate, control and manage our direct costs relative to the revenues derived from the markup component of our gross billings.\nOur gross billings charged to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per WSEE per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nOur pricing objectives attempt to achieve a level of revenue per WSEE that matches or exceeds changes in primary direct costs and operating expenses. Our revenues per WSEE per month decreased $2 due to higher average pricing, which was offset by client FICA deferral elections and tax credits pursuant to the CARES Act and FFCRA in 2020. Our direct costs per WSEE per month decreased $30 due primarily to changes in our direct costs components as described below.\nThe net decrease in direct costs between 2020 and 2019 attributable to changes in cost estimates for benefits and workers' compensation totaled $12.9 million as discussed below. The primary direct cost components changed as follows:\nBenefits costs\n\u2022The cost of group health insurance and related employee benefits increased $11 per WSEE per month, but decreased 0.5% on a per covered employee basis due primarily to a decrease in claims as a result of lower utilization and the deferral of nonessential healthcare procedures in response to COVID-19 governmental requirements or guidance.\n\u2022The percentage of WSEEs covered under our health insurance plan was 67.9% in 2020 and 66.5% in 2019.\n\u2022Reported results include changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods, which was a decrease in costs of $0.2 million, but remained flat on a per WSEE per month basis, in 2020 compared to an increase in costs of $2.3 million, or $1 per WSEE per month, in 2019.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>49\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPlease read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for health insurance costs.\nWorkers' compensation costs\nOur continued discipline around our client selection, safety and claims management contributed to the reduction in our cost per WSEE and, as a result, has allowed for claims within our policy periods to be closed out at amounts below our original costs estimates.\n\u2022Workers' compensation costs decreased 19.7%, or $6 per WSEE per month, in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\u2022As a percentage of non-bonus payroll cost, workers' compensation costs in 2020 were 0.32% compared to 0.41% in 2019.\n\u2022As a result of closing out claims incurred in prior periods at lower than expected costs, we recorded a reduction in workers' compensation costs of $42.1 million, or 0.20% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2020 compared to a reduction of $31.7 million, or 0.16% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2019.

In addition, IRS tax reporting changes in 2020 eliminated PEO reporting of payroll taxes for self-employed owners. These reductions were partially offset by a 4.3% increase in payroll costs.\n\u2022Payroll taxes as a percentage of payroll cost were 6.0% in 2020 and 6.7% in 2019.\n2019 Compared to 2018\nThe net decrease in direct costs between 2019 and 2018 attributable to changes in cost estimates for benefits and workers' compensation totaled $9.3 million as discussed below. The primary direct cost components changed as follows:\nBenefits costs\n\u2022The cost of group health insurance and related employee benefits increased $12 per WSEE per month, or 4.0%, on a per covered employee basis due primarily to an increase in the number of large individual healthcare claimants in 2019.\n\u2022The percentage of WSEEs covered under our health insurance plan was 66.5% in 2019 and 68.0% in 2018.\n\u2022Reported results include changes in estimated claims run-off related to prior periods, which was an increase in costs of $2.3 million, or $1 per WSEE per month, in 2019 compared to a decrease in costs of $1.3 million, or $1 per WSEE per month, in 2018.\nPlease read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs\u201d for a discussion of our accounting for health insurance costs.\nWorkers' compensation costs\nOur continued discipline around our client selection, safety and claims management contributed to the reduction in our cost per WSEE and, as a result, has allowed for claims within our policy periods to be closed out at amounts below our original costs estimates.\n\u2022Workers' compensation costs decreased 4.7%, or $5 per WSEE per month, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>50\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022As a percentage of non-bonus payroll cost, workers' compensation costs in 2019 were 0.41% compared to 0.49% in 2018.\n\u2022As a result of closing out claims incurred in prior periods at lower than expected costs, we recorded a reduction in workers' compensation costs of $31.7 million, or 0.16% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2019 compared to a reduction of $18.8 million, or 0.11% of non-bonus payroll costs, in 2018.

2017 as a stock dividend.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of, among other things, our expansion plans, stock repurchases, potential acquisitions, debt service requirements and other operating cash needs. To meet short-term liquidity requirements, which are primarily the payment of direct costs and operating expenses, we rely primarily on cash from operations. Longer-term projects, large stock repurchases or significant acquisitions may be financed with debt or equity. We have a $500 million credit facility ( Facility\u201d) with a syndicate of financial institutions. The Facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and stock repurchases. We have in the past sought, and may in the future seek, to raise additional capital or take other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources.\nWe had $589.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2020, of which approximately $342.0 million was payable in early January 2021 for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, and $35.3 million were client prepayments that were payable in January 2021. During 2020, we borrowed $100.0 million under the Facility, which increased working capital. At December 31, 2020, we had working capital of $172.3 million compared to $105.7 million at December 31, 2019. The increase in working capital reflects, in part, cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Facility, offset by share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We currently believe that our cash on hand, marketable securities, cash flows from operations and availability under our Facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity requirements for 2021. We intend to rely on these same sources, as well as public and private debt or equity financing, to meet our longer-term liquidity and capital needs, which we are monitoring in light of the significant uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit and borrowings totaling $370.4 million under the Facility. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur net cash flows from operating activities in 2020 were $346.4 million. Our primary source of cash from operations is the comprehensive service fee and payroll funding we collect from our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients. Cash and cash equivalents, and thus our reported cash flows from operating activities, are significantly impacted by various external and internal factors, which are reflected in part by the changes in our balance sheet accounts. These include the following:\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>57\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Timing of client payments / payroll taxes - We typically collect our comprehensive service fee, along with the client's payroll funding, from clients no later than the same day as the payment of WSEE payrolls and associated payroll taxes. Therefore, the last business day of a reporting period has a substantial impact on our reporting of operating cash flows. For example, many WSEEs are paid on Fridays and at month-end; therefore, operating cash flows decrease in the reporting periods that end on a Friday. In the year ended December 31, 2020, the last business day of the reporting period ended on a Thursday, client prepayments were $35.3 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $342.0 million. In the period ended December 31, 2019, which ended on a Tuesday, client prepayments were $59.6 million and amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and other payroll deductions was $234.6 million.\n\u2022Workers' compensation plan funding - In 2020 and 2019, we received $28.2 million and $18.8 million, respectively, for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which resulted in an increase in working capital.\n\u2022Medical plan funding - Our health care contract with United establishes participant cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. Therefore, changes in the participation level of the United plan have a direct impact on our operating cash flows. In addition, changes to the funding rates, which are determined solely by United based primarily upon recent claim history and anticipated cost trends, also have a significant impact on our operating cash flows. As of December 31, 2020, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums paid and owed to United by $6.0 million, which is $15.0 million less than our agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level. The $15.0 million difference is therefore reflected as a current liability and $9.0 million is reflected as a long-term asset on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2020, were $11.7 million, which is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\u2022Operating results - Our adjusted net income has a significant impact on our operating cash flows. Our adjusted net income increased 7.0% to $181.3 million in 2020 from $169.4 million in 2019. Please read Results of Operations.\u201d\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur net cash flows used in investing activities were $98.6 million during 2020, primarily due to $98.2 million in property and equipment purchases, which included $61.0 million related to our corporate office expansion.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur net cash flows used in financing activities were $53.6 million during 2020. We repurchased $99.4 million in stock and paid $61.9 million in dividends, offset by borrowings of $100.0 million under our Facility. Please read Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information.\nSeasonality, Inflation and Quarterly Fluctuations\nOur quarterly earnings are impacted by the seasonal nature of our medical claims costs and payroll taxes. Typically, medical claims costs tend to increase throughout the year with the fourth quarter being the period with the highest costs, which has a negative impact on our fourth quarter earnings. This trend is primarily the result of many WSEEs' medical plan deductibles being fully met by the fourth quarter, which increases our liability with respect to those claims. We have also experienced variability on a quarterly basis in medical claims costs based on the unpredictable nature of large claims and the COVID-19 pandemic effect on healthcare utilization patterns. Payroll taxes and associated billings are computed based on an employee's annual taxable wage base. The annual payroll tax wage bases are frequently met in the first two quarters of each year depending on the employee's compensation levels. As a result, the gross profit contribution from payroll taxes is typically higher in the first two quarters and declines in the latter half of each year. These historical trends may change and other seasonal trends may develop in the future. For further information related to our health insurance costs, please read -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs.\u201d\nWe believe the effects of inflation have not had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>58\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "summary": "The report discusses the company's strategy to provide human resources services to small and medium-sized businesses and its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our most comprehensive HR services offerings are provided through our Workforce Optimization\u00ae and Workforce SynchronizationTM solutions (together, our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions), which encompass a broad range of human resources functions, including payroll and employment administration, employee benefits, workers' compensation, government compliance, performance management and training and development services. Our overall operating results can be measured in terms of revenues, gross profit or adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month. We often use the average number of WSEEs paid during a period as our unit of measurement in analyzing and discussing our results of operations.\nIn addition to our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, we offer a comprehensive traditional payroll and human capital management solution, known as Workforce AccelerationTM. We also offer a number of other business performance solutions, including Comprehensive Traditional Payroll and Human Capital Management, Time and Attendance, Performance Management, Organizational Planning, Recruiting Services, Employment Screening, Retirement Services, and Insurance Services, many of which are offered as a cloud-based software solution. These other products or services are offered separately or with our other solutions.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, have resulted in a significant reduction in U.S. economic activity. As the duration of the pandemic and such economic impacts remain uncertain, we have planned for a range of scenarios and have modified certain business and workforce practices. To conform to government restrictions and best practices, we have taken steps designed to keep our staff safe while continuing to serve clients, including implementing remote working for all non-essential employees and providing extra safety measures at corporate facilities. To serve our clients, we have instituted a number of service offerings and developed COVID-19 resources to assist clients with obtaining government provided tax credits, tax deferrals, loans and loan forgiveness and to provide guidance to assist clients with addressing the challenges faced by employers as a result of the pandemic. These service offerings and guidance to assist clients during the pandemic included additional benefits support, remote workforce transition, monitoring and educating on regulatory changes, return to the workplace and workplace safety.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic did not have a significant impact to our first quarter 2020 financial results due to the increased spread of, and related government and business responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic not occurring until late in the quarter. However, towards the end of the first quarter, clients began layoffs and temporary leaves of absence of WSEEs, and this trend continued into the second quarter and resulted in a 1.8% decline in year-over-year average number of paid WSEEs per month in the second quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, the number of WSEEs returning to work as well as new hires exceeded layoffs, resulting in a 1.7% sequential increase and a 3.8% year-over-year decline in the average number of paid WSEEs per month. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the average number of paid WSEEs declined 1.8% year-over-year and increased 3.2% sequentially as new client sales and rehires exceeded layoffs and client attrition. We expect overall reduced employment levels to have a negative impact on our 2021 financial results.\nWe experienced a 10.7% decrease in the year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during the second quarter of 2020, a 1.1% increase in the year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during the third quarter of 2020 and a\n\n\n2.4% increase in year-over-year benefits costs per covered employee during the fourth quarter of 2020. The fourth quarter 2020 increase in benefits costs per covered employee over the preceding third quarter of 2020 was due primarily to an increase in non-essential claims as a result of higher utilization and fewer deferrals or cancellations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the full year 2020, we experienced a 0.5% decrease in year-over-year benefits cost per covered employee. We currently expect to experience higher costs related to COVID-19 and certain non-essential elective healthcare procedures during 2021 that had been deferred in response to COVID-19 governmental requirements or guidance related to shelter in place and similar orders, as well as additional costs related to COVID-19 treatment and COBRA medical claims. As a result, we expect that our healthcare claim costs will not be reflective of our historical quarterly claim cost trends. The COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our accrued workers' compensation cost estimate; however, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our workers' compensation program remains uncertain. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to emerge, such impact, if any, on our workers' compensation program will be reflected in future reporting periods. In addition, during 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on our state unemployment tax costs. However, we anticipate state unemployment tax rates will increase during 2021 and beyond due to the impact of increased unemployment claims. The majority of states have not provided 2021 unemployment tax rates to employers. Prior to the receipt of final rate notices, we estimate our expected state unemployment tax rates in those states for which rate notices have not yet been received for purposes of budgeting and pricing. Some states have indicated their intention to exclude pandemic related claims from employers' 2021 rates. However, the determination of which claims qualify for exclusion and the impact of such a determination on the 2021 state unemployment rates has not been clarified\nThe extent to which our future results are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the scope, duration and magnitude of the pandemic, actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, including programs designed to assist small and medium-sized businesses with the economic impact of the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including the development and availability of therapeutics and vaccines. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\n2020 Highlights\n\u2022Average number of WSEEs paid per month decreased 0.6% to 234,223, driving a 0.6% revenue decline.\n\u2022We ended 2020 averaging 239,232 paid WSEEs in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a 1.8% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect the average number of paid WSEEs per month to be between 232,100 and 234,400 in the first quarter 2021, which reflects the termination of a large client representing approximately 6,800 paid WSEEs.\n\u2022Approximately 24.4% and 25.7% of our average paid WSEEs were in our middle market sector for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 5,000 WSEEs.\n\u2022Gross profit increased $73.9 million, primarily due to lower healthcare utilization and lower workers' compensation costs.\n\u2022Net income and diluted earnings per share ( Diluted EPS\u201d) decreased 8.5% and 4.3% to $138.2 million and $3.54, respectively.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.4% to $288.6 million.\n\u2022Adjusted net income increased 7.0% to $181.3 million.\n\u2022Adjusted EPS increased 11.8% to $4.64.\n\u2022Our average gross profit per WSEE per month was $287 in 2020 and $259 in 2019.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased 12.1% in 2020 to $612.2 million, primarily due to increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and salaries and wages partially offset by lower travel costs. On a per WSEE per month basis, operating expenses increased from $193 in 2019 to $218 in 2020.\n\u2022Our adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month increased 17.0% from $88 in 2019 to $103 in 2020.\n\u2022We ended 2020 with working capital of $172.3 million.\n\n\n\u2022During 2020, we paid $61.9 million in dividends, repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $99.4 million, paid $98.2 million on capital expenditures, including $61.0 million for the construction of a new building, partially offset by borrowings of $100.0 million under our credit facility.\nPlease read Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating expenses to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated ( GAAP\u201d).\nRevenues\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each WSEE at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each WSEEs payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our WSEEs. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform their service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. Revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced represent unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of WSEEs paid each period and the number of WSEEs enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost, certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of WSEEs, which may fluctuate based on the composition of the WSEE base, inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets.\nDirect Costs\nThe primary direct costs associated with revenue-generating activities for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions are:\n\u2022employment-related taxes ( payroll taxes\u201d)\n\u2022costs of employee benefit plans\n\u2022workers' compensation costs\nPayroll taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes. Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal unemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state.\nEmployee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs (including dental and pharmacy costs), but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance, vision care, disability insurance, education assistance, adoption assistance, a flexible spending account program and a work-life program.\nWorkers' compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit per WSEE is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per WSEE per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022Salaries, wages and payroll taxes - Salaries, wages and payroll taxes ( Salaries\u201d) are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional cash incentive compensation.\n\n\nOur corporate employees include client services, sales and marketing, benefits, legal, finance, information technology, administrative support personnel and those associated with our other products and services.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation - Our stock-based compensation relates to the recognition of non-cash compensation expense over the requisite service period of time-vested and performance-based incentive plan awards.\n\u2022Commissions - Commissions expense consists primarily of amounts paid to sales managers and other sales personnel, including BPAs as well as channel referral fees. Commissions are based on new accounts sold and a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel.\n\u2022Advertising - Advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets, including the Insperity Invitational\u2122 presented by UnitedHealthcare\u00ae sponsorship.\n\u2022General and administrative expenses - Our general and administrative expenses primarily include:\n\u25e6rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices\n\u25e6outside professional service fees related to legal, consulting, and accounting services\n\u25e6administrative costs, such as postage, printing, and supplies\n\u25e6employee travel and training expenses\n\u25e6technology expenses\n\u25e6facility repairs and maintenance costs\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities, service centers, sales offices, software development and technology infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) includes interest charges incurred in connection with borrowings under our credit facility and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and deposits. Please read -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, due primarily to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, vesting of equity awards and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets, accruals for workers' compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, accrued incentive compensation, operating lease assets and liabilities and depreciation. Changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial statements, Income Taxes,\u201d for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\u2022Benefits costs - We provide group health insurance coverage to our WSEEs through a national network of carriers including United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.\nThe health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs\u201d), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (1) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (2) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (3) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we entered into an arrangement whereby our financial responsibility is limited to the first $1 million of paid claims per claimant per year. Additionally, since the plan's inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement with United require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of $9.0 million, which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance. As of December 31, 2020, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums paid and owed to United by $6.0 million. As this amount is less than the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level, the $15.0 million difference is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2020, were $11.7 million, which is also included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe believe that recent claim development patterns are representative of incurred but not reported claims costs during the reporting period. The estimated completion rate used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or increase) accordingly.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate on our estimate of total benefits costs of $2.0 billion in 2020:\n\n\u2022Workers' compensation costs - Since 2007, our workers' compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program for claims incurred on or before September 30, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1.5 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million.\n\n\nBecause we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers' compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers' compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of WSEEs' job responsibilities, the location of WSEEs, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reduced accrued workers' compensation costs by $42.1 million and $31.7 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers' compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 0.6% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2019) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates, in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers' compensation costs in the period such determination is made. If we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or decrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers' compensation costs and a resulting decrease (or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers' compensation costs totaling $65.8 million in 2020:\n\nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers' compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated WSEE payroll levels and expected workers' compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2020, we received $28.2 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $45.5 million and deposits of $186.3 million. We have estimated and accrued $240.8 million in incurred workers' compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2020. Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year is recorded as accrued workers' compensation costs and is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\u2022Contingent liabilities - We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined. From time to time, we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made.\n\n\n\u2022Allowance for doubtful accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees. We believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons, including:\n\u2022the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and WSEE payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees\n\u2022the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process\n\u2022the periodic and recurring nature of payroll, upon which the comprehensive service fees are based\nTo mitigate this risk, we have established very tight credit policies. We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than the same day as the applicable payroll date. In addition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated WSEEs or to require prepayment, letters of credit or other collateral if a client's financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues. However, if our clients' financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\n\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our key financial and statistical information related to our results of operations:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\n2020 Highlights\n\u2022Average number of WSEEs paid per month decreased 0.6% to 234,223, driving a 0.6% revenue decline.\n\u2022We ended 2020 averaging 239,232 paid WSEEs in the fourth quarter of 2020, which represents a 1.8% decrease over the fourth quarter of 2019. We expect the average number of paid WSEEs per month to be between 232,100 and 234,400 in the first quarter 2021, which reflects the termination of a large client representing approximately 6,800 paid WSEEs.\n\u2022Approximately 24.4% and 25.7% of our average paid WSEEs were in our middle market sector for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is generally defined as companies with 150 to 5,000 WSEEs.\n\u2022Gross profit increased $73.9 million, primarily due to lower healthcare utilization and lower workers' compensation costs.\n\u2022Net income and diluted earnings per share ( Diluted EPS\u201d) decreased 8.5% and 4.3% to $138.2 million and $3.54, respectively.\n\u2022Adjusted EBITDA increased 15.4% to $288.6 million.\n\u2022Adjusted net income increased 7.0% to $181.3 million.\n\u2022Adjusted EPS increased 11.8% to $4.64.\n\u2022Our average gross profit per WSEE per month was $287 in 2020 and $259 in 2019.\n\u2022Operating expenses increased 12.1% in 2020 to $612.2 million, primarily due to increased non-cash stock-based compensation expense and salaries and wages partially offset by lower travel costs. On a per WSEE per month basis, operating expenses increased from $193 in 2019 to $218 in 2020.\n\u2022Our adjusted EBITDA per WSEE per month increased 17.0% from $88 in 2019 to $103 in 2020.\n\u2022We ended 2020 with working capital of $172.3 million.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>40\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022During 2020, we paid $61.9 million in dividends, repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $99.4 million, paid $98.2 million on capital expenditures, including $61.0 million for the construction of a new building, partially offset by borrowings of $100.0 million under our credit facility.\nPlease read Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating expenses to their most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated ( GAAP\u201d).\nRevenues\nWe account for our revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions gross billings to clients include the payroll cost of each WSEE at the client location and a markup computed as a percentage of each WSEEs payroll cost. We invoice the gross billings concurrently with each periodic payroll of our WSEEs. Revenues, which exclude the payroll cost component of gross billings, and therefore, consist solely of the markup, are recognized ratably over the payroll period as WSEEs perform their service at the client worksite. This markup includes pricing components associated with our estimates of payroll taxes, benefits and workers' compensation costs, plus a separate component related to our HR services. Revenues that have been recognized but not invoiced represent unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur revenues are primarily dependent on the number of clients enrolled, the resulting number of WSEEs paid each period and the number of WSEEs enrolled in our benefit plans. Because our total markup is computed as a percentage of payroll cost, certain revenues are also affected by the payroll cost of WSEEs, which may fluctuate based on the composition of the WSEE base, inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies of our markets.\nDirect Costs\nThe primary direct costs associated with revenue-generating activities for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions are:\n\u2022employment-related taxes ( payroll taxes\u201d)\n\u2022costs of employee benefit plans\n\u2022workers' compensation costs\nPayroll taxes consist of the employer's portion of Social Security and Medicare taxes under FICA, federal unemployment taxes and state unemployment taxes. Payroll taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll cost. The federal unemployment tax rates are defined by federal regulations. State unemployment tax rates are subject to claim histories and vary from state to state.\nEmployee benefits costs are comprised primarily of health insurance premiums and claims costs (including dental and pharmacy costs), but also include costs of other employee benefits such as life insurance, vision care, disability insurance, education assistance, adoption assistance, a flexible spending account program and a work-life program.\nWorkers' compensation costs include administrative and risk charges paid to the insurance carrier, and claims costs, which are driven primarily by the frequency and severity of claims.\nGross Profit\nOur gross profit per WSEE is primarily determined by our ability to accurately estimate and control direct costs and our ability to incorporate changes in these costs into the gross billings charged to PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients, which are subject to pricing arrangements that are typically renewed annually. We use gross profit per WSEE per month as our principal measurement of relative performance at the gross profit level.\nOperating Expenses\n\u2022Salaries, wages and payroll taxes - Salaries, wages and payroll taxes ( Salaries\u201d) are primarily a function of the number of corporate employees, their associated average pay and any additional cash incentive compensation.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>41\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur corporate employees include client services, sales and marketing, benefits, legal, finance, information technology, administrative support personnel and those associated with our other products and services.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation - Our stock-based compensation relates to the recognition of non-cash compensation expense over the requisite service period of time-vested and performance-based incentive plan awards.\n\u2022Commissions - Commissions expense consists primarily of amounts paid to sales managers and other sales personnel, including BPAs as well as channel referral fees. Commissions are based on new accounts sold and a percentage of revenue generated by such personnel.\n\u2022Advertising - Advertising expense primarily consists of media advertising and other business promotions in our current and anticipated sales markets, including the Insperity Invitational\u2122 presented by UnitedHealthcare\u00ae sponsorship.\n\u2022General and administrative expenses - Our general and administrative expenses primarily include:\n\u25e6rent expenses related to our service centers and sales offices\n\u25e6outside professional service fees related to legal, consulting, and accounting services\n\u25e6administrative costs, such as postage, printing, and supplies\n\u25e6employee travel and training expenses\n\u25e6technology expenses\n\u25e6facility repairs and maintenance costs\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization - Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily a function of our capital investments in corporate facilities, service centers, sales offices, software development and technology infrastructure.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) includes interest charges incurred in connection with borrowings under our credit facility and interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash and deposits. Please read -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes typically differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21%, due primarily to state income taxes, non-deductible expenses, vesting of equity awards and various tax credits. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities used for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant items resulting in deferred income taxes include prepaid assets, accruals for workers' compensation expenses, stock-based compensation, software development costs, accrued incentive compensation, operating lease assets and liabilities and depreciation. Changes in these items are reflected in our financial statements through a deferred income tax provision. Please read Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial statements, Income Taxes,\u201d for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to health and workers' compensation insurance claims experience, client bad debts, income taxes, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangibles, and contingent liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>42\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe the following accounting policies are critical and/or require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\u2022Benefits costs - We provide group health insurance coverage to our WSEEs through a national network of carriers including United, UnitedHealthcare of California, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California, HMSA BlueCross BlueShield of Hawaii and Tufts, all of which provide fully insured policies or service contracts.\nThe health insurance contract with United provides the majority of our health insurance coverage. As a result of certain contractual terms, we have accounted for this plan since its inception using a partially self-funded insurance accounting model. Accordingly, we record the costs of the United plan, including an estimate of the incurred claims, taxes and administrative fees (collectively the Plan Costs\u201d), as benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The estimated incurred claims are based upon: (1) the level of claims processed during the quarter; (2) estimated completion rates based upon recent claim development patterns under the plan; and (3) the number of participants in the plan, including both active and COBRA enrollees. Each reporting period, changes in the estimated ultimate costs resulting from claim trends, plan design and migration, participant demographics and other factors are incorporated into the benefits costs.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we entered into an arrangement whereby our financial responsibility is limited to the first $1 million of paid claims per claimant per year. Additionally, since the plan's inception, under the terms of the contract, United establishes cash funding rates 90 days in advance of the beginning of a reporting quarter. If the Plan Costs for a reporting quarter are greater than the premiums paid and owed to United, a deficit in the plan would be incurred and we would accrue a liability for the excess costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On the other hand, if the Plan Costs for the reporting quarter are less than the premiums paid and owed to United, a surplus in the plan would be incurred and we would record an asset for the excess premiums in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The terms of the arrangement with United require us to maintain an accumulated cash surplus in the plan of $9.0 million, which is reported as long-term prepaid insurance. As of December 31, 2020, Plan Costs were more than the net premiums paid and owed to United by $6.0 million. As this amount is less than the agreed-upon $9.0 million surplus maintenance level, the $15.0 million difference is included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the premiums owed to United at December 31, 2020, were $11.7 million, which is also included in accrued health insurance costs, a current liability, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe believe that recent claim development patterns are representative of incurred but not reported claims costs during the reporting period. The estimated completion rate used to compute incurred but not reported claims involves a significant level of judgment. Accordingly, an increase (or decrease) in the completion rate used to estimate the incurred claims would result in an increase (or decrease) in benefits costs and net income would decrease (or increase) accordingly.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the completion rate on our estimate of total benefits costs of $2.0 billion in 2020:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in\nCompletion Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in\nBenefits Costs\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change in\nNet Income\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,572) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,829) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,717 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>7,829 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,717) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>19,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,293) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Workers' compensation costs - Since 2007, our workers' compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with Chubb. The Chubb Program is fully insured in that Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policy regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. Under the Chubb Program for claims incurred on or before September 30, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1 million. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million layer of claims per occurrence and, for claims over $1.5 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>43\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause we bear the financial responsibility for claims up to the levels noted above, such claims, which are the primary component of our workers' compensation costs, are recorded in the period incurred. Workers' compensation insurance includes ongoing health care and indemnity coverage whereby claims are paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Accordingly, the accrual of related incurred costs in each reporting period includes estimates, which take into account the ongoing development of claims and therefore requires a significant level of judgment.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary to estimate our loss development rate, which is primarily based upon the nature of WSEEs' job responsibilities, the location of WSEEs, the historical frequency and severity of workers' compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. Each reporting period, changes in the actuarial assumptions resulting from changes in actual claims experience and other trends are incorporated into our workers' compensation claims cost estimates. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reduced accrued workers' compensation costs by $42.1 million and $31.7 million, respectively, for changes in estimated losses related to prior reporting periods. Workers' compensation cost estimates are discounted to present value at a rate based upon the U.S. Treasury rates that correspond with the weighted average estimated claim payout period (the average discount rate was 0.6% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2019) and are accreted over the estimated claim payment period and included as a component of direct costs in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur claim trends could be greater than or less than our prior estimates, in which case we would revise our claims estimates and record an adjustment to workers' compensation costs in the period such determination is made. If we were to experience any significant changes in actuarial assumptions, our loss development rates could increase (or decrease), which would result in an increase (or decrease) in workers' compensation costs and a resulting decrease (or increase) in net income reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table illustrates the sensitivity of changes in the loss development rate on our estimate of workers' compensation costs totaling $65.8 million in 2020:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Loss Development Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Change in Workers' Compensation Costs\n(in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Change in\nNet Income\n(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(5.0)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,165) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,040 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2.5)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,082) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,520 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,520) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.0% </td> <td> </td> <td>4,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,040) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt the beginning of each policy period, the workers' compensation insurance carrier establishes monthly funding requirements comprised of premium costs and funds to be set aside for payment of future claims ( claim funds\u201d). The level of claim funds is primarily based upon anticipated WSEE payroll levels and expected workers' compensation loss rates, as determined by the insurance carrier. Monies funded into the program for incurred claims expected to be paid within one year are recorded as restricted cash, a short-term asset, while the remainder of claim funds are included in deposits, a long-term asset in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2020, we received $28.2 million for the return of excess claim funds related to the workers' compensation program, which decreased deposits. As of December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $45.5 million and deposits of $186.3 million. We have estimated and accrued $240.8 million in incurred workers' compensation claim costs as of December 31, 2020. Our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid within one year is recorded as accrued workers' compensation costs and is included in short-term liabilities, while our estimate of incurred claim costs expected to be paid beyond one year is included in long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\u2022Contingent liabilities - We accrue and disclose contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with ASC 450-10, Contingencies. GAAP requires accrual of contingent liabilities that are considered probable to occur and that can be reasonably estimated. For contingent liabilities that are considered reasonably possible to occur, financial statement disclosure is required, including the range of possible loss if it can be reasonably determined. From time to time, we disclose in our financial statements issues that we believe are reasonably possible to occur, although we cannot determine the range of possible loss in all cases. As issues develop, we evaluate the probability of future loss and the potential range of such losses. If such evaluation were to determine that a loss was probable and the loss could be reasonably estimated, we would be required to accrue our estimated loss, which would reduce net income in the period that such determination was made.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>44\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022Allowance for doubtful accounts - We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to pay their comprehensive service fees. We believe that the success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to collect these comprehensive service fees for several reasons, including:\n\u2022the fact that we are at risk for the payment of our direct costs and WSEE payroll costs regardless of whether our clients pay their comprehensive service fees\n\u2022the large volume and dollar amount of transactions we process\n\u2022the periodic and recurring nature of payroll, upon which the comprehensive service fees are based\nTo mitigate this risk, we have established very tight credit policies. We generally require our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions clients to pay their comprehensive service fees no later than the same day as the applicable payroll date. In addition, we generally maintain the right to terminate the CSA and associated WSEEs or to require prepayment, letters of credit or other collateral if a client's financial position deteriorates or if the client does not pay the comprehensive service fee. As a result of these efforts, losses related to client nonpayment have historically been low as a percentage of revenues. However, if our clients' financial conditions were to deteriorate rapidly, resulting in nonpayment, our accounts receivable balances could grow and we could be required to provide for additional allowances, which would decrease net income in the period that such determination was made.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe believe that we have implemented the accounting pronouncements with a material impact on our financial statements and do not believe there are any new or pending pronouncements that will materially impact our financial position or results of operations. Please read Note 1 Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insperity </td> <td>45\n</td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our key financial and statistical information related to our results of operations:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except per share and statistical data)\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 v 2019 </td> <td>2019 v 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial data:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,287,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,314,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,828,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td>806,854 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>681,909 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>7.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>612,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>502,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>194,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense) </td> <td>(5,419) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,010 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>"}
