Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nWe are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. As of December 31, 2016 we owned and operated 93 new vehicle franchises (77 dealership locations), representing 28 brands of automobiles, and 23 collision centers, in 16 metropolitan markets, within eight states. Our stores offer an extensive range of automotive products and services, including new and used vehicles; parts and service, which include repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair service; and finance and insurance products. As of December 31, 2016, our new vehicle revenue brand mix consisted of 45% imports, 34% luxury, and 21% domestic brands. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 we owned and operated two stand-alone used vehicle stores in Florida.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from: (i) the sale of new vehicles; (ii) the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers (\"used retail\") and to other dealers at auction (\"wholesale\") (the terms \"used retail\" and \"wholesale\" collectively referred to as \"used\"); (iii) repair and maintenance services, including collision repair, the sale of automotive replacement parts, and the reconditioning of used vehicles (collectively referred to as \"parts and service\"); and (iv) the arrangement of third-party vehicle financing and the sale of a number of vehicle protection products (defined below and collectively referred to as \"F&I\"). We evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold, our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit, and our F&I business based on F&I gross profit per vehicle sold.\nWe assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance. Same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.\nOur continued organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy, the continued strength of our brand mix, and the production and allocation of desirable vehicles from the automobile manufacturers whose brands we sell. Our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with product availability as well as local and national economic conditions, including consumer confidence, availability of consumer credit, fuel prices, and employment levels. Additionally, our ability to sell certain new and used vehicles can be negatively impacted by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may include manufacturer imposed stop-sales or open safety recalls, primarily due to, but not limited to, vehicle safety concerns or a vehicle's failure to meet environmental related requirements. We believe that the impact on our business of any future negative trends in new vehicle sales would be partially mitigated by (i) the expected relative stability of our parts and service operations over the long-term, (ii) the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure, and (iii) our diversified brand mix.\nThe United States automotive retail market showed continued year-over-year improvement in 2016, with new vehicle sales increasing slightly to 17.6 million compared to 17.5 million in 2015. The automotive retail business continues to benefit from the availability of credit to consumers, relatively low overall unemployment levels, fuel prices, and interest rates. Demand for new vehicles is generally highest during the second and third quarters of each year and, accordingly, we expect our revenues to generally be higher during these periods. We typically experience higher sales of luxury vehicles in the fourth quarter, which have higher average selling prices and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Revenues and operating results may be impacted significantly from quarter-to-quarter by changing economic conditions, vehicle manufacturer incentive programs, or adverse weather events.\nOur gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Sales of new vehicles generally result in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales, sales of parts and service, and sales of F&I products. As a result, when used vehicle, parts and service, and F&I revenue increase as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase.\nSelling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A significant portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions), or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long-term. We evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit, advertising expense on a per vehicle retailed (\"PVR\") basis, and all other SG&A expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit.\nWe had total available liquidity of $406.0 million as of December 31, 2016, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million, $70.9 million of funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be re-designated to our revolving credit facility, $51.1 million of availability under our revolving\ncredit facility, and $90.6 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. For further discussion of our liquidity, please refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions, that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements, in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from the sale of new and used vehicles (which excludes sales tax), is recognized upon the latest of delivery, signing of the sales contract or approval of financing. Manufacturer incentives and rebates, including manufacturer holdbacks, floor plan interest assistance and certain advertising assistance, are recognized as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales at the time the related vehicles are sold.\nRevenue from the sale of parts, service, and collision repair work (which excludes sales tax), is recognized upon the delivery of parts to the customer or at the time vehicle service or repair work is completed, as applicable.\nWe receive commissions from third-party lending and insurance institutions for arranging customer financing and from the sale of vehicle service contracts, guaranteed auto protection (known as \"GAP\") insurance, and other insurance to customers (collectively \"F&I\"). We may be charged back for F&I commissions in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated (\"chargebacks\"). F&I commissions are recorded at the time the associated vehicle is sold. F&I commissions, net of estimated future chargebacks, are included in Finance and Insurance, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, we participate in future profits associated with the performance of the third-party held underlying portfolio for certain products pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Our retrospective portfolio income is recorded as revenue at the time it is received from our third-party providers.\nUsed Vehicle Inventory Lower of Cost or Market Reserves-\nOur used vehicle inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the specific identification method to value our used vehicle inventories. We maintain a reserve for used vehicle inventory when cost basis exceeds fair value. In assessing lower of cost or market for used vehicles, we consider (i) the age of our used vehicles, (ii) historical sales experience of used vehicles and (iii) current market conditions and trends in used vehicle sales. We also review and consider the following metrics related to used vehicle sales (both on a recent and longer-term historical basis): (i) days of supply in our used vehicle inventory, (ii) used vehicle units sold at less than original cost as a percentage of total used vehicles sold and (iii) average vehicle selling price of used vehicle units sold at less than original cost. We then determine the appropriate level of reserve required to reduce our used vehicle inventory to the lower of cost or market, and record the resulting adjustment in the period in which we determine a loss has occurred. The level of reserve determined to be appropriate for each reporting period is considered to be a permanent inventory write-down and therefore is only released upon the sale of the related inventory. Our used vehicle inventory reserves are as follows: Table 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicle lower of cost or market reserve:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Reserve Amount (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percentage of Gross Used Vehicle Inventory\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate would change our used vehicle inventory reserve by approximately $1.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nF&I Chargeback Reserve-\nWe reserve for chargebacks on finance, insurance, or vehicle service contract commissions received. The reserve is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts. This data is\nevaluated on a product-by-product basis. Our loss histories vary depending on the product, but generally range from 9% to 15% of F&I revenues. Our F&I cash chargebacks for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $34.9 million, $31.3 million, and $25.8 million, respectively. Our chargeback reserves were $43.0 million and $38.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Total chargebacks as a percentage of F&I revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were 14%, 13%, and 12%, respectively. A 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate for future chargebacks, would change our finance and insurance chargeback reserve by approximately $3.5 million as of December 31, 2016.\nInsurance Reserves-\nWe are self-insured for employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for large-dollar individual claims. We have large deductible insurance programs for workers compensation, property and general liability claims. We maintain and review our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our expected future liability for these claims. We also use professional service providers, such as account administrators and actuaries, to help us accumulate and assess this information. Provisions for retained losses and deductibles are made by charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims.\nWe had $14.5 million and $13.3 million of insurance reserves for both known and unknown employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Expenses associated with employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, including premiums for insurance coverage, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, totaled $30.9 million, $26.9 million, and $27.1 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and Manufacturer Franchise Rights-\nGoodwill represents the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair market value of its identifiable assets and liabilities. We have determined that, based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business, how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another, and how we review the results of our operations, that we have several geographic market-based operating segments. We have determined that the dealerships in each of our operating segments are components that are aggregated into several geographic market-based reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, as they (i) have similar economic characteristics, (ii) offer similar products and services (all of our franchised dealerships offer new and used vehicles, parts and service, and arrange for third-party vehicle financing and the sale of insurance products), (iii) have similar customers, (iv) have similar distribution and marketing practices (all of our dealerships distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar ways) and (v) operate under similar regulatory environments.\nOur only significant identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, are our rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers, which are recorded at an individual franchise level. The fair value of our manufacturer franchise rights are determined at the acquisition date, by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise. We have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives, and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers' brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing our manufacturer franchise rights would expire, we expect that we would be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business.\nWe do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually as of October 1st, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that any impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our automotive retail business or manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our individual franchises.\nWe completed our annual intangible impairment tests as of October 1, 2016, and no impairments of goodwill or manufacturer franchise rights were recognized as a result of such tests.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td>

during 2016 decreased by $60.5 million (1%) compared to 2015, due to a $55.3 million (3%) decrease in used vehicle revenue, a $40.6 million (1%) decrease in new vehicle revenue, and a $2.4 million (1%) decrease in F&I revenue, partially offset by a $37.8 million (5%) increase in parts and service revenue. The $2.1 million decrease in gross profit during 2016 was the result of a $15.9 million (8%) decrease in new vehicle gross profit, a $4.5 million (3%) decrease in used vehicle gross profit, and a $2.4 million (1%) decrease in F&I gross profit, partially offset by a $20.7 million (4%) increase in parts and service gross profit. Our total gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.2%, primarily due to our parts and service business, which has higher margins than new and used vehicle sales, representing a larger percentage of our total revenue for the year ended 2016 compared to the year ended 2015.\nIncome from operations during 2016 decreased by $3.8 million (1%) compared to 2015, primarily due to the $2.1 million decrease in gross profit, increases in SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization of $2.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in other operating income, net. Total other expenses increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to increases in floor plan interest expense and other interest expense, net of $3.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in the gain on divestitures. As a result, income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by $5.6 million (2%) to $267.8 million in 2016. The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes, resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $3.4 million (3%). Net income decreased by $2.0 million (1%) to $167.2 million in 2016.\nWe assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a\nsame store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to\nassess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.\nNew Vehicle-\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Our 1% decrease in same store unit volumes, was primarily the result of a 5% decrease in luxury units, partially offset by a 1% increase in domestic units. We attribute the decrease in luxury unit volumes to a consumer preference shift from cars to trucks, due in part to lower gas prices, which tends to favor domestic brands.\nSame store new vehicle gross profit in 2016 decreased by $12.3 million (6%), as a result of the 1% decrease in unit volumes and a 5% decrease in gross profit per new vehicle sold. New vehicle gross margin in 2016 decreased by 40 basis points to 5.2%, primarily attributable to the decrease in luxury unit volumes, which have higher margins than import and domestic vehicles,

partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed. Same store used vehicle revenue increased by $10.4 million (1%), due to a 1% increase in revenue per used vehicle retailed.\nIn 2016, same store used vehicle retail gross profit decreased by $1.5 million (1%), resulting in a slight decrease in gross margin from 8.0% in 2015 to 7.8% in 2016. We primarily attribute the 20 basis point decrease in same store used vehicle retail gross profit margin, to increased competition and price transparency within the used vehicle marketplace. In addition, our effort to retail more used vehicles, specifically in the fourth quarter of 2016, resulted in lower margins on used vehicles, but delivered on our strategic focus to grow our reconditioning and preparation and finance and insurance businesses.\nWe believe that our used vehicle inventory continues to be well-aligned with current consumer demand, with approximately 30 days of supply as of December 31, 2016.\nParts and Service-\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit increased by 70 basis points, from 68.3% in 2015 to 69.0% in 2016. The increase, was due primarily to increased personnel costs, which was a result of higher employee benefit costs, and higher insurance expense, which includes expenses associated with hail storm damage incurred at certain of our dealerships during 2016. We continue to be engaged in numerous productivity initiatives designed to reduce our fixed cost structure and we continue to focus on refining our centralized business processes to further enhance our performance.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense -\nThe $1.2 million (4%) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2016 compared to 2015, was primarily the result of increased capital expenditures and the completion of construction projects, resulting in newly depreciable assets placed into service during the year.\nOther Operating Income, net -\nOther operating expense, net includes gains and losses from the sale of property and equipment, income derived from lease arrangements, and other non-core operating items. The $2.3 million in other operating income, net for 2016, was primarily due to $6.6 million in gains resulting from legal settlements, partially offset by $5.7 million of real estate related charges, including impairments and lease terminations.\nFloor Plan Interest Expense -\nThe $3.2 million (20%) increase in floor plan interest expense during 2016 compared to 2015, was the result of higher average new vehicle inventory levels and higher interest rates throughout 2016 compared with 2015.\nOther Interest Expense -\nOther interest expense increased $9.1 million (21%) from $44.0 million in 2015 to $53.1 million in 2016. The increase in interest expense, was primarily the result of our add-on issuance of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which we completed in October 2015.\nGain on Divestitures -\nIncluded in the results of 2016, were $45.5 million of gains related to the current year sale of five franchises (four dealership locations) and two collision centers.\nIncome Tax Expense-\nThe $3.4 million (3%) decrease in income tax expense, was primarily a result of the $5.6 million (2%) decrease in income before income taxes in 2016 compared to 2015. Our effective tax rate was 37.6% in 2016 compared to 38.0% in 2015. Our effective tax rate, which we generally expect to approximate 38.0%, is highly dependent on our level of income before income taxes and permanent differences between book and tax income.\nRESULTS

increased by $720.6 million (12%) compared to 2014, as a result of a $421.9 million\n(13%) increase in new vehicle revenue, a $190.2 million (11%) increase in used vehicle revenue, a $74.1 million (11%)\nincrease in parts and service revenue, and a $34.4 million (15%) increase in F&I revenue. The $93.6 million (10%) increase\nin gross profit during 2015, was driven by a $50.4 million (12%) increase in parts and service gross profit, a $34.4 million\n(15%) increase in F&I gross profit, a $4.7 million (2%) increase in new vehicle gross profit, and a $4.1 million (3%)\nincrease in used vehicle gross profit. Our total gross profit margin decreased 40 basis points to 16.1%, primarily due to competitive pressures negatively impacting our gross margins across our new vehicle and used vehicle businesses, partially offset by an increase in gross margin for our parts and service business and growth in our F&I business.\nIncome from operations during 2015 increased by $33.4 million (12%) compared to 2014, primarily due to the $93.6 million increase in gross profit, partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization of $58.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Total other expenses decreased by $57.0 million, primarily due to a $34.9 million gain on divestitures in 2015 and a $31.9 million loss on extinguishment of long-term debt in 2014. As a result, income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $90.4 million (49%) to $273.4 million in 2015. The increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes, resulted in an increase in income tax expense of $33.0 million (46%). Net income increased by $57.6 million (52%) to $169.2 million in 2015.\nWe assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. As such, for the following discussion,\nsame store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with\nthe first month we owned the dealership.

Same store new vehicle gross profit decreased by\n$2.7 million (1%), resulting in a 60 basis point decrease in gross margin to 5.6% in 2015.

Our same store gross profit per new vehicle sold decreased by $159 (8%). The decrease in new vehicle gross profit and gross margin is primarily driven by a shift in consumer preference from cars to trucks, due in part to lower gas prices, and increased competition in the

The 6% increase in same store used vehicle retail revenue is the result of a 3% increase in same store used vehicle unit volumes and a 3% increase in same store revenue per used vehicle sold.

We primarily attribute the 40 basis point decrease in same store used vehicle retail gross profit margin from 8.5% to 8.1% to our efforts to grow sales volumes during the current year, increased

expense as a percentage of gross profit was 68.8% for 2015 compared to 69.4% for 2014. Same store SG&A expense as a percentage of gross profit decreased by 50 basis points, from 69.4% in 2014 to 68.9% in 2015, primarily driven by a decrease in personnel costs as a percentage of gross profit. We continue to be engaged in numerous productivity initiatives designed to further reduce our fixed cost structure and we continue to focus on refining our centralized business processes to further enhance our performance.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense -\nThe $3.1 million (12%) increase in depreciation and amortization expense during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily the result of additional fixed assets acquired in acquisitions and the completion of construction projects that resulted in newly depreciable assets placed into service during the year.\nFloor Plan Interest Expense -\nThe $3.7 million (30%) increase in floor plan interest expense during 2015 compared to 2014, was primarily driven by higher new vehicle inventory levels due to acquisitions made in late 2014 and 2015.\nOther Interest Expense -\nOther interest expense increased $5.1 million (13%) from $38.9 million in 2014 to $44.0 million in 2015. During 2015, our mortgage interest expense increased approximately $2.2 million (19%) as a result of mortgaging certain owned dealership properties during 2014 and 2015. In addition, there was an increase in interest expense during 2015, as a result of our add-on issuance of $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.0% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2024, which we completed in October 2015.\nGain on Divestitures -\nIncluded in the results of 2015, were $34.9 million of gains related to the current year sale of seven franchises (five dealership locations) and one collision center.\nIncome Tax Expense-\nThe $33.0 million (46%) increase in income tax expense, was primarily a result of the $90.4 million (49%) increase in income before income taxes in 2015 compared to 2014. Our effective tax rate was 38.0% in 2015 compared to 38.8% in 2014. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent on our level of income before income taxes and permanent differences between book and tax income.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total available liquidity of $406.0 million, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million, $70.9 million of available funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be re-designated to our revolving credit facility, $51.1 million of availability under our revolving credit facility, and $90.6 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. The borrowing capacities under our revolving credit facility and our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility are limited by borrowing base calculations and, from time to time, may be further limited by our required compliance with certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2016, these financial covenants did not further limit our availability under our other credit facilities. For more information on our financial covenants, see \"Covenants and Defaults\" below.\nWe continually evaluate our liquidity and capital resources based upon (i) our cash and cash equivalents on hand, (ii) the funds that we expect to generate through future operations, (iii) current and expected borrowing availability under our 2016 Senior Credit Facility, our other floor plan facilities, our Real Estate Credit Agreement, our Restated Master Loan Agreement, and our mortgage financings (each, as defined below), (iv) amounts in our new vehicle floor plan notes payable offset accounts, and (v) the potential impact of our capital allocation strategy and any contemplated or pending future transactions, including, but not limited to, financings, acquisitions, dispositions, equity and/or debt repurchases, dividends, or other capital expenditures. We believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our debt service and working capital requirements; commitments and contingencies; debt repayment, maturity and repurchase obligations; acquisitions; capital expenditures; and any operating requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nWe currently are party to the following material credit facilities and agreements, and have the following material indebtedness outstanding. For a more detailed description of the material terms of these agreements and facilities, and this indebtedness, refer to the \"Long-Term Debt\" footnote included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2016 Senior Credit Facility - On July 25, 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated senior secured credit agreement with Bank of America, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto.

As of December 31, 2016, we re-designated $190.0 million of availability from our revolving credit facility to our new vehicle floor plan facility, resulting in $60.0 million of borrowing capacity. In addition, we had $8.9 million in outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $51.1 million of borrowing availability as of December 31, 2016.\nNew Vehicle Floor Plan Facility - A $900.0 million new vehicle revolving floor plan facility. In connection, with the new vehicle floor plan facility, we established an account with Bank of America that allows us to transfer cash as an offset to floor plan notes payable. These transfers reduce the amount of outstanding new vehicle floor plan notes payable that would otherwise accrue interest, while retaining the ability to transfer amounts from the offset account into our operating cash accounts within one to two days. As a result of the use of our floor plan offset account, we experience a reduction in Floor Plan Interest Expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2016, we had $673.5 million, which is net of $59.2 million in our floor plan offset account, outstanding under our new vehicle floor plan facility.\nUsed Vehicle Floor Plan Facility - A $150.0 million used vehicle revolving floor plan facility to finance the acquisition of used vehicle inventory and for, among other things, working capital and capital expenditures, as well as to refinance used vehicles. Our borrowing capacity under the used vehicle floor plan facility was limited to $90.6 million, based on our borrowing base calculation as of December 31, 2016. We began the year with nothing drawn on our used vehicle floor plan facility and during the year ended December 31, 2016, we had borrowings of $55.0 million and made repayments of $55.0 million, resulting in no outstanding amounts under our used vehicle floor plan facility as of December 31, 2016.\nSubject to compliance with certain conditions, the agreement governing the 2016 Senior Credit Facility provides that we have the ability, at our option and subject to the receipt of additional commitments from existing or new lenders, to increase the size of the facilities by up to $325.0 million in the aggregate without lender consent.\nAt our option, we have the ability to re-designate a portion of our availability under our revolving credit facility to the new vehicle floor plan facility or the used vehicle floor plan facility. The maximum amount we are allowed to re-designate is determined based on our current borrowing availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, less $50.0 million. In addition, we are able to re-designate any amounts moved to the new vehicle floor plan facility or used vehicle floor plan facility back to the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we re-designated $190.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility to our new vehicle floor plan facility. We re-designated this amount to take advantage of the lower commitment fee rates on our new vehicle floor plan facility when compared to our revolving credit facility.\nBorrowings under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") or the Base Rate, in each case plus an Applicable Margin. The Base Rate is the highest of the (i) Bank of America prime rate, (ii) Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The Applicable Margin, for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, ranges from 1.25% to 2.50% for LIBOR loans and 0.25% to 1.50% for Base Rate loans, in each case based on the Company's total lease adjusted leverage ratio. Borrowings under the New Vehicle Floor Plan Facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on LIBOR plus 1.25% or the Base Rate plus 0.25%. Borrowings under the Used Vehicle Floor Plan Facility bear interest, at the option of the Company, based on LIBOR plus 1.50% or the Base Rate plus 0.50%.\nIn addition to the payment of interest on borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the total commitments thereunder. The fee for commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility is between 0.20% and 0.45% per year, based on the Company's total lease adjusted leverage ratio, and the fee for commitments under the New Vehicle Facility Floor Plan and the Used Vehicle Facility Floor Plan Facility is 0.15% per year.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Manufacturer affiliated new vehicle floor plan facilities and other financing facilities - We have a floor plan facility with the Ford Motor Credit Company (\"Ford Credit\") to purchase new Ford and Lincoln vehicle inventory, which matures on December 5, 2019.

We were in compliance with all of our covenants as of December 31, 2016. Failure to comply with any of our debt covenants would constitute a default under the relevant debt agreements, which would entitle the lenders under such agreements to terminate our ability to borrow under the relevant agreements and accelerate our obligations to repay outstanding borrowings, if any, unless compliance with the covenants were waived. In many cases, defaults under one of our agreements could trigger cross-default provisions in our other agreements. If we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial or other covenants, we would be required to seek waivers or modifications of our covenants from our lenders, or we would need to raise debt and/or equity financing or sell assets to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt. We cannot give any assurance that we would be able to successfully take any of these actions on terms, or at times, that may be necessary or desirable.\nThe representations and covenants contained in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility include, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets.\nThe 2016 Senior Credit Facility also provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. In certain instances, an event of default under either the revolving credit facility or the used vehicle floor plan facility could be, or result in, an event of default under the new vehicle floor plan facility, and vice versa. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, we could be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the 2016 Senior Credit Facility.\nThe representations and covenants contained in the Real Estate Credit Agreement are customary for financing transactions of this nature including, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, and a maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in the Real Estate Credit Agreement. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends or acquire or dispose of assets.\nThe representations, warranties, and covenants contained in the Restated Master Loan Agreement and the related documents include, among others, a requirement to comply with a minimum consolidated current ratio, minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum consolidated total lease adjusted leverage ratio, in each case as set out in such documents. In addition, certain other covenants could restrict our ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, or acquire or dispose of assets. The Restated Master Loan Agreement also provides for events of default that are customary for financing transactions of this nature, including cross-defaults to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Real Estate Borrowers or, failing such compliance, we could be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the Restated Master Loan Agreement.\nCertain of our lease agreements also require compliance with various financial covenants and incorporate by reference the financial covenants set forth in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility. A breach of any of these covenants could immediately give rise to certain landlord remedies under our various lease agreements, the most severe of which include the following: (i) termination of the applicable lease and/or other leases with the same or an affiliated landlord under a cross-default provision, (ii) eviction from the premises, and (iii) the landlord having a claim for various damages.\nThe 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture currently allow for restricted payments without limit so long as our consolidated total leverage ratio (as defined in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture) is no greater than 3.0 to 1.0\nafter giving effect to such proposed restricted payments. Restricted payments generally include items such as dividends, share repurchases, unscheduled repayments of subordinated debt, or purchases of certain investments. In the event that our consolidated total leverage ratio does (or would) exceed 3.0 to 1.0, the 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture would then also allow for restricted payments under the following mutually exclusive parameters, subject to certain exclusions:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Restricted payments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $20.0 million in any fiscal year;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General restricted payments allowance of $150.0 million; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Subject to our continued compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio as set out in the Indenture, restricted payments capacity additions (or subtractions if negative) equal to (i) 50% of our net income (as defined in the 2016 Senior Credit Facility and the Indenture) beginning on October 1, 2014 and ending on the date of the most recently completed fiscal quarter (the \"Measurement Period\"), plus (ii) 100% of any cash proceeds we receive from the sale of equity interests during the Measurement Period minus (iii) the dollar amount of share purchases made and dividends paid on or after December 4, 2014.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Share Repurchases and Dividend Restrictions\nOur ability to repurchase shares or pay dividends on our common stock is subject to our compliance with the covenants and restrictions described in \"Covenants and Defaults\" above.\nOn January 30, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized our current share repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\"). On January 27, 2016, our Board of Directors reset the authorization under our Repurchase Program to $300.0 million in the aggregate, for the repurchase of our common stock in open market transactions or privately negotiated transactions from time to time. During 2016, we repurchased 3,730,642 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program for a total of $211.9 million. As of December 31, 2016 we had remaining authorization to repurchase $88.1 million in shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program.\nDuring 2016, we repurchased 70,411 shares of our common stock for $3.7 million from employees in connection with a net share settlement feature of employee equity-based awards.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had the following contractual obligations (in millions): Table 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floor plan notes payable (Note 10)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>781.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>781.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases (Note 18)\n</td> <td>27.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (Note 13)\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>810.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>931.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td>50.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>875.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>92.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>100.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>982.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,244.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Includes variable rate interest payments calculated using an estimated LIBOR rate of 0.77%, and assumes that borrowings will not be refinanced upon maturity.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows\nClassification of Cash Flows Associated with Floor Plan Notes Payable\nBorrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to a lender unaffiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle (\"Non-Trade\"), and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles (together referred to as \"Floor Plan Notes Payable-Non-Trade\"), are classified as financing activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, with borrowings reflected separately from repayments. The net change in floor plan notes payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase a particular new vehicle (collectively referred to as \"Floor Plan Notes Payable-Trade\") is classified as an operating activity on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Borrowings of floor plan notes payable associated with inventory acquired in connection with all acquisitions and repayments made in connection with all divestitures are classified as a financing activity in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in operating activities differ from cash flows related to floor plan notes payable included in financing activities only to the extent that the former are payable to a lender affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory, while the latter are payable to a lender not\naffiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchased the related inventory. The majority of our floor plan notes are payable to parties unaffiliated with the entities from which we purchase our new vehicle inventory, with the exception of floor plan notes payable relating to the financing of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles.\nFloor plan borrowings are required by all vehicle manufacturers for the purchase of new vehicles, and all floor plan lenders require amounts borrowed for the purchase of a vehicle to be repaid within a short time period after the related vehicle is sold. As a result, we believe that it is important to understand the relationship between the cash flows of all of our floor plan notes payable and new vehicle inventory in order to understand our working capital and operating cash flow and to be able to compare our operating cash flow to that of our competitors (i.e., if our competitors have a different mix of trade and non-trade floor plan financing as compared to us). In addition, we include all floor plan borrowings and repayments in our internal operating cash flow forecasts. As a result, we use the non-GAAP measure \"cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted\" (defined below) to compare our results to forecasts. We believe that splitting the cash flows of floor plan notes payable between operating activities and financing activities, while all new vehicle inventory activity is included in operating activities, results in significantly different operating cash flow than if all the cash flows of floor plan notes payable were classified together in operating activities.\nCash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, includes borrowings and repayments of floor plan notes payable to lenders not affiliated with the manufacturer from which we purchase the related new vehicles and all floor plan notes payable relating to used vehicles. Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted, has material limitations, and therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results in accordance with GAAP. In order to compensate for these potential limitations we also review the related GAAP measures.\nWe have provided below a reconciliation of cash flow from operating activities, as if all changes in floor plan notes payable, except for (i) borrowings associated with acquisitions and repayments associated with divestitures and (ii) borrowings and repayments associated with the purchase of used vehicle inventory, were classified as an operating activity.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities, as reported\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>155.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>84.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New vehicle floor plan borrowings (repayments)-non-trade, net\n</td> <td>118.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>260.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities-\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $142.3 million, $155.4 million, and $84.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nWe are one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States. As of December 31, 2016 we owned and operated 93 new vehicle franchises (77 dealership locations), representing 28 brands of automobiles, and 23 collision centers, in 16 metropolitan markets, within eight states. Our stores offer an extensive range of automotive products and services, including new and used vehicles; parts and service, which include repair and maintenance services, replacement parts, and collision repair service; and finance and insurance products. As of December 31, 2016, our new vehicle revenue brand mix consisted of 45% imports, 34% luxury, and 21% domestic brands. In addition, as of December 31, 2016 we owned and operated two stand-alone used vehicle stores in Florida.\nOur revenues are derived primarily from: (i) the sale of new vehicles; (ii) the sale of used vehicles to individual retail customers (\"used retail\") and to other dealers at auction (\"wholesale\") (the terms \"used retail\" and \"wholesale\" collectively referred to as \"used\"); (iii) repair and maintenance services, including collision repair, the sale of automotive replacement parts, and the reconditioning of used vehicles (collectively referred to as \"parts and service\"); and (iv) the arrangement of third-party vehicle financing and the sale of a number of vehicle protection products (defined below and collectively referred to as \"F&I\"). We evaluate the results of our new and used vehicle sales based on unit volumes and gross profit per vehicle sold, our parts and service operations based on aggregate gross profit, and our F&I business based on F&I gross profit per vehicle sold.\nWe assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance. Same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.\nOur continued organic growth is dependent upon the execution of our balanced automotive retailing and service business strategy, the continued strength of our brand mix, and the production and allocation of desirable vehicles from the automobile manufacturers whose brands we sell. Our vehicle sales have historically fluctuated with product availability as well as local and national economic conditions, including consumer confidence, availability of consumer credit, fuel prices, and employment levels. Additionally, our ability to sell certain new and used vehicles can be negatively impacted by a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control and may include manufacturer imposed stop-sales or open safety recalls, primarily due to, but not limited to, vehicle safety concerns or a vehicle's failure to meet environmental related requirements. We believe that the impact on our business of any future negative trends in new vehicle sales would be partially mitigated by (i) the expected relative stability of our parts and service operations over the long-term, (ii) the variable nature of significant components of our cost structure, and (iii) our diversified brand mix.\nThe United States automotive retail market showed continued year-over-year improvement in 2016, with new vehicle sales increasing slightly to 17.6 million compared to 17.5 million in 2015. The automotive retail business continues to benefit from the availability of credit to consumers, relatively low overall unemployment levels, fuel prices, and interest rates. Demand for new vehicles is generally highest during the second and third quarters of each year and, accordingly, we expect our revenues to generally be higher during these periods. We typically experience higher sales of luxury vehicles in the fourth quarter, which have higher average selling prices and gross profit per vehicle retailed. Revenues and operating results may be impacted significantly from quarter-to-quarter by changing economic conditions, vehicle manufacturer incentive programs, or adverse weather events.\nOur gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Sales of new vehicles generally result in lower gross profit margin than used vehicle sales, sales of parts and service, and sales of F&I products. As a result, when used vehicle, parts and service, and F&I revenue increase as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase.\nSelling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses consist primarily of fixed and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A significant portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions), or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long-term. We evaluate commissions paid to salespeople as a percentage of retail vehicle gross profit, advertising expense on a per vehicle retailed (\"PVR\") basis, and all other SG&A expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total gross profit.\nWe had total available liquidity of $406.0 million as of December 31, 2016, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $3.4 million, $70.9 million of funds in our floor plan offset accounts, $190.0 million of availability under our new vehicle floor plan facility that is able to be re-designated to our revolving credit facility, $51.1 million of availability under our revolving\ncredit facility, and $90.6 million of availability under our used vehicle revolving floor plan facility. For further discussion of our liquidity, please refer to \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" below.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to make estimates and assumptions, that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements, in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Set forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from the sale of new and used vehicles (which excludes sales tax), is recognized upon the latest of delivery, signing of the sales contract or approval of financing. Manufacturer incentives and rebates, including manufacturer holdbacks, floor plan interest assistance and certain advertising assistance, are recognized as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales at the time the related vehicles are sold.\nRevenue from the sale of parts, service, and collision repair work (which excludes sales tax), is recognized upon the delivery of parts to the customer or at the time vehicle service or repair work is completed, as applicable.\nWe receive commissions from third-party lending and insurance institutions for arranging customer financing and from the sale of vehicle service contracts, guaranteed auto protection (known as \"GAP\") insurance, and other insurance to customers (collectively \"F&I\"). We may be charged back for F&I commissions in the event a contract is prepaid, defaulted upon, or terminated (\"chargebacks\"). F&I commissions are recorded at the time the associated vehicle is sold. F&I commissions, net of estimated future chargebacks, are included in Finance and Insurance, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, we participate in future profits associated with the performance of the third-party held underlying portfolio for certain products pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements. Our retrospective portfolio income is recorded as revenue at the time it is received from our third-party providers.\nUsed Vehicle Inventory Lower of Cost or Market Reserves-\nOur used vehicle inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. We use the specific identification method to value our used vehicle inventories. We maintain a reserve for used vehicle inventory when cost basis exceeds fair value. In assessing lower of cost or market for used vehicles, we consider (i) the age of our used vehicles, (ii) historical sales experience of used vehicles and (iii) current market conditions and trends in used vehicle sales. We also review and consider the following metrics related to used vehicle sales (both on a recent and longer-term historical basis): (i) days of supply in our used vehicle inventory, (ii) used vehicle units sold at less than original cost as a percentage of total used vehicles sold and (iii) average vehicle selling price of used vehicle units sold at less than original cost. We then determine the appropriate level of reserve required to reduce our used vehicle inventory to the lower of cost or market, and record the resulting adjustment in the period in which we determine a loss has occurred. The level of reserve determined to be appropriate for each reporting period is considered to be a permanent inventory write-down and therefore is only released upon the sale of the related inventory. Our used vehicle inventory reserves are as follows: \nA 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate would change our used vehicle inventory reserve by approximately $1.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nF&I Chargeback Reserve-\nWe reserve for chargebacks on finance, insurance, or vehicle service contract commissions received. The reserve is established based on historical operating results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts. This data is\nevaluated on a product-by-product basis. Our loss histories vary depending on the product, but generally range from 9% to 15% of F&I revenues. Our F&I cash chargebacks for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $34.9 million, $31.3 million, and $25.8 million, respectively. Our chargeback reserves were $43.0 million and $38.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Total chargebacks as a percentage of F&I revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, were 14%, 13%, and 12%, respectively. A 100 basis point change in our estimated reserve rate for future chargebacks, would change our finance and insurance chargeback reserve by approximately $3.5 million as of December 31, 2016.\nInsurance Reserves-\nWe are self-insured for employee medical claims and maintain stop loss insurance for large-dollar individual claims. We have large deductible insurance programs for workers compensation, property and general liability claims. We maintain and review our claim and loss history to assist in assessing our expected future liability for these claims. We also use professional service providers, such as account administrators and actuaries, to help us accumulate and assess this information. Provisions for retained losses and deductibles are made by charges to expense based upon periodic evaluations of the estimated ultimate liabilities on reported and unreported claims.\nWe had $14.5 million and $13.3 million of insurance reserves for both known and unknown employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, net of anticipated insurance recoveries, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Expenses associated with employee medical, workers compensation, property, and general liability claims, including premiums for insurance coverage, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, totaled $30.9 million, $26.9 million, and $27.1 million, respectively.\nGoodwill and Manufacturer Franchise Rights-\nGoodwill represents the excess cost of an acquired business over the fair market value of its identifiable assets and liabilities. We have determined that, based on how we integrate acquisitions into our business, how the components of our business share resources and interact with one another, and how we review the results of our operations, that we have several geographic market-based operating segments. We have determined that the dealerships in each of our operating segments are components that are aggregated into several geographic market-based reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, as they (i) have similar economic characteristics, (ii) offer similar products and services (all of our franchised dealerships offer new and used vehicles, parts and service, and arrange for third-party vehicle financing and the sale of insurance products), (iii) have similar customers, (iv) have similar distribution and marketing practices (all of our dealerships distribute products and services through dealership facilities that market to customers in similar ways) and (v) operate under similar regulatory environments.\nOur only significant identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill, are our rights under franchise agreements with manufacturers, which are recorded at an individual franchise level. The fair value of our manufacturer franchise rights are determined at the acquisition date, by discounting the projected cash flows specific to each franchise. We have determined that manufacturer franchise rights have an indefinite life as there are no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives, and they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely due to the historically long lives of the manufacturers' brand names. Furthermore, to the extent that any agreements evidencing our manufacturer franchise rights would expire, we expect that we would be able to renew those agreements in the ordinary course of business.\nWe do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives. We review goodwill and manufacturer franchise rights for impairment annually as of October 1st, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that any impairment may have occurred. We are subject to financial statement risk to the extent that goodwill becomes impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our automotive retail business or manufacturer franchise rights become impaired due to decreases in the fair value of our individual franchises.\nWe completed our annual intangible impairment tests as of October 1, 2016, and no impairments of goodwill or manufacturer franchise rights were recognized as a result of such tests.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\n______________________________\nNM-Not Meaningful\n\nTotal revenue during 2016 decreased by $60.5 million (1%) compared to 2015, due to a $55.3 million (3%) decrease in used vehicle revenue, a $40.6 million (1%) decrease in new vehicle revenue, and a $2.4 million (1%) decrease in F&I revenue, partially offset by a $37.8 million (5%) increase in parts and service revenue. The $2.1 million decrease in gross profit during 2016 was the result of a $15.9 million (8%) decrease in new vehicle gross profit, a $4.5 million (3%) decrease in used vehicle gross profit, and a $2.4 million (1%) decrease in F&I gross profit, partially offset by a $20.7 million (4%) increase in parts and service gross profit. Our total gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.2%, primarily due to our parts and service business, which has higher margins than new and used vehicle sales, representing a larger percentage of our total revenue for the year ended 2016 compared to the year ended 2015.\nIncome from operations during 2016 decreased by $3.8 million (1%) compared to 2015, primarily due to the $2.1 million decrease in gross profit, increases in SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization of $2.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in other operating income, net. Total other expenses increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to increases in floor plan interest expense and other interest expense, net of $3.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in the gain on divestitures. As a result, income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by $5.6 million (2%) to $267.8 million in 2016. The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes, resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $3.4 million (3%). Net income decreased by $2.0 million (1%) to $167.2 million in 2016.\nWe assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a\nsame store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to\nassess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.\nNew Vehicle-\n\nNew Vehicle Metrics-\n\nNew vehicle revenue decreased by $40.6 million (1%), primarily as a result of a 3% decrease in new vehicle units sold, partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue increased by $31.3 million (1%) as a result of a 2% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold, partially offset by a 1% decrease in new vehicle units sold.\nU.S. new vehicle sales were 17.6 million in 2016 and, was relatively stable compared to 17.5 million in 2015. Our 1% decrease in same store unit volumes, was primarily the result of a 5% decrease in luxury units, partially offset by a 1% increase in domestic units. We attribute the decrease in luxury unit volumes to a consumer preference shift from cars to trucks, due in part to lower gas prices, which tends to favor domestic brands.\nSame store new vehicle gross profit in 2016 decreased by $12.3 million (6%), as a result of the 1% decrease in unit volumes and a 5% decrease in gross profit per new vehicle sold. New vehicle gross margin in 2016 decreased by 40 basis points to 5.2%, primarily attributable to the decrease in luxury unit volumes, which have higher margins than import and domestic vehicles, reduced manufacturer incentives and increased competition in the marketplace for import and domestic vehicles.\nUsed Vehicle-\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

during 2016 decreased by $60.5 million (1%) compared to 2015, due to a $55.3 million (3%) decrease in used vehicle revenue, a $40.6 million (1%) decrease in new vehicle revenue, and a $2.4 million (1%) decrease in F&I revenue, partially offset by a $37.8 million (5%) increase in parts and service revenue. The $2.1 million decrease in gross profit during 2016 was the result of a $15.9 million (8%) decrease in new vehicle gross profit, a $4.5 million (3%) decrease in used vehicle gross profit, and a $2.4 million (1%) decrease in F&I gross profit, partially offset by a $20.7 million (4%) increase in parts and service gross profit. Our total gross profit margin increased 10 basis points to 16.2%, primarily due to our parts and service business, which has higher margins than new and used vehicle sales, representing a larger percentage of our total revenue for the year ended 2016 compared to the year ended 2015.\nIncome from operations during 2016 decreased by $3.8 million (1%) compared to 2015, primarily due to the $2.1 million decrease in gross profit, increases in SG&A expenses and depreciation and amortization of $2.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a $2.1 million increase in other operating income, net. Total other expenses increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to increases in floor plan interest expense and other interest expense, net of $3.2 million and $9.1 million, respectively, partially offset by a $10.6 million increase in the gain on divestitures. As a result, income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by $5.6 million (2%) to $267.8 million in 2016. The decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes, resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of $3.4 million (3%). Net income decreased by $2.0 million (1%) to $167.2 million in 2016.\nWe assess the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a\nsame store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to\nassess our performance. As such, for the following discussion, same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period.\nNew Vehicle-\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

vehicle sold. Same store new vehicle revenue increased by $31.3 million (1%) as a result of a 2% increase in revenue per new vehicle sold, partially offset by a 1% decrease in new vehicle units sold.\nU.S. new vehicle sales were 17.6 million in 2016 and, was relatively stable compared to 17.5 million in 2015. Our 1% decrease in same store unit volumes, was primarily the result of a 5% decrease in luxury units, partially offset by a 1% increase in domestic units. We attribute the decrease in luxury unit volumes to a consumer preference shift from cars to trucks, due in part to lower gas prices, which tends to favor domestic brands.\nSame store new vehicle gross profit in 2016 decreased by $12.3 million (6%), as a result of the 1% decrease in unit volumes and a 5% decrease in gross profit per new vehicle sold. New vehicle gross margin in 2016 decreased by 40 basis points to 5.2%, primarily attributable to the decrease in luxury unit volumes, which have higher margins than import and domestic vehicles, reduced manufacturer incentives and increased competition in the marketplace for import and domestic vehicles.\nUsed Vehicle-\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions, except for per vehicle data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As Reported:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicle retail revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,675.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,717.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(42.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicle wholesale revenues\n</td> <td>201.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>214.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicle revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,876.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,931.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Used vehicle retail gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>136.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>"}
