Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe provide clean, solar energy to customers at a significant savings compared to traditional utility energy. We have been selling solar energy to residential customers through a variety of offerings since we were founded in 2007. We, either directly or through one of our solar partners, install a solar energy system on a customer's home and either sell the system to the customer or, as is more often the case, sell the energy generated by the system to the customer pursuant to a lease or power purchase agreement ( PPA\u201d) with no or low upfront costs. We refer to these leases and PPAs as Customer Agreements.\u201d Following installation, a system is interconnected to the local utility grid. The home's energy usage is provided by the solar energy system, with any additional energy needs provided by the local utility. Any excess solar energy, including amounts in excess of battery storage, that is not immediately used by the customers is exported to the utility grid using a bi-directional utility net meter, and the customer generally receives a credit for the excess energy from their utility to offset future usage of utility-generated energy.\nOn October 8, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Vivint Solar, Inc. (\"Vivint Solar\") a leading full-service residential solar provider in the United States, at an estimated purchase price of $5.0 billion, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 6, 2020, by and among Sunrun, Vivint Solar and Viking Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d). Further information about the acquisition of Vivint Solar can be found in Note 3, Acquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe offer our solar service offerings both directly to the customer and through our solar partners, which include sales and installation partners, and strategic partners, which include retail partners. In addition, we sell solar energy systems directly to customers for cash. We also sell solar energy panels and other products (such as racking) to resellers. As of December 31, 2021, we provided our solar services to customers and sold solar energy panels and other products to resellers throughout the United States. More than 40% of our cumulative systems deployed are in California.\nWe compete mainly with traditional utilities. In the markets we serve, our strategy is to price the energy we sell below prevailing local retail electricity rates. As a result, the price our customers pay under our solar service offerings varies depending on the state where the customer lives, the local traditional utility that otherwise provides electricity to the customer, as well as the prices other solar energy companies charge in that region. Even within the same neighborhood, site-specific characteristics drive meaningful variability in the revenue and cost profiles of each home. Using our proprietary technology, we target homes with advantageous revenue and cost characteristics, which means we are often able to offer pricing that allows customers to save more on their energy bill while maintaining our ability to meet our targeted returns. For example, with the insights provided by our technology, we can offer competitive pricing to customers with homes that have favorable characteristics, such as roofs that allow for easy installation, high electricity consumption, or low shading, effectively passing through the cost savings we are able to achieve on these installations to the customer.\nOur ability to offer Customer Agreements depends in part on our ability to finance the purchase and installation of the solar energy systems by monetizing the resulting customer cash flows and related commercial investment tax credits ( Commercial ITCs\u201d), accelerated tax depreciation and other incentives from governments and local utilities. We monetize these incentives under tax equity investment funds, which are generally structured as non-recourse project financings. Since inception we have raised numerous tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy systems. From time to time, we may repurchase investors' interests in our tax equity investment funds after the recapture period of the relevant tax incentives. We intend to establish additional investment funds and may also use debt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our growth.\nIn addition, completing the sale and installation of a solar energy system requires many different steps including a site audit, completion of designs, permitting, installation, electrical sign-off and interconnection. Customers may cancel their Customer Agreements with us, subject to certain conditions, during this process until commencement of installation. Customer cancellation rates can change over time and vary between markets.\nThe Opportunity of Home Electrification and a Clean, Resilient Grid\nThe United States is on the precipice of a once-in-a-generation transformation of our energy system. The decarbonization of the American economy will require powering our energy supply, including our homes, appliances and automobiles, with clean energy. Sunrun's next goal and chapter of growth is to be the go-to company for clean and reliable home electrification, providing our customers with affordable renewable energy throughout their homes and our communities with a cleaner, more resilient grid.\nWe intend to pursue these opportunities on a variety of fronts. For instance, in May 2020, we announced a partnership with Ford Motor Company to be the preferred installer for Ford's Charge Station Pro and Intelligent Backup Power System, debuting with the all-electric Lightning. Under the partnership, we are co-developing Ford's Home Integration System, including the bi-directional inverter, which enables the Lightning to serve as a reliable home backup energy source by powering the home during an outage event. Through this partnership, customers in participating markets will also be provided with the opportunity to install a solar and battery system on their home, enabling them to power their household with clean, affordable energy and charge their truck with the power of the sun.\nWe also continue to pursue the development of our grid services business, creating virtual power plants that lead to a cleaner, more resilient grid. In collaboration with grid managers, we can deploy our battery systems where they will add the most value for utilities, the grid, and customers. We are actively delivering demand response and capacity services to meet operational needs in multiple geographies, and partnering with grid managers to build a more resilient electricity system that integrates the new energy technologies customers want.\nWe believe the electrification of U.S. households with renewable energy, and the accompanying development of an inter-connected, smart grid will provide a number of market opportunities beyond our traditional solar and battery storage offerings, including EV chargers, battery retrofits, re-powered or expanding systems, home energy management services, and other home electrification products. Additionally, we believe our omni-channel model and geographic reach provides us with the capabilities to execute on these opportunities in a variety of markets.\nTo further expand such future upsell and retrofit opportunities, from time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of previously installed solar systems. While we do not expect such acquisitions to represent a material portion of our growth on an annual basis, we plan to pursue such transactions opportunistically. For instance, in the third quarter, we completed a strategic transaction that added approximately 2,000 Customers and 13 MW of Networked Solar Energy Capacity.\nIn sum, we believe the electrification of the U.S. economy with renewable energy presents an unprecedented economic opportunity, as well as our country's best path to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Through these electrification opportunities and our grid services business, we aim to be the consumer brand synonymous with repowering our customers' homes with renewable energy and providing a pathway to a cleaner, healthier future.\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the U.S. economy have accelerated many of our operational initiatives to deliver best-in-class customer value and to reduce costs. We have invested in technology to streamline our installation processes, including online permitting and interconnection in many locations, enabled our entire salesforce to complete sales consultations in a virtual setting, and employed extensive use of drone technology to complete rooftop surveys. We also implemented a company-wide COVID-19 vaccine rewards campaign to encourage vaccination among team members. We believe this transition towards a digital model for many sales channels will position us well to realize sustaining reductions in customer acquisition costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy, resulting in governments and organizations implementing public health measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. With vaccine administration and adoption rising, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting such restrictions\nand guidelines accordingly. We are monitoring this fluid situation and will continue to follow official regulations to protect our employees and customers.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (and virus variants, such as Delta and Omicron) is still highly uncertain and subject to change, and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers, and our business operations generally and will take actions that we determine are necessary in order to mitigate these impacts.\nInvestment Funds\nOur Customer Agreements provide for recurring customer payments, typically over 20 or 25 years, and the related solar energy systems are generally eligible for Commercial ITCs, accelerated tax depreciation and other government or utility incentives. Our financing strategy is to monetize these benefits at a low weighted average cost of capital. This low cost of capital enables us to offer attractive pricing to our customers for the energy generated by the solar energy system on their homes. Historically, we have monetized a portion of the value created by our Customer Agreements and the related solar energy systems through investment funds. These assets are attractive to fund investors due to the long-term, recurring nature of the cash flows generated by our Customer Agreements, the high credit scores of our customers, the fact that energy is a non-discretionary good and our low loss rates. In addition, fund investors can receive attractive after-tax returns from our investment funds due to their ability to utilize Commercial ITCs, accelerated depreciation and certain government or utility incentives associated with the funds' ownership of solar energy systems.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 60 active investment funds, which are described below. We have established different types of investment funds to implement our asset monetization strategy. Depending on the nature of the investment fund, cash may be contributed to the investment fund by the investor upfront or in stages based on milestones associated with the design, construction or interconnection status of the solar energy systems. The cash contributed by the fund investor is used by the investment fund to purchase solar energy systems. The investment funds either own or enter into a master lease with a Sunrun subsidiary for the solar energy systems, Customer Agreements and associated incentives. We receive on-going cash distributions from the investment funds representing a portion of the monthly customer payments received. We use the upfront cash, as well as on-going distributions to cover our costs associated with designing, purchasing and installing the solar energy systems. In addition, we also use debt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our operations. The allocation of the economic benefits between us and the fund investor and the corresponding accounting treatment varies depending on the structure of the investment fund.\nWe currently utilize three legal structures in our investment funds, which we refer to as: (i) pass-through financing obligations, (ii) partnership flips and (iii) joint venture ( JV\u201d) inverted leases. We reflect pass-through financing obligations on our consolidated balance sheet as a pass-through financing obligation. We record the investor's interest in partnership flips or JV inverted leases (which we define collectively as consolidated joint ventures\u201d) as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests. These consolidated joint ventures are usually redeemable at our option and, in certain cases, at the investor's option. If redemption is at our option or the consolidated joint ventures are not redeemable, we record the investor's interest as a noncontrolling interest and account for the interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value ( HLBV\u201d) method. If the investor has the option to put their interest to us, we record the investor's interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at the greater of the HLBV and the redemption value.\nThe table below provides an overview of our current investment funds (dollars in millions):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Consolidated Joint Ventures </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Pass-Through Financing Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>Partnership Flip </td> <td> </td> <td>JV Inverted Lease </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidation </td> <td> </td> <td>Owner entity consolidated, tenant entity not consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>Single entity, consolidated </td> <td> </td> <td>Owner and tenant entities consolidated </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance sheet classification </td> <td> </td> <td>Pass-through financing obligation </td> <td> </td> <td>Redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>Redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from Commercial ITCs </td> <td> </td> <td>Recognized on the PTO date </td> <td> </td> <td>None </td> <td> </td> <td>None </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Method of calculating investor interest </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective interest rate method </td> <td> </td> <td>Greater of HLBV or redemption value; or pro rata </td> <td> </td> <td>Greater of HLBV or redemption value; or pro rata </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liability balance as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Noncontrolling interest balance (redeemable or otherwise) as of December 31, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,298.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor further information regarding our investment funds, including the associated risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-\"Our ability to provide our solar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in part on our ability to finance these systems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\", Note 13, Pass-Through Financing Obligations, Note 14, VIE Arrangements and Note 15, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPass-through Financing Obligations\nPass-Through Financing Obligations. In this investment fund structure, we and the fund investor each utilize separate entities to facilitate the pass-through of the Commercial ITC or U.S. Treasury grants to the fund investors. We contribute solar energy systems to an owner\u201d entity in exchange for interests in the owner entity, and the fund investors contribute cash to a tenant\u201d entity in exchange for interests in the tenant entity.\nUnder our pass-through financing obligation structure, in accordance with the provisions of FASB, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 ( ASC 810\u201d) Consolidation, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the owner entity, and accordingly, we consolidate that entity. We have also determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the tenant entity, and accordingly, we do not consolidate that entity.\nIn this investment fund structure, the investors make a series of large up-front payments as well as, in some instances, subsequent smaller quarterly lease payments through their respective tenant entity to the corresponding owner entity in exchange for the assignment of cash flows from Customer Agreements and certain other benefits associated with the Customer Agreements and related solar energy systems. We account for the payments from investors as borrowings by recording the proceeds received as financing obligations. The financing obligation is reduced over a period of approximately 22 years, or over 7 years in the case of one fund, by customer payments under the Customer Agreements, U.S. Treasury grants (where applicable); and proceeds from the contracted resale of SRECs as they are received by the investor. In addition, funds paid for the Commercial ITC value upfront are initially recorded as a refund liability and recognized as revenue as the associated solar system reaches permission to operate (\"PTO\").\nWe account for these investment funds in our consolidated financial statements as if we have not assigned the Customer Agreement to the investor, and we record on our consolidated financial statements activities arising from the Customer Agreements and any related U.S. Treasury grants, Commercial ITCs monetized as part of the upfront payments received from the investor and SREC sales. The interest charge on our pass-through financing obligations is imputed at the inception of the fund based on the effective interest rate in the arrangement giving rise to the obligation and is updated prospectively as appropriate.\nIn certain arrangements, we agree to defer a portion of the up-front payments by arranging a loan between one of our indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries to a subsidiary of the investor's tenant entity.\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\nPartnership Flips. Under partnership flip structures, we and our fund investors contribute cash into a partnership entity. The partnership uses the cash to acquire solar energy systems developed by us with signed Customer Agreements. Each fund investor receives a rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis, which varies by investment fund. Prior to the fund investor receiving its contractual rate of return or for a time period specified in the contractual arrangements, the fund investor receives a significant portion of the value attributable to customer payments, a majority of the accelerated tax depreciation and substantially all of the Commercial ITCs. After the fund investor receives its contractual rate of return or after the specified time period, we receive substantially all of the value attributable to the remaining customer payments and SREC sales.\nIncluded within the Partnership Flips is the project equity financing we entered into in December 2016. We pooled and transferred our interests in certain financing funds into a special purpose entity ( SPE\u201d) with a new investor. We did not recognize a gain or loss on the transfer of its interests in the financing funds and continue to consolidate the financing funds. The SPE's assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the investor has no recourse to our other assets.\nUnder our partnership flip structures, we have determined that we control the partnership entity which is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record the investor's interest as either noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInverted Leases. Under our inverted lease structure, we and the fund investor set up a multi-tiered investment vehicle that is comprised of two partnership entities which facilitate the pass through of the tax benefits to the fund investors. In this structure we contribute solar energy systems to an owner\u201d partnership entity in exchange for interests in the owner partnership and the fund investors contribute cash to a tenant\u201d partnership in exchange for interests in the tenant partnership, which in turn makes an investment in the owner partnership entity in exchange for interests in the owner partnership. The owner partnership uses the cash contributions received from the tenant partnership to purchase systems from us and/or fund installation of such systems. Under our existing JV inverted lease structure, a substantial portion of the value generated by the solar energy systems is provided to the fund investor for a specified period of time, which is generally based upon the period of time corresponding to the expiry of the recapture period associated with the Commercial ITCs. After that point in time, we receive substantially all of the value attributable to the long-term recurring customer payments and the other incentives. Generally, under the terms of each agreement, the investors' contributions include the value of Commercial ITCs earned or grants to be received by the fund investor. Any other proceeds are allocated on a pro rata basis to the fund investor and us in accordance with their ownership percentages. Since Sunrun has the power to control both the owner and tenant entities, both entities are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe also have one JV inverted lease fund whereby we have a pro rata interest in the entity and we account for the noncontrolling interest's share of income on a pro rata basis. Accordingly, the noncontrolling interest of this fund is carried on our balance sheet at the cumulative amount of capital contributions, reduced by cumulative distributions paid to the investor, as well as the pro rata share of their income. Under our JV inverted lease structure, we have determined that we control each VIE, and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record investor's interest as a noncontrolling interest or redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nFor all of our partnership flips and JV inverted leases, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is carried on our balance sheet at the greater of the redemption value or the amount calculated under the HLBV method. The HLBV method estimates the amount that, if the fund's assets were hypothetically sold at their book value, the investor would be entitled to receive according to the liquidation waterfall in the partnership agreement.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Some of our key operating metrics are estimates that are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each of these estimates, we caution you that these estimates are based on a combination of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate over time. Any inaccuracies could be material to our actual results when compared to our calculations. Please see the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Furthermore, other companies may calculate these metrics differently than we do now or in the future, which would reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\u2022Networked Solar Energy Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed on the roof, subject to final inspection; (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of acquisitions of installed systems), or (iii) for multi-family and any other systems that have reached NTP, measured on the percentage of the project that has been completed based on expected project cost. Systems that have met these criteria are considered to be deployed.\n\u2022Gross Earning Assets is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n\u25e6Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 5%) during the initial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at 5%) we expect to receive from Subscribers in future periods, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from state incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utility or grid operators.\n\u25e6Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system's activation (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer's contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis and the rate is initially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n\u25e6Subscribers represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as deployments through the measurement date.\n\u2022Customers represent the cumulative number of deployments, from our inception through the measurement date.\nGross Earning Assets is forecasted as of a specific date. It is forward-looking, and we use judgment in developing the assumptions used to calculate it. Factors that could impact Gross Earning Assets include, but are not limited to, customer payment defaults, or declines in utility rates or early termination of a contract in certain circumstances, including prior to installation.\nThe definitions of Gross Earning Assets, Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period, and Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period use a discount rate of 5%; whereas the definitions used previously in our periodic reports prior to December 31, 2020 used a discount rate of 6%.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates, and in other instances, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period-to-period. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. Our future financial statements will be affected to the extent that our actual results materially differ from these estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe believe that policies associated with our principles of consolidation, revenue recognition, goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, provision for income taxes, business combinations and calculation of noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests have the greatest impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity. However, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling financial interests. We consolidate any VIE of which we are the primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that has (1) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We evaluate our relationships with our VIEs on an ongoing basis to determine whether we continue to be the primary beneficiary. Our financial statements reflect the assets and liabilities of VIEs that we consolidate. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. For further information regarding consolidation of our investment funds, see -Investment Funds\u201d above.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.\nCustomer Agreements and Incentives Revenue. Customer agreements and incentives revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from our Customer Agreements and sales of Commercial ITCs and SRECs to third parties.\nWe begin to recognize revenue from a Customer Agreement when PTO for the applicable solar energy system is given by the local utility company or on the date daily operation commences if utility approval is not required. For Customer Agreements that include a fixed fee per month which entitles the customer to any and all electricity generated by the system, we recognize revenue evenly over the time that we satisfy our performance obligations over the initial term of Customer Agreements. For Customer Agreements that charge a fixed price per kilowatt hour, revenue is recognized based on the actual amount of power generated at rates specified under the contracts. Customer Agreements typically have an initial term of 20 or 25 years. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis.\nWe also apply for and receive SRECs associated with the energy generated by our solar energy systems and sell them to third parties in certain jurisdictions. SREC revenue is estimated net of any variable consideration related to possible liquidated damages if we were to deliver fewer SRECs than contractually committed, and is generally recognized upon delivery of the SRECs to the counterparty.\nCertain upfront payments related to Customer Agreements and SRECs are deemed to have a financing component, and therefore increase both revenue and interest expense by the same amount over the term of the related agreement. The additional revenue is included in the total transaction price to be recorded over the term of the agreement and is recognized based on the timing of the delivery. The interest expense is recognized based upon an amortization schedule which typically decreases throughout the term of the related agreement.\nFor pass-through financing obligation funds, the value attributable to the Commercial ITCs is recognized in the period a solar system is granted PTO, at which point we have met our obligation to the investor. The Commercial ITCs are subject to recapture under the Internal Revenue Code ( Code\u201d) if the underlying solar energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in ownership within five years of its placed-in-service date. The recapture amount decreases on the anniversary of the PTO date. We have not historically incurred a material recapture of Commercial ITCs, and do not expect to experience a material recapture of Commercial ITCs in the future.\nConsideration from customers is considered variable due to the performance guarantee under Customer Agreements and liquidated damage provisions under SREC contracts in the event minimum deliveries are not achieved. Customer Agreements with a performance guarantee provide a credit to the customer if the system's cumulative production, as measured on various PTO anniversary dates, is below our guarantee of a specified minimum. Revenue is recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur.\nSolar Energy Systems and Product Sales. Solar energy systems sales are comprised of revenue from the sale of solar energy systems directly to customers. We generally recognize revenue from solar energy systems sold to customers when the solar energy system passes inspection by the authority having jurisdiction, which inspection generally occurs after installation but prior to PTO, at which time we have met the performance obligation in the contract. For solar energy system sales that include delivery obligations up until interconnection to the local power grid with permission to operate, we recognize revenue at PTO. Certain solar energy systems sold to customers include fees for extended warranty and maintenance services. These fees are recognized over the life of the service agreement.\nProduct sales revenue consists of revenue from the sale of solar panels, inverters, racking systems, roof repair, and other solar energy products sold to resellers, as well as the sale of customer leads to third parties, including our partners and other solar providers. Product sales revenue is recognized when control is transferred, generally upon shipment, or as services are delivered. Customer lead revenue is recognized at the time the lead is delivered.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. We have determined that we operate as one reporting unit and our goodwill is tested for impairment at the enterprise level. We perform our annual impairment test of goodwill on October 1 of each fiscal year or whenever events or circumstances change or occur that would indicate that goodwill might be impaired. When assessing goodwill for impairment, we use qualitative and if necessary, quantitative methods in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Goodwill. We also consider our enterprise value and if necessary, a discounted cash flow model, which involves assumptions and estimates, including our future financial performance, weighted average cost of capital and interpretation of currently enacted tax laws.\nCircumstances that could indicate impairment and require us to perform a quantitative impairment test include a significant decline in our financial results, a significant decline in our enterprise value relative to our net book value, a sustained decline in our stock price, or an unanticipated change in competition or our market share and a significant change in our strategic plans.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including solar energy systems and definite-lived intangible assets, are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review would include significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset group to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. If the useful life is shorter than originally estimated, we amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes, net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. A valuation allowance is provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, estimates of future taxable income, reversing taxable temporary differences, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. We recognize the effect of tax rate and law changes on deferred taxes in the reporting period in which the legislation is enacted.\nWe sell solar energy systems to the investment funds. As the investment funds are consolidated by us, the gain on the sale of the solar energy systems is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements. However, this gain is recognized for tax reporting purposes. We account for the income tax consequences of these intra-entity transfers, both current and deferred, as a component of income tax expense and deferred tax liability, net during the period in which the transfers occur.\nWe account for investment tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense in the year in which the credits arise.\nWe determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nOur policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, within the provision for taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase price to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to the solar energy systems acquired as part of our acquisition of Vivint Solar.\nSignificant estimates in valuing certain tangible and intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.\nSee Note 3, Acquisition to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nOur noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent fund investors' interests in the net assets of certain investment funds, which we consolidate, that we have entered into in order to finance the costs of solar energy facilities under Customer Agreements. We have determined that the provisions in the contractual arrangements of the investment funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements, which gives rise to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We have further determined that for all but two of these arrangements, the appropriate methodology for attributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV method.\nAttributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests under the HLBV method requires the use of various inputs to calculate the amounts that fund investors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation. Changes in these inputs, including change in tax rates, can have a significant impact on the amount that fund investors would receive upon a hypothetical liquidation.\nWe classify certain noncontrolling interests with redemption features that are not solely within our control outside of permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are reported using the greater of their carrying value at each reporting date as determined by the HLBV method or their estimated redemption value in each reporting period. Estimating the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates such as projected future cash flows at the time the redemption feature can be exercised.\nWe determine the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by deducting from net loss, the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in these funds. The net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represents the fund investors' allocable share in the results of operations of these investment funds. For these funds, we have determined that the provisions in the contractual arrangements represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements, where the allocations to the partners sometimes differ from the stated ownership percentages. We have further determined that, for these arrangements, the appropriate methodology for attributing income and loss to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests each period is a balance sheet approach using the HLBV method. Under the HLBV method, the amounts of income and loss attributed to the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of operations reflect changes in the amounts the fund investors would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual provisions of these funds, assuming the net assets of the respective investment funds were liquidated at the carrying value determined in accordance with GAAP. The fund investors' interest in the results of operations of these investment funds is initially determined by calculating the difference in the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests' claim under the HLBV method at the start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any contributions and distributions between the fund and the fund investors and subject to the redemption provisions in certain funds.\nResults of Operations\nThe results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 in Item

The $292.7 million increase in Revenue from Customer Agreements was primarily due to both an increase in solar energy systems under Customer Agreements being added to our fleet upon the acquisition of Vivint Solar in October 2020, as well as new systems placed in service in 2021 and a full year of revenue recognized in 2021 for systems placed in service in 2020 versus only a partial amount of such revenue related to the period in which the assets were in service in 2020. Revenue from incentives, which primarily consists of the sale of SRECs, increased by $49.7 million when compared to the prior year due to the timing of sales and market prices.\nSolar Energy Systems and Product Sales. Revenue from solar energy systems sales increased by $201.4 million compared to the prior year primarily due to solar energy systems sales from an expanded sales force following the acquisition of Vivint Solar, as well as increased demand through retail partners. Product sales increased by $143.9 million compared to the prior year primarily due to lower volume of wholesale products sold in 2020, which was impacted by COVID-19, and customers' reduced purchases in 2020 after purchasing safe harbor materials in 2019 for use in 2020.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of customer agreements and incentives </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>699,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>385,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>313,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of solar energy systems and product sales </td> <td> </td> <td>666,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>357,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>308,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>622,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>352,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>270,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>23,165 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expense </td> <td> </td> <td>259,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,573) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>5,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,276,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,387,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>888,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Customer Agreements and Incentives. The $313.5 million increase in Cost of customer agreements and incentives was primarily due to the increase in solar energy systems added to our fleet upon the acquisition of Vivint Solar in October 2020, as well as new systems placed in service in 2021, plus a full year of costs recognized in 2021 for systems placed in service in 2020 versus only a partial amount of such expenses related to the period in which the assets were in service in 2020.\nThe Cost of customer agreements and incentives increased to 85% of customer agreements and incentives revenue during 2021, from 80% during 2020. The increase was impacted by the acquisition of Vivint Solar, which resulted in an increase in depreciation expense of approximately $107.6 million related to the step up in solar systems fair value upon the acquisition of Vivint Solar.\nCost of Solar Energy Systems and Product Sales. There was a $308.5 million increase in Cost of solar energy systems and product sales which was primarily due to the corresponding net increase in the solar energy systems and product sales discussed above.\nSales and Marketing Expense. The $270.7 million increase in Sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to increases in headcount, which were primarily driven by the acquisition of Vivint Solar in October 2020, resulting in higher employee compensation. Additionally, we spent more in costs to acquire customers through our sales lead generating partners in 2021 compared to the prior year. Partially offsetting these increases in Sales and marketing expense is an $8.9 million decrease in non-recurring and restructuring costs incurred compared to the prior year which had $9.6 million in such costs following the acquisition of Vivint Solar. Included in sales and marketing expense were $23.3 million and $14.4 million of amortization of costs to obtain Customer Agreements for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expense. The $3.6 million increase in Research and development expense was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Vivint Solar, resulting in an increase in headcount driving higher employee compensation costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense. The $7.6 million decrease in General and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease of $16.3 million in nonrecurring (primarily acquisition-related) costs incurred during 2021, partially offset by the acquisition of Vivint Solar, which resulted in an increase in headcount driving higher employee compensation and consulting costs.\nNon-Operating Expenses\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(327,700) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(230,601) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(97,099) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>22,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>176 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total interest and other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(305,072) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(222,413) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(82,659) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net. The increase in Interest expense, net of $97.1 million included $73.0 million for a full year of interest expense associated with the debt acquired with Vivint Solar. The remaining increase is primarily related to additional non-recourse debt entered into in 2021. Included in net interest expense is $26.3 million and $24.8 million of non-cash interest recognized under Customer Agreements that have a significant financing component for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther income, net. The increase in other income, net of $14.4 million relates primarily to gains on derivatives recognized in 2021, with no such comparable activity in 2020.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(60,573) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in Income tax benefit of $69.8 million primarily relates to an increase in noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interests, an increase in valuation allowance on certain federal and state tax credits and net operating losses, and decrease in stock based compensation that was offset by an increase in tax benefit related to a higher pre-tax loss.\nGiven our net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2021, we do not expect to pay income tax, including in connection with our 2021 income tax provision, until our net operating losses are fully utilized. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $720.7 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, which will begin to expire in 2028 for federal purposes and in 2024 for state purposes. In addition, federal and certain state net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 total $1.4 billion and $198.7 million, respectively, and have indefinite carryover periods and do not expire.\nNet Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(901,107) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(453,554) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(447,553) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests was primarily the result of an addition of six new investment funds since December 31, 2020, for which the HLBV method was used in determining the amount of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, as well as $66.4 million of net loss related Vivint Solar's noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Redeemable noncontrolling interests generally allocates more loss to the noncontrolling interest in the first several years after fund formation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash of $617.6 million, which consisted of cash held in checking and savings accounts with financial institutions. We finance our operations mainly through a variety of financing fund arrangements that we have formed with fund investors, cash generated from our sources of revenue and borrowings from secured credit facilities arrangements with syndicates of banks and from secured, long-term non-recourse loan arrangements. In 2021, we received $1.8 billion of new commitments on secured credit facilities arrangements with syndicates of banks and $888.7 million of commitments from secured, long-term non-recourse loan arrangements. Our principal uses of cash are funding our business, including the costs of acquisition and installation of solar energy systems, satisfaction of our obligations under our debt instruments and other working capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings of $211.1 million on our $250.0 million corporate bank line of credit maturing in April 2022, however, in January 2022, we retired this corporate bank line of credit, repaid the outstanding balance, and replaced it with a $425.0 million credit facility maturing in January 2025. Additionally, we have purchase commitments, which have the ability to be canceled without significant penalties, with multiple suppliers to purchase $558.0 million of photovoltaic modules, inverters and batteries by the end of 2022. In January 2021, we issued $400.0 million of convertible senior notes with a maturity date of February 1, 2026, for net proceeds of approximately $389.0 million. Our business model requires substantial outside financing arrangements to grow the business and facilitate the deployment of additional solar energy systems. The solar energy systems that are operational are expected to generate a positive return rate over the term of the Customer Agreement, typically 20 or 25 years. However, in order to grow, we will continue to be dependent on financing from outside parties. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms if and when needed, we may be required to reduce planned spending, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. While there can be no assurances, we anticipate raising additional required capital from new and existing investors. We believe our cash, investment fund commitments and available borrowings as further described below will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated cash flow data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(817,186) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(317,972) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(1,686,185) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(497,789) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,645,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,160,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>142,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>344,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nDuring 2021, we used $817.2 million in net cash from operating activities. The driver of our operating cash inflow consists of payments received from customers as well as incentives. The driver of our operating cash outflow consists of the costs of our revenue, as well as sales, marketing and general and administrative costs. During 2021, our operating cash outflows were $332.2 million from our net loss excluding non-cash and non-operating items. Changes in working capital resulted in a net cash outflow of $485.1 million.\nDuring 2020, we used $318.0 million in net cash from operating activities. The driver of our operating cash inflow consists of payments received from customers as well as incentives. The driver of our operating cash outflow consists of the costs of our revenue, as well as sales, marketing and general and administrative costs. During 2020, our operating cash outflows were $239.0 million from our net loss excluding non-cash and non-operating items. Changes in working capital resulted in a net cash outflow of $79.0 million.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring 2021, we used $1.7 billion in cash in investing activities. The majority was used to design, acquire and install solar energy systems and components under our long-term Customer Agreements.\nDuring 2020, we used $497.8 million in cash in investing activities. The majority was used to design, acquire and install solar energy systems and components under our long-term Customer Agreements. During 2020, we contributed $65.4 million as an investment in a home electrification venture. Offsetting these outflows was $537.2 of cash and restricted cash provided by the acquisition of Vivint Solar on October 8, 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring 2021, we generated $2.6 billion from financing activities. This was primarily driven by $1.0 billion in net proceeds from fund investors, $1.6 billion in net proceeds from debt, $36.1 million in net proceeds from stock-based awards activity, offset by $42.0 million in acquisition of noncontrollling interests.\nDuring 2020, we generated $1.2 billion from financing activities. This was primarily driven by $705.0 million in net proceeds from fund investors, $329.1 million in net proceeds from debt and $48.7 million in net proceeds from stock-based awards activity, offset by $2.7 million in acquisition of noncontrolling interests. Additionally, during 2020, we received $75.0 million from the sale and issuance of shares pursuant to a subscription agreement with SK E&S Co., Ltd.\nDebt, Equity, and Financing Fund Commitments\nDebt Instruments\nFor a discussion of the terms and conditions of debt instruments and changes thereof in the period, refer to Note 11, Indebtedness, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nConvertible Senior Notes Offering\nOn January 25, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers (the Purchasers\u201d), to issue and sell $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Notes were sold to the Purchasers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. In addition, we granted the Purchasers an option to purchase, during a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the Notes were first issued, up to an additional $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes on the same terms and conditions. The Purchasers exercised their option in full on January 26, 2021. The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes issued on January 28, 2021 (after deducting the Purchasers' discount and estimated offering expenses) was approximately $389.0 million.\nOn January 28, 2021, we entered into an Indenture (the Indenture\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the Trustee\u201d), pursuant to which we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the notes will not accrete. The Notes may bear special interest under specified circumstances relating to our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under the Indenture or if the Notes are not freely tradable as required by the Indenture. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased by us, redeemed by us or converted pursuant to their terms.\nIn connection with the offering of the Notes, on January 25, 2021 and January 26, 2021, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with Credit Suisse Capital LLC, represented by Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Barclays Bank PLC, through its agent Barclays Capital Inc., and Royal Bank of Canada, represented by RBC Capital Markets, LLC (the Capped Calls\u201d). The Capped Calls each have an initial strike price of approximately $117.91 per share, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the Notes. The Capped Calls have initial cap prices of $157.22 per share. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the common stock upon any conversion of Notes\nand/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be, in the event the market price per share of common stock, as measured under the Capped Calls, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call, with such offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the Capped Calls, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Calls, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price. We used approximately $28.0 million from the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Notes to purchase the Capped Calls. The final components of the Capped Calls are scheduled to expire on January 29, 2026.\nInvestment Fund Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had committed and available capital of approximately $288.7 million that may only be used to purchase and install solar energy systems. We intend to establish new investment funds in the future, and we may also use debt, equity or other financing strategies to finance our business.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "The report discusses the financial condition and operations of a company engaged in providing clean, solar energy to residential customers.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe provide clean, solar energy to customers at a significant savings compared to traditional utility energy. We have been selling solar energy to residential customers through a variety of offerings since we were founded in 2007. We, either directly or through one of our solar partners, install a solar energy system on a customer's home and either sell the system to the customer or, as is more often the case, sell the energy generated by the system to the customer pursuant to a lease or power purchase agreement ( PPA\u201d) with no or low upfront costs. We refer to these leases and PPAs as Customer Agreements.\u201d Following installation, a system is interconnected to the local utility grid. The home's energy usage is provided by the solar energy system, with any additional energy needs provided by the local utility. Any excess solar energy, including amounts in excess of battery storage, that is not immediately used by the customers is exported to the utility grid using a bi-directional utility net meter, and the customer generally receives a credit for the excess energy from their utility to offset future usage of utility-generated energy.\nOn October 8, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Vivint Solar, Inc. (\"Vivint Solar\") a leading full-service residential solar provider in the United States, at an estimated purchase price of $5.0 billion, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 6, 2020, by and among Sunrun, Vivint Solar and Viking Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d). Further information about the acquisition of Vivint Solar can be found in Note 3, Acquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe offer our solar service offerings both directly to the customer and through our solar partners, which include sales and installation partners, and strategic partners, which include retail partners. In addition, we sell solar energy systems directly to customers for cash. We also sell solar energy panels and other products (such as racking) to resellers. As of December 31, 2021, we provided our solar services to customers and sold solar energy panels and other products to resellers throughout the United States. More than 40% of our cumulative systems deployed are in California.\nWe compete mainly with traditional utilities. In the markets we serve, our strategy is to price the energy we sell below prevailing local retail electricity rates. As a result, the price our customers pay under our solar service offerings varies depending on the state where the customer lives, the local traditional utility that otherwise provides electricity to the customer, as well as the prices other solar energy companies charge in that region. Even within the same neighborhood, site-specific characteristics drive meaningful variability in the revenue and cost profiles of each home. Using our proprietary technology, we target homes with advantageous revenue and cost characteristics, which means we are often able to offer pricing that allows customers to save more on their energy bill while maintaining our ability to meet our targeted returns. For example, with the insights provided by our technology, we can offer competitive pricing to customers with homes that have favorable characteristics, such as roofs that allow for easy installation, high electricity consumption, or low shading, effectively passing through the cost savings we are able to achieve on these installations to the customer.\nOur ability to offer Customer Agreements depends in part on our ability to finance the purchase and installation of the solar energy systems by monetizing the resulting customer cash flows and related commercial investment tax credits ( Commercial ITCs\u201d), accelerated tax depreciation and other incentives from governments and local utilities. We monetize these incentives under tax equity investment funds, which are generally structured as non-recourse project financings. Since inception we have raised numerous tax equity investment funds to finance the installation of solar energy systems. From time to time, we may repurchase investors' interests in our tax equity investment funds after the recapture period of the relevant tax incentives. We intend to establish additional investment funds and may also use debt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our growth.\nIn addition, completing the sale and installation of a solar energy system requires many different steps including a site audit, completion of designs, permitting, installation, electrical sign-off and interconnection. Customers may cancel their Customer Agreements with us, subject to certain conditions, during this process until commencement of installation. Customer cancellation rates can change over time and vary between markets.\nThe Opportunity of Home Electrification and a Clean, Resilient Grid\nThe United States is on the precipice of a once-in-a-generation transformation of our energy system. The decarbonization of the American economy will require powering our energy supply, including our homes, appliances and automobiles, with clean energy. Sunrun's next goal and chapter of growth is to be the go-to company for clean and reliable home electrification, providing our customers with affordable renewable energy throughout their homes and our communities with a cleaner, more resilient grid.\nWe intend to pursue these opportunities on a variety of fronts. For instance, in May 2020, we announced a partnership with Ford Motor Company to be the preferred installer for Ford's Charge Station Pro and Intelligent Backup Power System, debuting with the all-electric Lightning. Under the partnership, we are co-developing Ford's Home Integration System, including the bi-directional inverter, which enables the Lightning to serve as a reliable home backup energy source by powering the home during an outage event. Through this partnership, customers in participating markets will also be provided with the opportunity to install a solar and battery system on their home, enabling them to power their household with clean, affordable energy and charge their truck with the power of the sun.\nWe also continue to pursue the development of our grid services business, creating virtual power plants that lead to a cleaner, more resilient grid. In collaboration with grid managers, we can deploy our battery systems where they will add the most value for utilities, the grid, and customers. We are actively delivering demand response and capacity services to meet operational needs in multiple geographies, and partnering with grid managers to build a more resilient electricity system that integrates the new energy technologies customers want.\nWe believe the electrification of U.S. households with renewable energy, and the accompanying development of an inter-connected, smart grid will provide a number of market opportunities beyond our traditional solar and battery storage offerings, including EV chargers, battery retrofits, re-powered or expanding systems, home energy management services, and other home electrification products. Additionally, we believe our omni-channel model and geographic reach provides us with the capabilities to execute on these opportunities in a variety of markets.\nTo further expand such future upsell and retrofit opportunities, from time to time, we may pursue acquisitions of previously installed solar systems. While we do not expect such acquisitions to represent a material portion of our growth on an annual basis, we plan to pursue such transactions opportunistically. For instance, in the third quarter, we completed a strategic transaction that added approximately 2,000 Customers and 13 MW of Networked Solar Energy Capacity.\nIn sum, we believe the electrification of the U.S. economy with renewable energy presents an unprecedented economic opportunity, as well as our country's best path to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. Through these electrification opportunities and our grid services business, we aim to be the consumer brand synonymous with repowering our customers' homes with renewable energy and providing a pathway to a cleaner, healthier future.\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the U.S. economy have accelerated many of our operational initiatives to deliver best-in-class customer value and to reduce costs. We have invested in technology to streamline our installation processes, including online permitting and interconnection in many locations, enabled our entire salesforce to complete sales consultations in a virtual setting, and employed extensive use of drone technology to complete rooftop surveys. We also implemented a company-wide COVID-19 vaccine rewards campaign to encourage vaccination among team members. We believe this transition towards a digital model for many sales channels will position us well to realize sustaining reductions in customer acquisition costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy, resulting in governments and organizations implementing public health measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. With vaccine administration and adoption rising, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting such restrictions\nand guidelines accordingly. We are monitoring this fluid situation and will continue to follow official regulations to protect our employees and customers.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (and virus variants, such as Delta and Omicron) is still highly uncertain and subject to change, and we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, operations or the global economy as a whole. We will continue to monitor developments affecting our workforce, our customers, and our business operations generally and will take actions that we determine are necessary in order to mitigate these impacts.\nInvestment Funds\nOur Customer Agreements provide for recurring customer payments, typically over 20 or 25 years, and the related solar energy systems are generally eligible for Commercial ITCs, accelerated tax depreciation and other government or utility incentives. Our financing strategy is to monetize these benefits at a low weighted average cost of capital. This low cost of capital enables us to offer attractive pricing to our customers for the energy generated by the solar energy system on their homes. Historically, we have monetized a portion of the value created by our Customer Agreements and the related solar energy systems through investment funds. These assets are attractive to fund investors due to the long-term, recurring nature of the cash flows generated by our Customer Agreements, the high credit scores of our customers, the fact that energy is a non-discretionary good and our low loss rates. In addition, fund investors can receive attractive after-tax returns from our investment funds due to their ability to utilize Commercial ITCs, accelerated depreciation and certain government or utility incentives associated with the funds' ownership of solar energy systems.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 60 active investment funds, which are described below. We have established different types of investment funds to implement our asset monetization strategy. Depending on the nature of the investment fund, cash may be contributed to the investment fund by the investor upfront or in stages based on milestones associated with the design, construction or interconnection status of the solar energy systems. The cash contributed by the fund investor is used by the investment fund to purchase solar energy systems. The investment funds either own or enter into a master lease with a Sunrun subsidiary for the solar energy systems, Customer Agreements and associated incentives. We receive on-going cash distributions from the investment funds representing a portion of the monthly customer payments received. We use the upfront cash, as well as on-going distributions to cover our costs associated with designing, purchasing and installing the solar energy systems. In addition, we also use debt, equity and other financing strategies to fund our operations. The allocation of the economic benefits between us and the fund investor and the corresponding accounting treatment varies depending on the structure of the investment fund.\nWe currently utilize three legal structures in our investment funds, which we refer to as: (i) pass-through financing obligations, (ii) partnership flips and (iii) joint venture ( JV\u201d) inverted leases. We reflect pass-through financing obligations on our consolidated balance sheet as a pass-through financing obligation. We record the investor's interest in partnership flips or JV inverted leases (which we define collectively as consolidated joint ventures\u201d) as noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests. These consolidated joint ventures are usually redeemable at our option and, in certain cases, at the investor's option. If redemption is at our option or the consolidated joint ventures are not redeemable, we record the investor's interest as a noncontrolling interest and account for the interest using the hypothetical liquidation at book value ( HLBV\u201d) method. If the investor has the option to put their interest to us, we record the investor's interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest at the greater of the HLBV and the redemption value.\nThe table below provides an overview of our current investment funds (dollars in millions):\n\nFor further information regarding our investment funds, including the associated risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-\"Our ability to provide our solar service offerings to customers on an economically viable basis depends in part on our ability to finance these systems with fund investors who seek particular tax and other benefits.\", Note 13, Pass-Through Financing Obligations, Note 14, VIE Arrangements and Note 15, Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPass-through Financing Obligations\nPass-Through Financing Obligations. In this investment fund structure, we and the fund investor each utilize separate entities to facilitate the pass-through of the Commercial ITC or U.S. Treasury grants to the fund investors. We contribute solar energy systems to an owner\u201d entity in exchange for interests in the owner entity, and the fund investors contribute cash to a tenant\u201d entity in exchange for interests in the tenant entity.\nUnder our pass-through financing obligation structure, in accordance with the provisions of FASB, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 ( ASC 810\u201d) Consolidation, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the owner entity, and accordingly, we consolidate that entity. We have also determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the tenant entity, and accordingly, we do not consolidate that entity.\nIn this investment fund structure, the investors make a series of large up-front payments as well as, in some instances, subsequent smaller quarterly lease payments through their respective tenant entity to the corresponding owner entity in exchange for the assignment of cash flows from Customer Agreements and certain other benefits associated with the Customer Agreements and related solar energy systems. We account for the payments from investors as borrowings by recording the proceeds received as financing obligations. The financing obligation is reduced over a period of approximately 22 years, or over 7 years in the case of one fund, by customer payments under the Customer Agreements, U.S. Treasury grants (where applicable); and proceeds from the contracted resale of SRECs as they are received by the investor. In addition, funds paid for the Commercial ITC value upfront are initially recorded as a refund liability and recognized as revenue as the associated solar system reaches permission to operate (\"PTO\").\nWe account for these investment funds in our consolidated financial statements as if we have not assigned the Customer Agreement to the investor, and we record on our consolidated financial statements activities arising from the Customer Agreements and any related U.S. Treasury grants, Commercial ITCs monetized as part of the upfront payments received from the investor and SREC sales. The interest charge on our pass-through financing obligations is imputed at the inception of the fund based on the effective interest rate in the arrangement giving rise to the obligation and is updated prospectively as appropriate.\nIn certain arrangements, we agree to defer a portion of the up-front payments by arranging a loan between one of our indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries to a subsidiary of the investor's tenant entity.\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\nPartnership Flips. Under partnership flip structures, we and our fund investors contribute cash into a partnership entity. The partnership uses the cash to acquire solar energy systems developed by us with signed Customer Agreements. Each fund investor receives a rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis, which varies by investment fund. Prior to the fund investor receiving its contractual rate of return or for a time period specified in the contractual arrangements, the fund investor receives a significant portion of the value attributable to customer payments, a majority of the accelerated tax depreciation and substantially all of the Commercial ITCs. After the fund investor receives its contractual rate of return or after the specified time period, we receive substantially all of the value attributable to the remaining customer payments and SREC sales.\nIncluded within the Partnership Flips is the project equity financing we entered into in December 2016. We pooled and transferred our interests in certain financing funds into a special purpose entity ( SPE\u201d) with a new investor. We did not recognize a gain or loss on the transfer of its interests in the financing funds and continue to consolidate the financing funds. The SPE's assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the investor has no recourse to our other assets.\nUnder our partnership flip structures, we have determined that we control the partnership entity which is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record the investor's interest as either noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInverted Leases. Under our inverted lease structure, we and the fund investor set up a multi-tiered investment vehicle that is comprised of two partnership entities which facilitate the pass through of the tax benefits to the fund investors. In this structure we contribute solar energy systems to an owner\u201d partnership entity in exchange for interests in the owner partnership and the fund investors contribute cash to a tenant\u201d partnership in exchange for interests in the tenant partnership, which in turn makes an investment in the owner partnership entity in exchange for interests in the owner partnership. The owner partnership uses the cash contributions received from the tenant partnership to purchase systems from us and/or fund installation of such systems. Under our existing JV inverted lease structure, a substantial portion of the value generated by the solar energy systems is provided to the fund investor for a specified period of time, which is generally based upon the period of time corresponding to the expiry of the recapture period associated with the Commercial ITCs. After that point in time, we receive substantially all of the value attributable to the long-term recurring customer payments and the other incentives. Generally, under the terms of each agreement, the investors' contributions include the value of Commercial ITCs earned or grants to be received by the fund investor. Any other proceeds are allocated on a pro rata basis to the fund investor and us in accordance with their ownership percentages. Since Sunrun has the power to control both the owner and tenant entities, both entities are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe also have one JV inverted lease fund whereby we have a pro rata interest in the entity and we account for the noncontrolling interest's share of income on a pro rata basis. Accordingly, the noncontrolling interest of this fund is carried on our balance sheet at the cumulative amount of capital contributions, reduced by cumulative distributions paid to the investor, as well as the pro rata share of their income. Under our JV inverted lease structure, we have determined that we control each VIE, and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record investor's interest as a noncontrolling interest or redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nFor all of our partnership flips and JV inverted leases, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is carried on our balance sheet at the greater of the redemption value or the amount calculated under the HLBV method. The HLBV method estimates the amount that, if the fund's assets were hypothetically sold at their book value, the investor would be entitled to receive according to the liquidation waterfall in the partnership agreement.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Some of our key operating metrics are estimates that are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each of these estimates, we caution you that these estimates are based on a combination of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate over time. Any inaccuracies could be material to our actual results when compared to our calculations. Please see the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Furthermore, other companies may calculate these metrics differently than we do now or in the future, which would reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\u2022Networked Solar Energy Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed on the roof, subject to final inspection; (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of acquisitions of installed systems), or (iii) for multi-family and any other systems that have reached NTP, measured on the percentage of the project that has been completed based on expected project cost. Systems that have met these criteria are considered to be deployed.\n\u2022Gross Earning Assets is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n\u25e6Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 5%) during the initial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at 5%) we expect to receive from Subscribers in future periods, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from state incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utility or grid operators.\n\u25e6Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system's activation (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer's contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis and the rate is initially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n\u25e6Subscribers represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as deployments through the measurement date.\n\u2022Customers represent the cumulative number of deployments, from our inception through the measurement date.\nGross Earning Assets is forecasted as of a specific date. It is forward-looking, and we use judgment in developing the assumptions used to calculate it. Factors that could impact Gross Earning Assets include, but are not limited to, customer payment defaults, or declines in utility rates or early termination of a contract in certain circumstances, including prior to installation.\nThe definitions of Gross Earning Assets, Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period, and Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period use a discount rate of 5%; whereas the definitions used previously in our periodic reports prior to December 31, 2020 used a discount rate of 6%.\n\n\nThe tables below provide a range of Gross Earning Asset amounts if different default, discount and purchase and renewal assumptions were used.\nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period:\n\nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period:\n\nTotal Gross Earning Assets:\n ", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe provide clean, solar energy to customers at a significant savings compared to traditional utility energy. We have been selling solar energy to residential customers through a variety of offerings since we were founded in 2007. We, either directly or through one of our solar partners, install a solar energy system on a customer's home and either sell the system to the customer or, as is more often the case, sell the energy generated by the system to the customer pursuant to a lease or power purchase agreement ( PPA\u201d) with no or low upfront costs. We refer to these leases and PPAs as Customer Agreements.\u201d Following installation, a system is interconnected to the local utility grid. The home's energy usage is provided by the solar energy system, with any additional energy needs provided by the local utility. Any excess solar energy, including amounts in excess of battery storage, that is not immediately used by the customers is exported to the utility grid using a bi-directional utility net meter, and the customer generally receives a credit for the excess energy from their utility to offset future usage of utility-generated energy.\nOn October 8, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Vivint Solar, Inc. (\"Vivint Solar\") a leading full-service residential solar provider in the United States, at an estimated purchase price of $5.0 billion, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 6, 2020, by and among Sunrun, Vivint Solar and Viking Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub\u201d). Further information about the acquisition of Vivint Solar can be found in Note 3, Acquisitions, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe offer our solar service offerings both directly to the customer and through our solar partners, which include sales and installation partners, and strategic partners, which include retail partners. In addition, we sell solar energy systems directly to customers for cash. We also sell solar energy panels and other products (such as racking) to resellers. As of December 31, 2021, we provided our solar services to customers and sold solar energy panels and other products to resellers throughout the United States. More than 40% of our cumulative systems deployed are in California.\nWe compete mainly with traditional utilities. In the markets we serve, our strategy is to price the energy we sell below prevailing local retail electricity rates. As a result, the price our customers pay under our solar service offerings varies depending on the state where the customer lives, the local traditional utility that otherwise provides electricity to the customer, as well as the prices other solar energy companies charge in that region. Even within the same neighborhood, site-specific characteristics drive meaningful variability in the revenue and cost profiles of each home. Using our proprietary technology, we target homes with advantageous revenue and cost characteristics, which means we are often able to offer pricing that allows customers to save more on their energy bill while maintaining our ability to meet our targeted returns. For example, with the insights provided by our technology, we can offer competitive pricing to customers with homes that have favorable characteristics, such as roofs that allow for easy installation, high electricity consumption, or low shading, effectively passing through the cost savings we are able to achieve on these installations to the customer.\nOur ability to offer Customer Agreements depends in part on our ability to finance the purchase and installation of the solar energy systems by monetizing the resulting customer cash flows and related commercial investment tax credits ( Commercial ITCs\u201d), accelerated tax depreciation and other incentives from governments and local utilities. We monetize these incentives under tax equity investment funds, which are generally structured as non-recourse project financings.

We contribute solar energy systems to an owner\u201d entity in exchange for interests in the owner entity, and the fund investors contribute cash to a tenant\u201d entity in exchange for interests in the tenant entity.\nUnder our pass-through financing obligation structure, in accordance with the provisions of FASB, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810 ( ASC 810\u201d) Consolidation, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the owner entity, and accordingly, we consolidate that entity. We have also determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the tenant entity, and accordingly, we do not consolidate that entity.\nIn this investment fund structure, the investors make a series of large up-front payments as well as, in some instances, subsequent smaller quarterly lease payments through their respective tenant entity to the corresponding owner entity in exchange for the assignment of cash flows from Customer Agreements and certain other benefits associated with the Customer Agreements and related solar energy systems. We account for the payments from investors as borrowings by recording the proceeds received as financing obligations. The financing obligation is reduced over a period of approximately 22 years, or over 7 years in the case of one fund, by customer payments under the Customer Agreements, U.S. Treasury grants (where applicable); and proceeds from the contracted resale of SRECs as they are received by the investor. In addition, funds paid for the Commercial ITC value upfront are initially recorded as a refund liability and recognized as revenue as the associated solar system reaches permission to operate (\"PTO\").\nWe account for these investment funds in our consolidated financial statements as if we have not assigned the Customer Agreement to the investor, and we record on our consolidated financial statements activities arising from the Customer Agreements and any related U.S. Treasury grants, Commercial ITCs monetized as part of the upfront payments received from the investor and SREC sales. The interest charge on our pass-through financing obligations is imputed at the inception of the fund based on the effective interest rate in the arrangement giving rise to the obligation and is updated prospectively as appropriate.\nIn certain arrangements, we agree to defer a portion of the up-front payments by arranging a loan between one of our indirectly wholly owned subsidiaries to a subsidiary of the investor's tenant entity.\nConsolidated Joint Ventures\nPartnership Flips. Under partnership flip structures, we and our fund investors contribute cash into a partnership entity. The partnership uses the cash to acquire solar energy systems developed by us with signed Customer Agreements. Each fund investor receives a rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis, which varies by investment fund. Prior to the fund investor receiving its contractual rate of return or for a time period specified in the contractual arrangements, the fund investor receives a significant portion of the value attributable to customer payments, a majority of the accelerated tax depreciation and substantially all of the Commercial ITCs. After the fund investor receives its contractual rate of return or after the specified time period, we receive substantially all of the value attributable to the remaining customer payments and SREC sales.\nIncluded within the Partnership Flips is the project equity financing we entered into in December 2016. We pooled and transferred our interests in certain financing funds into a special purpose entity ( SPE\u201d) with a new investor. We did not recognize a gain or loss on the transfer of its interests in the financing funds and continue to consolidate the financing funds. The SPE's assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the investor has no recourse to our other assets.\nUnder our partnership flip structures, we have determined that we control the partnership entity which is a variable interest entity ( VIE\u201d), and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record the investor's interest as either noncontrolling interests or redeemable noncontrolling interests in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInverted Leases. Under our inverted lease structure, we and the fund investor set up a multi-tiered investment vehicle that is comprised of two partnership entities which facilitate the pass through of the tax benefits to the fund investors. In this structure we contribute solar energy systems to an owner\u201d partnership entity in exchange for interests in the owner partnership and the fund investors contribute cash to a tenant\u201d partnership in exchange for interests in the tenant partnership, which in turn makes an investment in the owner partnership entity in exchange for interests in the owner partnership. The owner partnership uses the cash contributions received from the tenant partnership to purchase systems from us and/or fund installation of such systems. Under our existing JV inverted lease structure, a substantial portion of the value generated by the solar energy systems is provided to the fund investor for a specified period of time, which is generally based upon the period of time corresponding to the expiry of the recapture period associated with the Commercial ITCs. After that point in time, we receive substantially all of the value attributable to the long-term recurring customer payments and the other incentives. Generally, under the terms of each agreement, the investors' contributions include the value of Commercial ITCs earned or grants to be received by the fund investor. Any other proceeds are allocated on a pro rata basis to the fund investor and us in accordance with their ownership percentages. Since Sunrun has the power to control both the owner and tenant entities, both entities are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nWe also have one JV inverted lease fund whereby we have a pro rata interest in the entity and we account for the noncontrolling interest's share of income on a pro rata basis. Accordingly, the noncontrolling interest of this fund is carried on our balance sheet at the cumulative amount of capital contributions, reduced by cumulative distributions paid to the investor, as well as the pro rata share of their income. Under our JV inverted lease structure, we have determined that we control each VIE, and accordingly we consolidate the entity and record investor's interest as a noncontrolling interest or redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nFor all of our partnership flips and JV inverted leases, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is carried on our balance sheet at the greater of the redemption value or the amount calculated under the HLBV method. The HLBV method estimates the amount that, if the fund's assets were hypothetically sold at their book value, the investor would be entitled to receive according to the liquidation waterfall in the partnership agreement.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operating metrics, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. Some of our key operating metrics are estimates that are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each of these estimates, we caution you that these estimates are based on a combination of assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate over time. Any inaccuracies could be material to our actual results when compared to our calculations. Please see the section titled Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Furthermore, other companies may calculate these metrics differently than we do now or in the future, which would reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\u2022Networked Solar Energy Capacity represents the aggregate megawatt production capacity of our solar energy systems, whether sold directly to customers or subject to executed Customer Agreements (i) for which we have confirmation that the systems are installed on the roof, subject to final inspection; (ii) in the case of certain system installations by our partners, for which we have accrued at least 80% of the expected project cost (inclusive of acquisitions of installed systems), or (iii) for multi-family and any other systems that have reached NTP, measured on the percentage of the project that has been completed based on expected project cost. Systems that have met these criteria are considered to be deployed.\n\u2022Gross Earning Assets is calculated as Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period plus Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period.\n\u25e6Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period represents the present value of the remaining net cash flows (discounted at 5%) during the initial term of our Customer Agreements as of the measurement date. It is calculated as the present value of cash flows (discounted at 5%) we expect to receive from Subscribers in future periods, after deducting expected operating and maintenance costs, equipment replacements costs, distributions to tax equity partners in consolidated joint venture partnership flip structures, and distributions to project equity investors. We include cash flows we expect to receive in future periods from state incentive and rebate programs, contracted sales of solar renewable energy credits, and awarded net cash flows from grid service programs with utility or grid operators.\n\u25e6Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period is the forecasted net present value we would receive upon or following the expiration of the initial Customer Agreement term but before the 30th anniversary of the system's activation (either in the form of cash payments during any applicable renewal period or a system purchase at the end of the initial term), for Subscribers as of the measurement date. We calculate the Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period amount at the expiration of the initial contract term assuming either a system purchase or a renewal, forecasting only a 30-year customer relationship (although the customer may renew for additional years, or purchase the system), at a contract rate equal to 90% of the customer's contractual rate in effect at the end of the initial contract term. After the initial contract term, our Customer Agreements typically automatically renew on an annual basis and the rate is initially set at up to a 10% discount to then-prevailing utility power prices.\n\u25e6Subscribers represent the cumulative number of Customer Agreements for systems that have been recognized as deployments through the measurement date.\n\u2022Customers represent the cumulative number of deployments, from our inception through the measurement date.\nGross Earning Assets is forecasted as of a specific date. It is forward-looking, and we use judgment in developing the assumptions used to calculate it. Factors that could impact Gross Earning Assets include, but are not limited to, customer payment defaults, or declines in utility rates or early termination of a contract in certain circumstances, including prior to installation.\nThe definitions of Gross Earning Assets, Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period, and Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period use a discount rate of 5%; whereas the definitions used previously in our periodic reports prior to December 31, 2020 used a discount rate of 6%.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Networked Solar Energy Capacity (megawatts) </td> <td> </td> <td>4,677 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,885 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers </td> <td> </td> <td>660,311 </td> <td> </td> <td>550,078 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Earning Assets Contracted Period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,638,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,234,164 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Earning Assets Renewal Period </td> <td> </td> <td>3,033,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,539,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Earning Assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,671,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,773,475 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe tables below provide a range of Gross Earning Asset amounts if different default, discount and purchase and renewal assumptions were used.\nGross Earning Assets Contracted Period:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Default rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,691,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,029,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,452,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,947,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,503,868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,925,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,237,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,638,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,114,671 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,654,168 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross Earning Assets Renewal Period:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rate </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase or Renewal rate </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>80% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,933,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,211,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,632,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,165,800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,788,291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>90% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,530,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,700,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,033,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,495,631 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,060,842 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,127,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,188,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,433,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,825,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,333,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Gross Earning Assets:\n "}
