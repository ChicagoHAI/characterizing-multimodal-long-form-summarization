Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part I, Item 1: Business,\u201d Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing, including Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those described in any such forward-looking statement.\nBusiness Overview and Environment\nTESSCO Technologies Incorporated (TESSCO, we, or the Company) architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless systems. Although we sell products to customers in almost 100 countries, approximately 98% of our sales are to customers in the United States. We have operations and office facilities in Timonium and Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we modified the structure of our internal organization, in an effort to better serve the market place. Retail inventory typically has a shorter more defined life cycle and is, typically, ultimately used by individual end users. Commercial inventory typically has a life cycle that tends to be tied to changes in regulation or technology and includes products typically used by business entities or governments. Reflective of these differences, our sales and product teams were reorganized and each now reports to either a retail or commercial leader. We concluded that corresponding changes to our reportable segments are warranted and now evaluate our business within two segments: commercial and retail. The commercial segment consists of the following customer markets: (1) public carriers that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; (2) government, including federal agencies and state and local governments that run wireless networks for their own use as well as value-added resellers who specialize in selling to the government; (3) private system operators, including commercial entities such as enterprise customers, major utilities and transportation companies; and (4) value-added resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and two-way radio communications equipment primarily for the enterprise market. The retail segment consists of the market which includes retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers. All prior financial periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect this change.\nWe offer a wide range of products that are classified into four business categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; installation, test and maintenance; and mobile devices and accessories. Base infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless telecommunications. Sales of traditional base station infrastructure products, such as base station radios, cable and transmission lines and antennas are in part dependent on capital spending in the wireless communications industry. Network systems products are used to build and upgrade computing and internet networks. We have also been growing our offering of wireless broadband, network equipment, security and surveillance products, which are not as dependent on the overall capital spending of the industry. Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment. This category is made up of sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency-, voltage- and power-measuring devices, replacement parts and components as well as an assortment of tools, hardware and supplies required by service technicians. Mobile devices and\naccessory products include cellular phone and data device accessories. Our customers generally have the ability to purchase from any of our product categories.\nThe wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of several national distributors. In addition, many manufacturers sell direct. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessory market, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base. In addition, the agreements or arrangements with our customers or vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions are typically of limited duration and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, our large customer base and our purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize the results of our

to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenues. Revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased by 8.8% as compared to fiscal year 2017. In the commercial segment, revenue increased by 16.3% with growth in all markets. The public carrier market revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased by 40.3%, as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to increased spending among our tower owner and program manager customers, and also due in part to better execution of our selling strategy in this market. We increased sales with our current customers and cultivated new significant customer relationships. This revenue growth was echoed in our private systems operators market and value-added resellers market with growth of 13.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Revenue from our government market increased by 10.4% due primarily to growth from our federal government customers. The revenue growth within our commercial segment was partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in our retail segment revenue for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was due in part to consolidation of our customer base within the retail market and due to a shift in customer behavior where customers are keeping the same phone for longer periods of time, resulting in lower accessories purchases.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased by 7.6% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. In the commercial segment, gross profit increased by 7.7%. This increase was primarily driven by increases in our public carriers and private systems operators markets of 21.9% and 12.7%, respectively. We experienced margin compression within our public carrier market primarily due to a change in customer mix, with increased sales going to larger customers which required better pricing. Gross profit within our government market increased by 8.7% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. The growth in the public carriers, private systems and government markets was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of 0.6% within our value-added resellers market. Within the retail segment, gross profit increased by 7.4% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017, despite a decline in revenue. This increase in gross margin was a result of product mix and increased support from our vendors. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly to 20.7% in fiscal year 2018, compared to 21.0% in fiscal year 2017, primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.\nOur ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions is dependent upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer's or vendor's business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or global financial crisis.\nWe account for inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and as a result write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. These expenses have been less than 1% of overall purchases for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses increased 2.8% during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 20.5% in fiscal year 2017 to 19.4% in fiscal year 2018. The following are descriptions of changes in significant components of selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses:\nTable 39: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPerformance bonus expense (including both cash and equity plans) increased by $3.0 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017.

As the transition was completed during fiscal 2017, corporate support expense decreased by $0.9 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. Accordingly, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $797,100 and $674,200 for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, respectively.\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense increased, from $58,600 in fiscal year 2017 to $429,100 in fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily related higher borrowing levels on our secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 through 8 to the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowings.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share. The effective tax rates in fiscal year 2018 and 2017 were 30.5% and 41.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act that went into effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as a change in treatment of a deferred tax liability relating to our accounting for a key man life insurance policy, discussed below. The 2017 Tax Act requires fiscal year companies to blend their federal tax rates this year. Our annual federal rate for fiscal 2018 will be based on 9 months at the old rate of approximately 35% rate and 3 months at the new 21% rate. We were also able to take a benefit on our net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, which now reflect the lower federal rate. See Note 13 Income Taxes to the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effect of the 2017 Tax Act and the change in treatment of the deferred tax liability. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018 increased 259.5% and 258.8%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2017.\nAfter we announced our fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results by press release dated May 7, 2018, we determined it necessary to change how we account for the cash surrender value of certain key-man life insurance policies held by us. We had for many years recorded a deferred tax liability related to the incremental increase year over year in the cash surrender value of the policies. After further analysis, it was determined that the annual change in cash surrender value, which has accumulated slowly over many years, should have been treated as an offset to the non-deductible insurance premiums related to the same policies, and not as a deferred tax liability. As such, we adjusted our fiscal 2018 financial results to reflect the favorable change in tax treatment as applied to the aggregate amount of the incremental increases that have accumulated over the multi-year period. Specifically, net deferred tax assets increased by an aggregate of $0.5 million and income tax expense correspondingly decreased by an aggregate of $0.5 million. Correspondingly, net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by $0.5 million and $0.06 per share, respectively, due to a one-time adjustment resulting from this change in tax treatment. There was no impact on net cash flow used in operations. This change has no impact on previously filed tax returns.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenues. Revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased slightly by 0.5% as compared to fiscal year 2016. Revenue from our government market increased by 11.1% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. We have continued to invest in this market, which has led to an increase in government contracts, especially with our state and local government customers. Revenues within our private system operators market increased by 7.4% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to an increase in sales to our utility customers. Revenue from the public carrier and value-added resellers markets, decreased by 8.0% and 1.4%, respectively, due to a dramatic slowdown in the purchases by our cellular carrier customers and the general contractors and integrators doing work on their behalf, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. During the second half of fiscal 2017, we saw improved year-over-year quarterly sales in the carrier markets as purchases increased from key contractors and integrators. Revenue in the second half of fiscal 2017 increased 23.0% in the public carrier market as compared to the same period of fiscal 2016 as a result of these increased purchases.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was essentially flat with a 0.2% decrease in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a 9.6% decrease in our public carriers market for fiscal year 2017 as compared\nto fiscal year 2016. This decrease was almost fully offset by increases in gross profit of our government market and our value-added resellers market of 6.8% and 2.0%, respectively. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly to 21.0% in fiscal year 2017, compared to 21.1% in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.\nOur ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions is dependent upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer's or vendor's business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or global financial crisis.\nWe account for inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and as a result write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. These expenses have been less than 1% of overall purchases for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses increased 6.1% during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly from 19.4% in fiscal year 2016 to 20.5% in fiscal year 2017. The following are descriptions of changes in significant components of selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarketing expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to direct marketing costs associated with improved design and content of our TESSCO.com website and increased market development funds associated with sales to our retail customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCompensation and benefits expense increased by $4.2 million, or 6.8%, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily related to higher business generation across all markets and operations compensation costs to support the increase in retail sales volume. Additionally, we incurred $0.8 million in onetime severance costs in relation to a restructuring of our sales and product teams.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPerformance bonus expense (including both cash and equity plans) increased by $1.1 million in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase is primarily related to bonuses paid to our former and current CEO related to the transition that occurred during this fiscal year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 46: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we received the results of a software license audit conducted by a major software provider. After significant negotiations, we settled the audit for $1.5 million, which was accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The ongoing annual cost from the results of this audit is minimal.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. Accordingly, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $674,200 and $637,100 for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively.\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense decreased, from $161,300 in fiscal year 2016 to $58,600 in fiscal year 2017. The decrease is primarily related to the extinguishment of our term loan and lower borrowing levels on our secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowings.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share. The effective tax rates in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 were 41.9% and 39.8%, respectively. The increased rate is primarily a result of lower pre-tax income which increases the impact of non-deductible tax differences. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2017 decreased 72.9% and 73.8%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flow (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(9,247,100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,051,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,141,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flow used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,539,400)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,563,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,513,800)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flow provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,265,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,831,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,268,500)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,520,700)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,342,700)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,358,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe used $9.2 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2018. This outflow was driven by increases in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), and an increase in accounts payable. Increasing sales to our public carrier customers required significant investments in inventory and at times has resulted in larger accounts receivable balances. Accounts payable also increased in response to our higher inventory levels. Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business have required an increase in working capital investments. As such, on October 19, 2017 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed below, based upon our anticipated borrowing and cash needs.\nWe generated $3.1 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2017. This inflow was driven by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and product inventory. Accounts receivable increased due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Inventory and accounts payable increased as a result of strategic purchases combined with a general increase in base station infrastructure inventory for our public system operators, contractors, and program managers market. Additionally, our inventory levels for certain Ventev\u00ae product lines have also increased. The reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as the decrease in accrued expense and other liabilities are both primarily related to a tower owner customer whose inventory we have held on its behalf since fiscal year 2015. Because we held the inventory on the tower owner's behalf, the cost of these goods was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and we were unable to recognize the revenue and related cost of goods sold associated with the transaction until the product physically shipped. During fiscal year 2017, most of the remaining inventory was shipped and therefore the corresponding portion of the deferred revenue and cost of goods sold were partially recognized.\nWe generated $20.1 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016. This inflow was driven by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), a decrease in accounts receivable and product inventory, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expense and other current liabilities. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily related to better collections in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to an effort to reduce overall inventory levels while maintaining high service levels. The reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as the decrease in accrued expense and other liabilities are both primarily related to the tower owner customer referred to above. During fiscal year 2016, the majority of this inventory was shipped and therefore the corresponding portion of deferred revenue and cost of goods sold were partially recognized.\nCapital expenditures of $3.5 million in fiscal year 2018 were up from $2.6 million in fiscal year 2017 and flat with $3.5 million in fiscal year 2016. Fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures were largely comprised of investments in information technology of $2.8 million, $2.4 million, and $3.1 million, respectively.\nCash flows generated from financing in fiscal year 2018 were primarily related to borrowings from our line of\ncredit partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 were primarily related to cash dividends paid to shareholders and the repayment of our term loan which was secured by a first position deed of trust encumbering Company-owned real property in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 were primarily related to cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nOn April 23, 2014, our Board of Directors expanded our then existing stock buyback program and authorized the purchase on a non-accelerated basis of up to $10.0 million of the Company's stock over a 24-month period, ending in April 2016. Our Board of Directors believes that the repurchase of our shares, when appropriate, is an excellent use of funds to enhance long-term shareholder value. Purchases were funded from working capital and/or our revolving credit facility. Shares could be purchased from time to time in the open market, by block purchase, or through negotiated transactions, or other transactions managed by broker-dealers. No shares were repurchased during fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. The stock buyback program expired in April 2016.\nWe also withhold shares from our employees and directors, at their request, equal to the minimum federal and state tax withholdings related to vested equity grants. For fiscal years 2018 and 2017 this totaled $65,400 and $192,400, respectively. Our revolving credit facility with SunTrust Bank limits to $2.0 million the aggregate dollar value of shares that may be withheld or repurchased in connection with satisfaction of these tax withholding obligations during any 12 month period. At April 1, 2018 we had the ability to withhold or repurchase $1.9 million in additional shares of our common stock during fiscal 2018, without violating this covenant.\nOn June 24, 2016, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent and Lender, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a Lender, for a senior asset based secured revolving credit facility of up to $35 million (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). This replaced our previously existing $35 million unsecured revolving credit facility with both SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, which had no outstanding principal balance at the time of replacement. The replacement Revolving Credit Facility included terms providing for its maturity after five years, on June 24, 2021, and for a $5.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swing line loans. Borrowing Availability under the replacement Revolving Credit Facility as it was initially established is determined in part in accordance with a Borrowing Base, defined in the Credit Agreement, generally, as 85% of Eligible Receivables minus Reserves.\nThe Credit Agreement also set forth financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio to be maintained at any time during which the borrowing availability, as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement, falls below $10 million, as well as terms that could limit our ability to engage in specified transactions or activities, including (but not limited to) investments and acquisitions, sales of assets, payment of dividends, issuance of additional debt and other matters.\nPursuant to a related Guaranty and Security Agreement by and among the Company, the other Company affiliate borrowers under the Credit Agreement and other subsidiaries of the Company, referred to collectively as the Loan Parties, and SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, the Loan Parties' obligations, which include the obligations under the Credit Agreement, were guaranteed by those Loan Parties not otherwise borrowers, and secured by continuing first priority security interests in the Company's and the other Loan Parties' (including both borrowers and guarantors) inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and in all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights and chattel paper, in each case to the extent relating to inventory and accounts, and all proceeds of the foregoing. The security interests were granted in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders party to the Credit Agreement from time to time. The obligations secured also include certain other obligations of the Loan Parties to the Lenders and their affiliates arising from time to time, relating to swaps, hedges and cash management and other bank products.\nEffective July 13, 2017, we entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement, pursuant to which, the term Availability\u201d as used in the Credit Agreement was amended for a period of time ending no later than October 31, 2017, to allow for the inclusion of an additional sum when calculating Availability\u201d for certain limited purposes. This additional sum equals the lesser of $10 million, and the amount by which the Borrowing Base exceeds $35 million. This First Amendment did not provide for any increase in the $35 million Aggregate Revolving Commitment Amount, but allowed the Company greater flexibility under the Credit Agreement for a limited period of time, until October 31, 2017, and was\nsought by the Company in response to business opportunities identified by the Company. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this and the preceding three paragraphs have the meanings ascribed to each in the Credit Agreement or First Amendment, as applicable.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company and its primary operating subsidiaries, as co-borrowers, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent and Lender, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as a Lender (the \"Amended and Restated Credit Agreement\"). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Credit Agreement for the secured Revolving Credit Facility, as previously established in June 2016, was amended and restated in order to, among other things, increase the Company's borrowing limit from up to $35 million to up to $75 million. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this and the following three paragraphs have the meanings ascribed to each in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nIn addition to expanding the borrowing limit, the Amended and Restated Credit Facility extends the applicable maturity date to October 19, 2021. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement otherwise includes representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants (including restrictions) and other terms generally consistent with those applicable to the facility as existing prior to the execution and delivery of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, but with certain modifications. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $5.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, a $12.5 million sublimit for swingline loans and an accordion feature which, subject to certain conditions, could increase the aggregate amount of the commitments to up to $125 million, with the optional commitments being provided by existing Lenders or new lenders reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. No Lender is obligated to increase its commitment. Availability is determined in accordance with a Borrowing Base, which has been expanded to include not only Eligible Receivables but also Eligible Inventory and is generally: (A) the sum of (i) 85% of Eligible Receivables; (ii) the Inventory Formula Amount for all Eligible Inventory which is aged less than 181 days; and (iii) the lesser of (x) $4 million and (y) the Inventory Formula Amount for all Eligible Inventory which is aged at least 181 days; minus (B) Reserves. Upon closing, there was $23.4 million outstanding under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.\nLike the secured Revolving Credit Facility as existing prior to the execution and delivery of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, borrowings under the secured Revolving Credit Facility as now evidenced by the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement initially accrue interest from the applicable borrowing date at an Applicable Rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The Eurodollar Rate is the rate per annum obtained by dividing (i) LIBOR by (ii) a percentage equal to 1.00 minus the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage. When the Applicable Rate is the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Applicable Margin is 1.50% if Average Availability is greater than or equal to $15 million, and 1.75% otherwise. Under certain circumstances, the Applicable Rate is subject to change at the Lenders' option from the Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin. In any event, following an Event of Default, in addition to changing the Applicable Rate to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, the Lenders' may at their option set the Applicable Margin at 0.50% if the Base Rate applies or 1.75% if the Eurodollar Rate applies, and increase the Applicable Rate by an additional 200 basis points. The Applicable Rate adjusts on the first Business Day of each calendar month. The Company is required to pay a monthly Commitment Fee on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility provided for pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, at a per annum rate equal to 0.25%. As of April 1, 2018, we had a $10.8 million balance on the Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, we had $64.2 million available, subject to the Borrowing Base limitations and compliance with the other applicable terms of the Credit Agreement, including the covenants referenced above.\nIn connection with the entering into of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company and the other Loan Parties executed and delivered to SunTrust Bank, as Administrative Agent, a Reaffirmation Agreement, pursuant to which the obligations of the Loan Parties under the Guaranty and Security Agreement delivered by the Loan Parties in connection with the secured credit facility as previously existing (including the previously existing guaranty by the Loan Parties not otherwise Borrowers and the previously existing grant by the Company and the other Loan Parties of a continuing first priority security interest in inventory, accounts receivable and deposit accounts, and on all documents, instruments, general intangibles, letter of credit rights, and all proceeds) were ratified and confirmed as respects the Obligations arising under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility from time to time.\nAt the end of fiscal year 2018, we were in compliance with the financial covenants applicable under our revolving\ncredit facility with SunTrust Bank.\nOn March 31, 2009, we entered into a term loan with the Baltimore County Economic Development Revolving Loan Fund for an aggregate principal amount of $250,000. The term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of $2,300, with the balance due at maturity on April 1, 2019. The term loan bears interest at 2.00% per annum and is secured by a subordinate position on our Hunt Valley, Maryland facility. At April 1, 2018, the principal balance of this term loan was approximately $29,600.\nWorking capital (current assets less current liabilities) decreased to $74.8 million as of April 1, 2018, from $77.2 million as of March 26, 2017. Shareholders' equity was flat at $108.1 million as of April 1, 2018, and $108.0 million as of March 26, 2017.\nWe believe that our existing cash, payments from customers, and availability under our revolving credit facility (including any amendment or replacement thereof), or if needed, financing we believe would be available to us from other sources, will be sufficient to support our operations for at least the next twelve months. We expect to meet short-term liquidity needs through cash on our balance sheet and operating cash flow, supplemented by our revolving credit facility; and we expect to meet long-term liquidity needs through these same resources. If we were to undertake an acquisition or other major capital purchases that require funds in excess of our existing sources of liquidity, we would look to sources of funding from additional credit facilities, debt and/or equity issuances. There can be no assurances that such additional future sources of funding, either to fund an acquisition or major capital purchase, or to support our cash flow needs in the event of the termination of our existing revolving credit facility before it can be replaced with an asset based facility, would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIn addition, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by decreasing revenues and profits resulting from a decrease in demand for our products or a reduction in capital expenditures by our customers, or by the weakened financial conditions of our customers or suppliers, in each case as a result of a possible downturn in the global economy, among other factors.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of April 1, 2018:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayment Due by Fiscal Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMore Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears 1-3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears 4-5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLong-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n29,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n27,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevolving credit facility (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,503,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,022,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n105,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLease Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,330,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,003,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n5,108,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n218,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Long-Term Liabilities (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,087,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n75,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n712,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTax contingency reserves (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n337,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal contractual cash obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n21,288,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,128,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5,635,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n473,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n712,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nWe are subject to a 0.25% fee on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility.

See further discussion in Note 13-\"Income Taxes\" to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations:\nRevenue Recognition. We record revenues when 1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, 3) our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and 4) collectability is reasonably assured. Our revenue recognition policy includes evidence of arrangements for significant revenue transactions through either receipt of a customer purchase order or a web-based order. We record revenues when risk of loss has passed to the customer. In most cases, shipments are made using FOB shipping terms. For a portion of our sales, we use FOB destination terms and record the revenue when the product is received by the customer. Our prices are always fixed at the time of sale. Historically, there have not been any material concessions provided to or by customers, future discounts, or other incentives subsequent to a sale. We sell under normal commercial terms and, therefore, we only record revenues on transactions where collectability is reasonably assured.\nBecause a large portion of our sales transactions meet the conditions set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) on revenue recognition, we recognize revenues from sales transactions containing sales returns provisions at the time of the sale. These conditions require that 1) our price be substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale, 2) the buyer is obligated to pay us, and such obligation is not contingent on their resale of the product, 3) the buyer's obligation to us does not change in the event of theft or physical\ndestruction or damage of the product, 4) the buyer has economic substance apart from us, 5) we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer, and 6) the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated. Because our normal terms and conditions of sale are consistent with conditions 1-5 above, and we are able to perform condition 6, we make a reasonable estimate of product returns in sales transactions and accrue a sales return reserve based on this estimate.\nOur current and potential customers are continuing to look for ways to reduce their inventories and lower their total costs, including distribution, order taking and fulfillment costs, while still providing their customers excellent service. Some of these companies have turned to us to implement supply chain solutions, including purchasing inventory, assisting in demand forecasting, configuring, packaging, kitting and delivering products and managing customer and vendor relations, from order taking through cash collections. In performing these solutions, we assume varying levels of involvement in the transactions and varying levels of credit and inventory risk. As our offerings continually evolve to meet the needs of our customers, we constantly evaluate our revenue accounting based on the guidance set forth in accounting standards generally accepted in the United States. When applying this guidance in accordance with the FASB standard regarding revenue recognition for principal-agent considerations, we look at the following indicators: whether we are the primary obligor in the transaction; whether we have general inventory risk; whether we have latitude in establishing price; the extent to which we change the product or perform part of the service; whether we have responsibility for supplier selection; whether we are involved in the determination of product and service specifications; whether we have physical inventory risk; whether we have credit risk; and whether the amount we earn is fixed. Each of our customer relationships is independently evaluated based on the above guidance and revenues are recorded on the appropriate basis. Based on a review of the factors above, in the majority of our sales relationships, we have concluded that we are the principal in the transaction and we record revenues based upon the gross amounts earned and booked. However, we do have certain relationships where we are not the principal and we record revenues on a net fee basis, regardless of amounts billed (less than 1% of our total revenues for fiscal year 2018).\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. We use estimates to determine the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts necessary to reduce accounts receivable and unbilled receivables to their expected net realizable value. We estimate the amount of the required allowance by reviewing the status of past-due receivables and analyzing historical bad debt trends. Actual collection experience has not varied significantly from estimates, due primarily to credit policies, collection experience and our stability as it relates to our current customer base. Typical payments from commercial customers are due 30 days from the date of the invoice. We charge-off receivables deemed to be uncollectible to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances are not collateralized.\nInventory Reserves. We establish inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. We regularly review inventory to evaluate continued demand and identify any obsolete or excess quantities of inventory. We record a provision for the difference between excess and obsolete inventory and its estimated realizable value. Estimated realizable value is based on anticipated future product demand, market conditions and liquidation values. Actual results differing from these projections could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nImpairment of Long-Lived and Indefinite-Lived Assets. Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 1, 2018, includes goodwill of approximately $11.7 million and other indefinite lived intangible assets of $0.8 million. We perform annual impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived assets on the first day of our fourth quarter. We also periodically evaluate our long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators. The goodwill and intangible assets impairment test involves an initial qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that an intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If qualitative factors suggest a possible impairment the company then performs an additional two-step approach. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows, market conditions, operational performance and legal factors. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our goodwill reporting units include (a) a cash flow period; (b) a terminal value based on a growth rate; and (c) a discount rate, which is based on our weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with our operations. Based on the Company's qualitative assessment for fiscal year 2018, we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units with goodwill or intangible assets is above the fair value of the related reporting unit. Due to the change in segment reporting, we performed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill on the annual impairment testing date in fiscal year 2018. Based on this quantitative testing we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that the carrying value of our reporting units with goodwill is above the fair value of the\nrelated reporting unit. Future events, such as significant changes in cash flow assumptions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets are impaired. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization as a potential impairment indicator considering overall market conditions and specific industry events. Had the determination been made that the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were impaired, the value of these assets would have been reduced by an amount up to $12.5 million, resulting in a corresponding charge to operations.\nThe methods of assessing fair value for reporting units with goodwill as well as for indefinite lived assets require significant judgments to be made by management, including future revenues, expenses, cash flows and discount rates. Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results.\nIncome Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability. This review is based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. Based on this review, we have not established a valuation allowance because our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not realizable, resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe account for income taxes under the FASB's ASC on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. This standard prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on de-recognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As of April 1, 2018, we had total net unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $377,700, all of which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation. We record stock-based compensation in accordance with the FASB standard regarding stock compensation and share-based payments. We account for forfeitures as they occur rather than estimate expected forfeitures. The standard also requires stock awards granted or modified after the adoption of the standard that include both performance conditions and graded vesting to be amortized by an accelerated method rather than the straight-line method.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements is contained in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Report may contain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of the words may,\u201d will,\u201d expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d and similar expressions, but the absence of these words or phrases does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward looking. Forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those described in or contemplated by any such forward-looking statement for a variety of reasons, including those risks identified in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, under the heading Risk Factors\u201d and otherwise. Consequently, the reader is cautioned to consider all forward-looking statements in light of the risks to which they are subject.\nWe are not able to identify or control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and operating results. Without limiting the risks that we describe in our periodic reports and elsewhere, among the risks that could lead to a materially adverse impact on our business or operating results are the following: termination or non-renewal of limited duration agreements or arrangements with our vendors and affinity partners which are typically terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise relatively short notice; loss of significant customers, vendors or relationships, including affinity relationships; loss of customers or a reduction in customer business either directly or indirectly as a result of consolidation among large wireless service carriers and others within the wireless communications industry; any deterioration in the strength of our customers', vendors' or affinity partners' businesses; increasingly negative or prolonged adverse economic conditions, including those adversely affecting consumer confidence or consumer or business spending, or otherwise adversely affecting our vendors or customers, including their access to capital or liquidity or our customers' demand for our ability to fund or pay for the purchase of our products and services; our dependence on a relatively small number of suppliers and vendors, which could hamper our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and meet customer demand; failure of our information technology systems or distribution systems, exposure to cyber-attacks, and the cost associated with ongoing efforts to maintain cyber security measures and to meet applicable compliance standards; damage or destruction of our distribution or other facilities; prolonged or otherwise unusual quality or performance control problems; technology changes in the wireless communications industry, or technological failures, which could lead to significant inventory obsolescence or devaluation and/or our inability to offer key products that our customers demand; third-party freight carrier interruption; increased competition from competitors, including manufacturers or national and regional distributors of the products we sell and the absence of significant barriers to entry which could result in pricing and other pressures on profitability and market share; our relative bargaining power and inability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors and customers; our inability to access capital and obtain or retain financing as and when needed; transitional and other risks associated with acquisitions of companies that we may undertake in an effort to expand our business; the possibility that, for unforeseen reasons, we may be delayed in entering into or performing, or may fail to enter into or perform, anticipated contracts or may otherwise be delayed in realizing or fail to realize anticipated revenues or anticipated savings; our inability to protect certain intellectual property, including systems and technologies on which we rely; claims against us for breach of the intellectual property rights of third parties; product liability claims; changes in political and regulatory conditions, including tax and trade policies; and our inability to hire or retain for any reason our key professionals, management and staff.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet web site address is: www.tessco.com.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part I, Item 1: Business,\u201d Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing, including Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those described in any such forward-looking statement.\nBusiness Overview and Environment\nTESSCO Technologies Incorporated (TESSCO, we, or the Company) architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless systems. Although we sell products to customers in almost 100 countries, approximately 98% of our sales are to customers in the United States. We have operations and office facilities in Timonium and Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we modified the structure of our internal organization, in an effort to better serve the market place. Retail inventory typically has a shorter more defined life cycle and is, typically, ultimately used by individual end users. Commercial inventory typically has a life cycle that tends to be tied to changes in regulation or technology and includes products typically used by business entities or governments. Reflective of these differences, our sales and product teams were reorganized and each now reports to either a retail or commercial leader. We concluded that corresponding changes to our reportable segments are warranted and now evaluate our business within two segments: commercial and retail. The commercial segment consists of the following customer markets: (1) public carriers that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; (2) government, including federal agencies and state and local governments that run wireless networks for their own use as well as value-added resellers who specialize in selling to the government; (3) private system operators, including commercial entities such as enterprise customers, major utilities and transportation companies; and (4) value-added resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and two-way radio communications equipment primarily for the enterprise market. The retail segment consists of the market which includes retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers. All prior financial periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect this change.\nWe offer a wide range of products that are classified into four business categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; installation, test and maintenance; and mobile devices and accessories. Base infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless telecommunications. Sales of traditional base station infrastructure products, such as base station radios, cable and transmission lines and antennas are in part dependent on capital spending in the wireless communications industry. Network systems products are used to build and upgrade computing and internet networks. We have also been growing our offering of wireless broadband, network equipment, security and surveillance products, which are not as dependent on the overall capital spending of the industry. Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment. This category is made up of sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency-, voltage- and power-measuring devices, replacement parts and components as well as an assortment of tools, hardware and supplies required by service technicians. Mobile devices and\naccessory products include cellular phone and data device accessories. Our customers generally have the ability to purchase from any of our product categories.\nThe wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of several national distributors. In addition, many manufacturers sell direct. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessory market, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base. In addition, the agreements or arrangements with our customers or vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions are typically of limited duration and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, our large customer base and our purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize the results of our operations for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016:\n\nFiscal Year 2018 Compared to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenues. Revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased by 8.8% as compared to fiscal year 2017. In the commercial segment, revenue increased by 16.3% with growth in all markets. The public carrier market revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased by 40.3%, as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to increased spending among our tower owner and program manager customers, and also due in part to better execution of our selling strategy in this market. We increased sales with our current customers and cultivated new significant customer relationships. This revenue growth was echoed in our private systems operators market and value-added resellers market with growth of 13.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Revenue from our government market increased by 10.4% due primarily to growth from our federal government customers. The revenue growth within our commercial segment was partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in our retail segment revenue for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was due in part to consolidation of our customer base within the retail market and due to a shift in customer behavior where customers are keeping the same phone for longer periods of time, resulting in lower accessories purchases.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased by 7.6% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. In the commercial segment, gross profit increased by 7.7%. This increase was primarily driven by increases in our public carriers and private systems operators markets of 21.9% and 12.7%, respectively. We experienced margin compression within our public carrier market primarily due to a change in customer mix, with increased sales going to larger customers which required better pricing. Gross profit within our government market increased by 8.7% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. The growth in the public carriers, private systems and government markets was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of 0.6% within our value-added resellers market. Within the retail segment, gross profit increased by 7.4% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017, despite a decline in revenue. This increase in gross margin was a result of product mix and increased support from our vendors. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly to 20.7% in fiscal year 2018, compared to 21.0% in fiscal year 2017, primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.\nOur ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions is dependent upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer's or vendor's business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or global financial crisis.\nWe account for inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and as a result write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. These expenses have been less than 1% of overall purchases for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses increased 2.8% during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 20.5% in fiscal year 2017 to 19.4% in fiscal year 2018. The following are descriptions of changes in significant components of selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses:\n \u00b7 Performance bonus expense (including both cash and equity plans) increased by $3.0 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. Our bonus programs are typically based on achieving annual performance targets. The relationship between expected performance and actual performance led to higher bonus accruals in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. \n \u00b7 Freight out expense increased by $0.7 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to our increased sales. \n \u00b7 Expenses related to information technology increased by $0.7 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to increased cost relating to Tessco.com improvements. \n \u00b7 During fiscal year 2017 we incurred corporate support expenses including both recruiting and professional service fees relating to the transition to our new CEO. As the transition was completed during fiscal 2017, corporate support expense decreased by $0.9 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. \nWe continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. Accordingly, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $797,100 and $674,200 for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, respectively.\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense increased, from $58,600 in fiscal year 2017 to $429,100 in fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily related higher borrowing levels on our secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 through 8 to the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowings.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share. The effective tax rates in fiscal year 2018 and 2017 were 30.5% and 41.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act that went into effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as a change in treatment of a deferred tax liability relating to our accounting for a key man life insurance policy, discussed below. The 2017 Tax Act requires fiscal year companies to blend their federal tax rates this year. Our annual federal rate for fiscal 2018 will be based on 9 months at the old rate of approximately 35% rate and 3 months at the new 21% rate. We were also able to take a benefit on our net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, which now reflect the lower federal rate. See Note 13 Income Taxes to the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effect of the 2017 Tax Act and the change in treatment of the deferred tax liability. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018 increased 259.5% and 258.8%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2017.\nAfter we announced our fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results by press release dated May 7, 2018, we determined it necessary to change how we account for the cash surrender value of certain key-man life insurance policies held by us. We had for many years recorded a deferred tax liability related to the incremental increase year over year in the cash surrender value of the policies. After further analysis, it was determined that the annual change in cash surrender value, which has accumulated slowly over many years, should have been treated as an offset to the non-deductible insurance premiums related to the same policies, and not as a deferred tax liability. As such, we adjusted our fiscal 2018 financial results to reflect the favorable change in tax treatment as applied to the aggregate amount of the incremental increases that have accumulated over the multi-year period. Specifically, net deferred tax assets increased by an aggregate of $0.5 million and income tax expense correspondingly decreased by an aggregate of $0.5 million. Correspondingly, net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by $0.5 million and $0.06 per share, respectively, due to a one-time adjustment resulting from this change in tax treatment. There was no impact on net cash flow used in operations. This change has no impact on previously filed tax returns.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenues. Revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased slightly by 0.5% as compared to fiscal year 2016. Revenue from our government market increased by 11.1% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. We have continued to invest in this market, which has led to an increase in government contracts, especially with our state and local government customers. Revenues within our private system operators market increased by 7.4% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to an increase in sales to our utility customers. Revenue from the public carrier and value-added resellers markets, decreased by 8.0% and 1.4%, respectively, due to a dramatic slowdown in the purchases by our cellular carrier customers and the general contractors and integrators doing work on their behalf, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. During the second half of fiscal 2017, we saw improved year-over-year quarterly sales in the carrier markets as purchases increased from key contractors and integrators. Revenue in the second half of fiscal 2017 increased 23.0% in the public carrier market as compared to the same period of fiscal 2016 as a result of these increased purchases.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was essentially flat with a 0.2% decrease in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a 9.6% decrease in our public carriers market for fiscal year 2017 as compared\nto fiscal year 2016. This decrease was almost fully offset by increases in gross profit of our government market and our value-added resellers market of 6.8% and 2.0%, respectively. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly to 21.0% in fiscal year 2017, compared to 21.1% in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.\nOur ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions is dependent upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer's or vendor's business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or global financial crisis.\nWe account for inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and as a result write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. These expenses have been less than 1% of overall purchases for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses increased 6.1% during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly from 19.4% in fiscal year 2016 to 20.5% in fiscal year 2017. The following are descriptions of changes in significant components of selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses:\n \u00b7 Marketing expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to direct marketing costs associated with improved design and content of our TESSCO.com website and increased market development funds associated with sales to our retail customers. \n \u00b7 Compensation and benefits expense increased by $4.2 million, or 6.8%, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily related to higher business generation across all markets and operations compensation costs to support the increase in retail sales volume. Additionally, we incurred $0.8 million in onetime severance costs in relation to a restructuring of our sales and product teams. \n \u00b7 Performance bonus expense (including both cash and equity plans) increased by $1.1 million in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase is primarily related to bonuses paid to our former and current CEO related to the transition that occurred during this fiscal year. \n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we received the results of a software license audit conducted by a major software provider. After significant negotiations, we settled the audit for $1.5 million, which was accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The ongoing annual cost from the results of this audit is minimal. \nWe continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. Accordingly, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $674,200 and $637,100 for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively.\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense decreased, from $161,300 in fiscal year 2016 to $58,600 in fiscal year 2017. The decrease is primarily related to the extinguishment of our term loan and lower borrowing levels on our secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowings.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share. The effective tax rates in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 were 41.9% and 39.8%, respectively. The increased rate is primarily a result of lower pre-tax income which increases the impact of non-deductible tax differences. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2017 decreased 72.9% and 73.8%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows:\n\nWe used $9.2 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2018. This outflow was driven by increases in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), and an increase in accounts payable. Increasing sales to our public carrier customers required significant investments in inventory and at times has resulted in larger accounts receivable balances. Accounts payable also increased in response to our higher inventory levels. Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business have required an increase in working capital investments. As such, on October 19, 2017 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed below, based upon our anticipated borrowing and cash needs.\nWe generated $3.1 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2017. This inflow was driven by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and product inventory. Accounts receivable increased due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Inventory and accounts payable increased as a result of strategic purchases combined with a general increase in base station infrastructure inventory for our public system operators, contractors, and program managers market. Additionally, our inventory levels for certain Ventev\u00ae product lines have also increased. The reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as the decrease in accrued expense and other liabilities are both primarily related to a tower owner customer whose inventory we have held on its behalf since fiscal year 2015. Because we held the inventory on the tower owner's behalf, the cost of these goods was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and we were unable to recognize the revenue and related cost of goods sold associated with the transaction until the product physically shipped. During fiscal year 2017, most of the remaining inventory was shipped and therefore the corresponding portion of the deferred revenue and cost of goods sold were partially recognized.\nWe generated $20.1 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016. This inflow was driven by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), a decrease in accounts receivable and product inventory, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expense and other current liabilities. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily related to better collections in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to an effort to reduce overall inventory levels while maintaining high service levels. The reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as the decrease in accrued expense and other liabilities are both primarily related to the tower owner customer referred to above. During fiscal year 2016, the majority of this inventory was shipped and therefore the corresponding portion of deferred revenue and cost of goods sold were partially recognized.\nCapital expenditures of $3.5 million in fiscal year 2018 were up from $2.6 million in fiscal year 2017 and flat with $3.5 million in fiscal year 2016. Fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures were largely comprised of investments in information technology of $2.8 million, $2.4 million, and $3.1 million, respectively.\nCash flows generated from financing in fiscal year 2018 were primarily related to borrowings from our line of\ncredit partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 were primarily related to cash dividends paid to shareholders and the repayment of our term loan which was secured by a first position deed of trust encumbering Company-owned real property in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 were primarily related to cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nOn April 23, 2014, our Board of Directors expanded our then existing stock buyback program and authorized the purchase on a non-accelerated basis of up to $10.0 million of the Company's stock over a 24-month period, ending in April 2016. Our Board of Directors believes that the repurchase of our shares, when appropriate, is an excellent use of funds to enhance long-term shareholder value. Purchases were funded from working capital and/or our revolving credit facility. Shares could be purchased from time to time in the open market, by block purchase, or through negotiated transactions, or other transactions managed by broker-dealers. No shares were repurchased during fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. The stock buyback program expired in April 2016.\nWe also withhold shares from our employees and directors, at their request, equal to the minimum federal and state tax withholdings related to vested equity grants. For fiscal years 2018 and 2017 this totaled $65,400 and $192,400, respectively. Our revolving credit facility", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Part I, Item 1: Business,\u201d Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data,\u201d and Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The various sections of this MD&A contain a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing, including Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors.\u201d Our actual results may differ materially from those described in any such forward-looking statement.\nBusiness Overview and Environment\nTESSCO Technologies Incorporated (TESSCO, we, or the Company) architects and delivers innovative product and value chain solutions to support wireless systems. Although we sell products to customers in almost 100 countries, approximately 98% of our sales are to customers in the United States. We have operations and office facilities in Timonium and Hunt Valley, Maryland, Reno, Nevada and San Antonio, Texas.\nBeginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we modified the structure of our internal organization, in an effort to better serve the market place. Retail inventory typically has a shorter more defined life cycle and is, typically, ultimately used by individual end users. Commercial inventory typically has a life cycle that tends to be tied to changes in regulation or technology and includes products typically used by business entities or governments. Reflective of these differences, our sales and product teams were reorganized and each now reports to either a retail or commercial leader. We concluded that corresponding changes to our reportable segments are warranted and now evaluate our business within two segments: commercial and retail. The commercial segment consists of the following customer markets: (1) public carriers that are generally responsible for building and maintaining the infrastructure system and provide airtime service to individual subscribers; (2) government, including federal agencies and state and local governments that run wireless networks for their own use as well as value-added resellers who specialize in selling to the government; (3) private system operators, including commercial entities such as enterprise customers, major utilities and transportation companies; and (4) value-added resellers that sell, install and/or service cellular telephone, wireless networking, broadband and two-way radio communications equipment primarily for the enterprise market. The retail segment consists of the market which includes retailers, independent dealer agents and carriers. All prior financial periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect this change.\nWe offer a wide range of products that are classified into four business categories: base station infrastructure; network systems; installation, test and maintenance; and mobile devices and accessories. Base infrastructure products are used to build, repair and upgrade wireless telecommunications. Sales of traditional base station infrastructure products, such as base station radios, cable and transmission lines and antennas are in part dependent on capital spending in the wireless communications industry. Network systems products are used to build and upgrade computing and internet networks. We have also been growing our offering of wireless broadband, network equipment, security and surveillance products, which are not as dependent on the overall capital spending of the industry. Installation, test and maintenance products are used to install, tune, and maintain wireless communications equipment. This category is made up of sophisticated analysis equipment and various frequency-, voltage- and power-measuring devices, replacement parts and components as well as an assortment of tools, hardware and supplies required by service technicians. Mobile devices and\naccessory products include cellular phone and data device accessories. Our customers generally have the ability to purchase from any of our product categories.\nThe wireless communications distribution industry is competitive and fragmented, and is comprised of several national distributors. In addition, many manufacturers sell direct. Barriers to entry for distributors are relatively low, particularly in the mobile devices and accessory market, and the risk of new competitors entering the market is high. Consolidation of larger wireless carriers has and will most likely continue to impact our current and potential customer base. In addition, the agreements or arrangements with our customers or vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions are typically of limited duration and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our ability to maintain these relationships is subject to competitive pressures and challenges. We believe, however, that our strength in service, the breadth and depth of our product offering, our information technology system, our large customer base and our purchasing relationships with approximately 440 manufacturers provide us with a significant competitive advantage over new entrants to the market.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables summarize the results of our

to Fiscal Year 2017\nRevenues. Revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased by 8.8% as compared to fiscal year 2017. In the commercial segment, revenue increased by 16.3% with growth in all markets. The public carrier market revenue for fiscal year 2018 increased by 40.3%, as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to increased spending among our tower owner and program manager customers, and also due in part to better execution of our selling strategy in this market. We increased sales with our current customers and cultivated new significant customer relationships. This revenue growth was echoed in our private systems operators market and value-added resellers market with growth of 13.0% and 4.9%, respectively. Revenue from our government market increased by 10.4% due primarily to growth from our federal government customers. The revenue growth within our commercial segment was partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in our retail segment revenue for fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. This decrease was due in part to consolidation of our customer base within the retail market and due to a shift in customer behavior where customers are keeping the same phone for longer periods of time, resulting in lower accessories purchases.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased by 7.6% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. In the commercial segment, gross profit increased by 7.7%. This increase was primarily driven by increases in our public carriers and private systems operators markets of 21.9% and 12.7%, respectively. We experienced margin compression within our public carrier market primarily due to a change in customer mix, with increased sales going to larger customers which required better pricing. Gross profit within our government market increased by 8.7% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. The growth in the public carriers, private systems and government markets was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of 0.6% within our value-added resellers market. Within the retail segment, gross profit increased by 7.4% in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017, despite a decline in revenue. This increase in gross margin was a result of product mix and increased support from our vendors. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly to 20.7% in fiscal year 2018, compared to 21.0% in fiscal year 2017, primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.\nOur ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions is dependent upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer's or vendor's business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or global financial crisis.\nWe account for inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and as a result write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. These expenses have been less than 1% of overall purchases for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses increased 2.8% during fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased from 20.5% in fiscal year 2017 to 19.4% in fiscal year 2018. The following are descriptions of changes in significant components of selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses:\n \u00b7 Performance bonus expense (including both cash and equity plans) increased by $3.0 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. Our bonus programs are typically based on achieving annual performance targets. The relationship between expected performance and actual performance led to higher bonus accruals in fiscal 2018, as compared to fiscal 2017. \n \u00b7 Freight out expense increased by $0.7 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 due to our increased sales. \n \u00b7 Expenses related to information technology increased by $0.7 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017 primarily due to increased cost relating to Tessco.com improvements. \n \u00b7 During fiscal year 2017 we incurred corporate support expenses including both recruiting and professional service fees relating to the transition to our new CEO. As the transition was completed during fiscal 2017, corporate support expense decreased by $0.9 million in fiscal year 2018 as compared to fiscal year 2017. \nWe continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. Accordingly, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $797,100 and $674,200 for fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2017, respectively.\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense increased, from $58,600 in fiscal year 2017 to $429,100 in fiscal year 2018. The increase is primarily related higher borrowing levels on our secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 through 8 to the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowings.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share. The effective tax rates in fiscal year 2018 and 2017 were 30.5% and 41.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower for fiscal 2018, primarily due to the 2017 Tax Act that went into effect in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as a change in treatment of a deferred tax liability relating to our accounting for a key man life insurance policy, discussed below. The 2017 Tax Act requires fiscal year companies to blend their federal tax rates this year. Our annual federal rate for fiscal 2018 will be based on 9 months at the old rate of approximately 35% rate and 3 months at the new 21% rate. We were also able to take a benefit on our net deferred tax liabilities in fiscal 2018, which now reflect the lower federal rate. See Note 13 Income Taxes to the financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the effect of the 2017 Tax Act and the change in treatment of the deferred tax liability. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2018 increased 259.5% and 258.8%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2017.\nAfter we announced our fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 financial results by press release dated May 7, 2018, we determined it necessary to change how we account for the cash surrender value of certain key-man life insurance policies held by us. We had for many years recorded a deferred tax liability related to the incremental increase year over year in the cash surrender value of the policies. After further analysis, it was determined that the annual change in cash surrender value, which has accumulated slowly over many years, should have been treated as an offset to the non-deductible insurance premiums related to the same policies, and not as a deferred tax liability. As such, we adjusted our fiscal 2018 financial results to reflect the favorable change in tax treatment as applied to the aggregate amount of the incremental increases that have accumulated over the multi-year period. Specifically, net deferred tax assets increased by an aggregate of $0.5 million and income tax expense correspondingly decreased by an aggregate of $0.5 million. Correspondingly, net income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased by $0.5 million and $0.06 per share, respectively, due to a one-time adjustment resulting from this change in tax treatment. There was no impact on net cash flow used in operations. This change has no impact on previously filed tax returns.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenues. Revenue for fiscal year 2017 increased slightly by 0.5% as compared to fiscal year 2016. Revenue from our government market increased by 11.1% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. We have continued to invest in this market, which has led to an increase in government contracts, especially with our state and local government customers. Revenues within our private system operators market increased by 7.4% for fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to an increase in sales to our utility customers. Revenue from the public carrier and value-added resellers markets, decreased by 8.0% and 1.4%, respectively, due to a dramatic slowdown in the purchases by our cellular carrier customers and the general contractors and integrators doing work on their behalf, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2015. During the second half of fiscal 2017, we saw improved year-over-year quarterly sales in the carrier markets as purchases increased from key contractors and integrators. Revenue in the second half of fiscal 2017 increased 23.0% in the public carrier market as compared to the same period of fiscal 2016 as a result of these increased purchases.\nGross Profit. Gross profit was essentially flat with a 0.2% decrease in fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. This decrease was primarily driven by a 9.6% decrease in our public carriers market for fiscal year 2017 as compared\nto fiscal year 2016. This decrease was almost fully offset by increases in gross profit of our government market and our value-added resellers market of 6.8% and 2.0%, respectively. Overall gross profit margin decreased slightly to 21.0% in fiscal year 2017, compared to 21.1% in fiscal year 2016, primarily due to changes in customer and product mix.\nOur ongoing ability to earn revenues and gross profits from customers and vendors looking to us for product and supply chain solutions is dependent upon a number of factors. The terms, and accordingly the factors, applicable to each relationship often differ. Among these factors are the strength of the customer's or vendor's business, the supply and demand for the product or service, including price stability, changing customer or vendor requirements, and our ability to support the customer or vendor and to continually demonstrate that we can improve the way they do business. In addition, the agreements or arrangements on which our customer and vendor relationships are based are typically of limited duration, typically do not include any obligation in respect of any specific product purchase or sale and are terminable by either party upon several months or otherwise short notice. Our customer relationships could also be affected by wireless carrier consolidation or global financial crisis.\nWe account for inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and as a result write-offs/write-downs occur due to damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in prices and other causes. These expenses have been less than 1% of overall purchases for each of the last three fiscal years.\nSelling, General, Administrative and Restructuring Expenses. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses increased 6.1% during fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. Total selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly from 19.4% in fiscal year 2016 to 20.5% in fiscal year 2017. The following are descriptions of changes in significant components of selling, general, administrative and restructuring expenses:\n \u00b7 Marketing expenses increased by $1.4 million, or 16.7%, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily due to direct marketing costs associated with improved design and content of our TESSCO.com website and increased market development funds associated with sales to our retail customers. \n \u00b7 Compensation and benefits expense increased by $4.2 million, or 6.8%, in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016, primarily related to higher business generation across all markets and operations compensation costs to support the increase in retail sales volume. Additionally, we incurred $0.8 million in onetime severance costs in relation to a restructuring of our sales and product teams. \n \u00b7 Performance bonus expense (including both cash and equity plans) increased by $1.1 million in fiscal year 2017 as compared to fiscal year 2016. This increase is primarily related to bonuses paid to our former and current CEO related to the transition that occurred during this fiscal year. \n \u00b7 During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we received the results of a software license audit conducted by a major software provider. After significant negotiations, we settled the audit for $1.5 million, which was accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 and was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The ongoing annual cost from the results of this audit is minimal. \nWe continually evaluate the credit worthiness of our existing customer receivable portfolio and provide an appropriate reserve based on this evaluation. We also evaluate the credit worthiness of prospective and current customers and make decisions regarding extension of credit terms to such customers based on this evaluation. Accordingly, we recorded a provision for bad debts of $674,200 and $637,100 for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2016, respectively.\nInterest, Net. Net interest expense decreased, from $161,300 in fiscal year 2016 to $58,600 in fiscal year 2017. The decrease is primarily related to the extinguishment of our term loan and lower borrowing levels on our secured revolving credit facility. Refer to Note 6 through 8 to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our borrowings.\nIncome Taxes, Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share. The effective tax rates in fiscal year 2017 and 2016 were 41.9% and 39.8%, respectively. The increased rate is primarily a result of lower pre-tax income which increases the impact of non-deductible tax differences. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2017 decreased 72.9% and 73.8%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows were as follows:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flow (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(9,247,100)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3,051,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n20,141,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flow used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,539,400)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,563,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,513,800)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash flow provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4,265,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8,831,000)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(7,268,500)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,520,700)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(8,342,700)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9,358,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe used $9.2 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2018. This outflow was driven by increases in accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), and an increase in accounts payable. Increasing sales to our public carrier customers required significant investments in inventory and at times has resulted in larger accounts receivable balances. Accounts payable also increased in response to our higher inventory levels. Both current and potential opportunities within our public carrier business have required an increase in working capital investments. As such, on October 19, 2017 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as discussed below, based upon our anticipated borrowing and cash needs.\nWe generated $3.1 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2017. This inflow was driven by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and product inventory. Accounts receivable increased due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Inventory and accounts payable increased as a result of strategic purchases combined with a general increase in base station infrastructure inventory for our public system operators, contractors, and program managers market. Additionally, our inventory levels for certain Ventev\u00ae product lines have also increased. The reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as the decrease in accrued expense and other liabilities are both primarily related to a tower owner customer whose inventory we have held on its behalf since fiscal year 2015. Because we held the inventory on the tower owner's behalf, the cost of these goods was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and we were unable to recognize the revenue and related cost of goods sold associated with the transaction until the product physically shipped. During fiscal year 2017, most of the remaining inventory was shipped and therefore the corresponding portion of the deferred revenue and cost of goods sold were partially recognized.\nWe generated $20.1 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2016. This inflow was driven by net income (net of depreciation and amortization and non-cash stock compensation expense), a decrease in accounts receivable and product inventory, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expense and other current liabilities. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily related to better collections in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to an effort to reduce overall inventory levels while maintaining high service levels. The reduction in prepaid expenses and other assets as well as the decrease in accrued expense and other liabilities are both primarily related to the tower owner customer referred to above. During fiscal year 2016, the majority of this inventory was shipped and therefore the corresponding portion of deferred revenue and cost of goods sold were partially recognized.\nCapital expenditures of $3.5 million in fiscal year 2018 were up from $2.6 million in fiscal year 2017 and flat with $3.5 million in fiscal year 2016. Fiscal year 2018, 2017 and 2016 capital expenditures were largely comprised of investments in information technology of $2.8 million, $2.4 million, and $3.1 million, respectively.\nCash flows generated from financing in fiscal year 2018 were primarily related to borrowings from our line of\ncredit partially offset by cash dividends paid to shareholders. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2017 were primarily related to cash dividends paid to shareholders and the repayment of our term loan which was secured by a first position deed of trust encumbering Company-owned real property in Hunt Valley, Maryland. Cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2016 were primarily related to cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nOn April 23, 2014, our Board of Directors expanded our then existing stock buyback program and authorized the purchase on a non-accelerated basis of up to $10.0 million of the Company's stock over a 24-month period, ending in April 2016. Our Board of Directors believes that the repurchase of our shares, when appropriate, is an excellent use of funds to enhance long-term shareholder value. Purchases were funded from working capital and/or our revolving credit facility. Shares could be purchased from time to time in the open market, by block purchase, or through negotiated transactions, or other transactions managed by broker-dealers. No shares were repurchased during fiscal years 2018, 2017, or 2016. The stock buyback program expired in April 2016.\nWe also withhold shares from our employees and directors, at their request, equal to the minimum federal and state tax withholdings related to vested equity grants. For fiscal years 2018 and 2017 this totaled $65,400 and $192,400, respectively. Our revolving credit facility"}
