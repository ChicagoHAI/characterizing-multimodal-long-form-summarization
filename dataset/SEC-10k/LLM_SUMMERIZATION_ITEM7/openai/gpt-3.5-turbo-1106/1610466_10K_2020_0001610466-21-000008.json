Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are the analysis of our financial performance, financial condition and significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. It should also be read together with Risk factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842, Leases ( the lease standard\u201d) by applying the modified retrospective approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 and balances at December 31, 2019 are presented in accordance with the lease standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under previous generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). See Note 9 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nPartnership Overview\nWe own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets and logistic assets. As of December 31, 2020, our assets include interests in entities that own (a) crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals that serve as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and deliver refined products from those markets to major demand centers and (b) storage tanks and financing receivables that are secured by pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and other infrastructure used to stage and transport intermediate and finished products. Our assets also include interests in entities that own natural gas and refinery gas pipelines that transport offshore natural gas to market hubs and deliver refinery gas from refineries and plants to chemical sites along the Gulf Coast.\nFor a description of our assets, please see Part I, Item 1 - Business and Properties of this report.\n2020 developments include:\n-Purchase and Sale Agreement. On April 1, 2020, we closed the following transactions (collectively referred to as the April 2020 Transaction\u201d) pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of February 27, 2020 (the Purchase and Sale Agreement\u201d) by and among the Partnership, Triton West LLC ( Triton\u201d), SPLC, Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC ( SGOM\u201d), Shell Chemical LP ( Shell Chemical\u201d) and Equilon Enterprises LLC d/b/a Shell Oil Products US ( SOPUS\u201d):\ni.We acquired 79% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Mattox Pipeline Company LLC from SGOM (the Mattox Transaction\u201d).\nii.SOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred to Triton, as a designee of the Partnership, certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex located in Norco, Louisiana, which are comprised of crude, chemicals, intermediate and finished product pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and supporting infrastructure (such assets, the Norco Assets\u201d and such transaction, the Norco Transaction\u201d).\n-Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement. On April 1, 2020, simultaneously with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we also closed the transactions contemplated by the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement with our general partner, dated as of February 27, 2020 (the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement\u201d), eliminating all incentive distribution rights ( IDRs\u201d) and converting the economic general partner interest in the Partnership into a non-economic general partner interest (the GP/IDR Restructuring\u201d). As consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement, SPLC received 160,000,000 newly issued common units, plus 50,782,904 Series A perpetual convertible preferred units (the Series A Preferred Units\u201d). Our general partner (or its assignee) has also agreed to waive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be payable on the common units issued to SPLC as part of the April 2020 Transaction, in an amount of $20 million per quarter for four consecutive fiscal quarters, beginning with the distribution made with respect to the second quarter of 2020.\nRefer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\nWe generate revenue from the transportation, terminaling and storage of crude oil, refined products, and intermediate and finished products through our pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks, generate income from our equity and other investments, and generate interest income from financing receivables on the Norco Assets. Our revenue is generated from customers in the same industry, our Parent's affiliates, integrated oil companies, marketers and independent exploration, production and refining companies primarily within the Gulf Coast region of the United States. We generally do not own any of the crude oil, refinery gas or refined petroleum products we handle, nor do we engage in the trading of these commodities. We\ntherefore have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term.\nNotable 2020 and certain anticipated 2021 impacts to net income and cash available for distribution ( CAFD\u201d) include:\n\u2022Hurricanes. As a result of several hurricanes, we incurred an impact of approximately $20 million to net income and CAFD in the latter half 2020. Certain producers in the Gulf of Mexico elected to shut-in and evacuate as a safety precaution, while others were forced to shut-in or curtail production due to onshore closures. Further, certain onshore assets were impacted by power outages related to the storms. There was no material impact to our people or assets as a result of the storms.\n\u2022Planned Turnarounds. Certain connected producers had planned turnarounds during 2020. As a result, the impact to net income and CAFD from this turnaround activity was approximately $15 million for the year ended 2020. Further, we anticipate an impact of approximately $10 million to net income and CAFD from planned turnaround activity in 2021.\nThe broader market environment for our customers was challenging in 2019 and continued to be challenging during 2020 given the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted worldwide demand for oil and gas and increased downward pressure on oil prices. The responses of oil and gas producers to the lower demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas are constantly evolving and remain uncertain. The master limited partnership ( MLP\u201d) market has also changed significantly, as capital for high growth fueled by dropdown activity continues to be constrained. We are fortunate to have the support of RDS, who has provided us favorable loan and equity terms, allowing us flexibility to acquire high quality assets from our affiliates. While we expect to retain this flexibility, we anticipate continuing to moderate inorganic growth in our asset base and focusing on the sustainable operation of our core assets, cash preservation and the organic growth of our business in 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nNet income was $556 million and net income attributable to the Partnership was $543 million in 2020. We generated cash from operations of $650 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $320 million, total debt of $2,692 million and unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities of $896 million.\nOur 2020 operations and strategic initiatives demonstrated our continuing focus on our business strategies:\n\u2022Maintain operational excellence through prioritization of safety, reliability and efficiency;\n\u2022Enhanced focus on cash optimization and reduced discretionary project spend;\n\u2022Focus on advantageous commercial agreements with creditworthy counterparties to enhance financial results and deliver reliable distribution growth over the long-term; and\n\u2022Optimize existing assets and pursue organic growth opportunities.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) revenue (including pipeline loss allowance ( PLA\u201d) from contracted capacity and throughput); (ii) operations and maintenance expenses (including capital expenses); (iii) Adjusted EBITDA (defined below); and (iv) CAFD.\nContracted Capacity and Throughput\nThe amount of revenue our assets generate primarily depends on our transportation and storage services agreements with shippers and the volumes of crude oil, refinery gas and refined products that we handle through our pipelines, terminals and storage tanks.\nThe commitments under our transportation, terminaling and storage services agreements with shippers and the volumes we handle in our pipelines and storage tanks are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, refinery gas, natural gas and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. This supply and demand is impacted by the market prices for these products in the markets we serve. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant disruptions in the U.S. economy and financial and energy markets, including substantial demand destruction in the oil and gas markets. Responses of oil and gas producers to the lower demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas are constantly evolving and unpredictable, but further or continued decreases in demand (including due to renewed economic shutdowns and restrictions in response to increased COVID-19 infection rates) could force producers to shut-in certain wellheads or otherwise cease or curtail their operations. It also could reduce the volumes running through our pipelines and terminals.\nWe utilize the commercial arrangements we believe are the most prudent under the market conditions to deliver on our business strategy. The results of our operations will be impacted by our ability to:\n\u2022maintain utilization of and rates charged for our pipelines and storage facilities;\n\u2022utilize the remaining uncommitted capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems;\n\u2022increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third-party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products; and\n\u2022identify and execute organic expansion projects.\nOperations and Maintenance Expenses\nOur operations and maintenance expenses consist primarily of:\n\u2022labor expenses (including contractor services);\n\u2022insurance costs (including coverage for our consolidated assets and operated joint ventures);\n\u2022utility costs (including electricity and fuel);\n\u2022repairs and maintenance expenses; and\n\u2022major maintenance costs (related to the terminaling service agreements of the Norco Assets, which are expensed as incurred because the Partnership does not own the related assets).\nCertain costs naturally fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle, whereas other costs generally remain stable across broad ranges of throughput and storage volumes, but can vary depending upon the level of both planned and unplanned maintenance activity in the particular period. Our maintenance activity can be impacted by events such as turnarounds, asset integrity work and storms.\nOur management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing operations and maintenance expenses. For example, our property and business interruption insurance is provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell, which results in cost savings and improved coverage. Further, we, along with our Parent, are currently undertaking an initiative to reduce operational costs. We expect that some of these activities, such as re-scoping and/or deferring projects, evaluating third-party service contracts and reducing the use of contractors, will directly benefit our assets and their contribution to our net income. Other activities, such as the streamlining of structure and processes at the Parent level, will result in a reduction of certain costs and fees for which we reimburse and pay SPLC. While cost effectiveness has always been a focus of the business, it is of increased importance given the current operating environment.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nAdjusted EBITDA and CAFD have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or CAFD in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Please refer to Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for the reconciliation of GAAP measures net income and cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, gain or loss from dispositions of fixed assets, allowance oil reduction to net realizable value, loss from revision of asset retirement obligation, and depreciation, amortization and accretion, plus cash distributed to us from equity method investments for the applicable period, less equity method distributions included in other income and income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parent.\nWe define CAFD as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid by the Partnership, cash reserves, income taxes paid and Series A Preferred Unit distributions, plus net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership, reimbursements from Parent included in partners' capital, principal and interest payments received on financing receivables and certain one-time payments received. CAFD will not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nThe definition of CAFD was updated for the second quarter of 2020 due to the closing of the April 2020 Transaction, which resulted in part in the transfer of the Norco Assets to be accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard. As a result, the Partnership recognized financing receivables from SOPUS and Shell Chemical. These assets impact CAFD since principal payments on the financing receivables are not included in net income. As a result, such principal and interest payments on the financing receivables have been included as an adjustment to CAFD since the second quarter of 2020. Also as partial consideration for the April 2020 Transaction, SPLC received 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units. The distributions on these Series A Preferred Units have been deducted from CAFD since the second quarter of 2020.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP supplemental financial measures provides useful information to management and investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA and CAFD are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n\u2022our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;\n\u2022the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;\n\u2022our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nFactors Affecting Our Business and Outlook\nWe believe key factors that impact our business are the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, refinery gas and refined products in the markets in which our business operates. We also believe that our customers' requirements, competition and government regulation of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and refinery gas play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies. In addition, acquisition opportunities, whether from Shell or third parties, and financing options, will also impact our business. These factors are discussed in more detail below.\nChanges in Crude Oil Sourcing and Refined Product Demand Dynamics\nTo effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil and refined products supply and demand. Changes in crude oil supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields, operational impacts at producer fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil supply affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. In addition, general economic, broad market and worldwide health considerations, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, can also affect sourcing and demand dynamics for our services.\nOne of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline systems is their ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply markets to key refining centers along the Gulf Coast. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. They also occasionally choose to store crude longer term when the forward price is higher than the current price (a contango market\u201d). While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported or stored are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our total crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics, including the demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as U.S. exports.\nSimilarly, our refined products pipelines have the ability to serve multiple major demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipelines, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our various pipelines, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products supply and demand dynamics, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand can also be greatly affected by refinery performance in the end market, as refined products pipeline demand will increase to fill the supply gap created by refinery issues.\nWe can also be constrained by asset integrity considerations in the volumes we ship. We may elect to reduce cycling on our systems to reduce asset integrity risk, which in turn would likely result in lower revenues.\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers and to create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements. For example, production from Shell's Appomattox platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which came online during 2019, tied into our existing Proteus and Endymion systems to bring crude onshore. Similarly, we expect to continue extending our corridor pipelines to provide developing growth regions in the Gulf of Mexico with access via our existing corridors to onshore refining centers and market hubs. By way of example, in the latter part of 2019 we announced a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the Mars system to address growing production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico regions served by Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022. We believe this strategy will allow our offshore business to grow profitably throughout demand cycles.\nChanges in Customer Contracting\nWe generate a portion of our revenue under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers, including ship-or-pay agreements and life-of-lease transportation agreements, some of which provide a guaranteed return, and storage service agreements with marketers, pipelines and refiners. Historically, the commercial terms of these long-term transportation and storage service agreements have substantially mitigated volatility in our financial results by limiting our direct exposure to reductions in volumes due to supply or demand variability. Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to renew or replace our contract portfolio on comparable terms, by sustained downturns or sluggishness in commodity prices, or the economy in general (as with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on the demand for oil and gas), and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our operations. Our business can also be impacted by asset integrity or customer interruptions and natural disasters or other events that could lead customers to invoke force majeure or other defenses to avoid contractual performance.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Zydeco recontracted previously expired volumes under certain of its throughput and deficiency agreements ( T&D agreements\u201d). Although we replaced the volumes, the rates under the new T&D agreements were lower than those previously contracted. Two of these T&D agreements expired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and have not been replaced. The T&D agreements that expired accounted for less than 10% of our revenue for 2020. There are several ways in which this revenue could be replaced in the future, such as through re-contracting or spot shipments, the outcome of which will be dependent on market and customer dynamics.\nThe market environment at any given time will dictate the rates, terms and duration of agreements that shippers are willing to enter into, as well as the contracts that best satisfy the needs of our business. As we have grown and diversified our business over the past several years, and as recently as the second quarter of 2020 with the April 2020 Transaction, we have benefited from shifting reliance away from the results of any one asset. While Zydeco continues to serve an important market, and we strive to maximize the long-term value of the system to both shippers and the pipeline, we will continue to diversify our risk across products, customers and geographies.\nChanges in Commodity Prices and Customers' Volumes\nCrude oil prices have fluctuated significantly over the past few years, often with drastic moves in relatively short periods of time. During 2020, the demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas decreased significantly due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental regulations and travel restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. The current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty continues to contribute to future volatility in financial and commodity markets. Our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the PLA provisions in our tariffs. Indirectly, global demand for refined products and chemicals could impact our terminal operations and refined products and refinery gas pipelines, as well as our crude pipelines that feed U.S. manufacturing demand. Likewise, changes in the global market for crude oil could affect our crude oil pipeline and terminals and require expansion capital expenditures to reach\ngrowing export hubs. Demand for crude oil, refined products and refinery gas may decline in the areas we serve as a result of decreased production by our customers, depressed commodity prices, decreased third-party investment in the industry, increased competition and other adverse economic factors such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, which affect the exploration, production and refining industries. Although we have seen the earlier depressed demand due to the pandemic for crude oil and refined products level off, further increases in COVID-19 infection rates could have additional negative impacts on demand. This could force producers to shut-in certain wellheads or otherwise cease or curtail their operations. It also could reduce the volumes running through our pipelines and terminals. However, fixed contracts with volume minimums and demand for tanks for storage are expected to moderate any impact on our terminaling and storage service revenue.\nCertain of our assets benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements and are strategically positioned to connect crude oil volumes originating from key onshore and offshore production basins to the Texas and Louisiana refining markets, where demand for throughput has remained strong. Historically, we have not experienced a material decline in throughput volumes on our crude oil pipeline systems as a result of lower crude oil prices. However, if crude oil prices remain at lower levels for a sustained period due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, we will continue to see a reduction in our transportation volumes if production coming into our systems is deferred and our associated allowance oil sales decrease. Our customers may also experience liquidity and credit problems or other unexpected events, which could cause them to defer development or repair projects, avoid our contracts in bankruptcy, invoke force majeure clauses or other defenses to avoid contractual performance or renegotiate our contracts on terms that are less attractive to us or impair their ability to perform under our contracts.\nOur throughput volumes on our refined products pipeline systems depend primarily on the volume of refined products produced at connected refineries and the desirability of our end markets. These factors in turn are driven by refining margins, maintenance schedules and market differentials. Refining margins depend on the cost of crude oil or other feedstocks and the price of refined products, which have decreased significantly during 2020. These margins are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for crude oil and refined products. Our refined products pipelines are continuing to experience demand destruction in the near term due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a significant decrease in consumer demand for refined products such as gasoline and jet fuel.\nOther Changes in Customers' Volumes\nOnshore crude transportation volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOffshore crude transportation volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to planned maintenance activities, storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico and delays to new wells or well work overs due to storm activity.\nOnshore terminaling and storage volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to lower volume throughput from our customers as a result of the demand destruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMajor Maintenance Projects\nAt the end of 2019, we finalized a directional drill project on the Zydeco pipeline system to address soil erosion over a two-mile section of our 22-inch diameter pipeline under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer in Louisiana (the directional drill project\u201d). Zydeco incurred approximately $42 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the total directional drill project. In connection with the acquisitions of additional interests in Zydeco, SPLC agreed to reimburse us against our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses with respect to this project. Costs incurred and reimbursed during 2020 were not material.\nDuring 2020, we incurred costs related to the Bessie Heights project ( Bessie Heights\u201d), which is a directional drill project on the Zydeco pipeline system to replace an exposed and suspended 22-inch diameter pipe in the low-lying marsh area between Bird Island and Bridge City, Texas, as well as to replace lap welded pipe below the Neches River. Zydeco incurred approximately $13 million in maintenance capital expenditures in 2020 to complete the project. Any remaining spend in the first quarter of 2021 is not expected to be material.\nFor expected capital expenditures in 2020, refer to Capital Resources and Liquidity - Capital Expenditures and Investments.\nMajor Expansion Projects\nOn Mars, we announced in the latter part of 2019 a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the system. Letters of intent are in place, and we are now progressing definitive agreements with producers and expect to complete them by the end of the first quarter of 2021. SPLC has elected to fund the installation of the equipment necessary to enable greater throughput\nvolumes on the system, but the revenue associated with increased throughput volumes will benefit Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022.\nCustomers\nWe transport and store crude oil, refined products, natural gas and refinery gas for a broad mix of customers, including producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and are connected to other crude oil and refined products pipelines. In addition to serving directly-connected U.S. Gulf Coast markets, our crude oil and refined products pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation and storage services for a variety of reasons. Refiners typically require a secure and reliable supply of crude oil over a prolonged period of time to meet the needs of their specified refining diet and frequently enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure a ready supply of crude oil, rate surety and sometimes sufficient transportation capacity over the life of the contract. Similarly, chemical sites require a secure and reliable supply of refinery gas to crackers and enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure steady supply. Producers of crude oil and natural gas require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greater market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil and refined products to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil and refined products supply and demand dynamics in our markets. Refer to Note 14 - Transactions with Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.\nCompetition\nOur pipeline systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and with marine and rail transportation. Some of our competitors may expand or construct transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. For example, newly constructed transportation systems in the onshore Gulf of Mexico region may increase competition in the markets where our pipelines operate. In addition, future pipeline transportation capacity could be constructed in excess of actual demand in the market areas we serve, which could reduce the demand for our services, and could lead to the reduction of the rates that we receive for our services. While we do see some variation from quarter-to quarter resulting from changes in our customers' demand for transportation, this risk has historically been mitigated by the long-term, fixed rate basis upon which we have contracted a substantial portion of our capacity.\nOur storage terminal competes with surrounding providers of storage tank services. Some of our competitors have expanded terminals and built new pipeline connections, and third parties may construct pipelines that bypass our location. These, or similar events, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur refined products terminals generally compete with other terminals that serve the same markets. These terminals may be owned by major integrated oil and gas companies or by independent terminaling companies. While fees for terminal storage and throughput services are not regulated, they are subject to competition from other terminals serving the same markets. However, our contracts provide for stable, long-term revenue, which is not impacted by market competitive forces.\nRegulation\nOur assets are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies; for example, our interstate common carrier pipeline systems are subject to economic regulation by FERC. Intrastate pipeline systems are regulated by the appropriate state agency.\nIn May 2020, Zydeco, Mars, LOCAP and Colonial filed with FERC to increase rates subject to FERC's indexing adjustment methodology by approximately 2.0% starting on July 1, 2020. Rate complaints are currently pending at FERC in Docket Nos. OR18-7-002, et al. challenging Colonial's tariff rates, its market power and its practices and charges related to transmix and product volume loss. While certain procedural deadlines have been extended as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, an initial decision by the administrative law judge in this proceeding is currently scheduled for August 2021. A FERC decision is anticipated by spring 2022.\nOn May 21, 2020, FERC issued a Policy Statement resolving the Notice of Inquiry ( NOI\u201d) in Docket No. PL19-4-000. The Policy Statement revises FERC's methodology for calculating the return on equity ( ROE\u201d) component of cost-of-service - based rates to include the Capital Asset Pricing Model ( CAPM\u201d). FERC's use of the discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) methodology will continue to be used, but in equal weighting with CAPM. In the Policy Statement, FERC also clarified certain aspects of its requirements regarding proxy group composition and treatment of outliers. Finally, FERC encouraged carriers to\nrefile their 2019 FERC Form No. 6 either revising their ROE to include the CAPM model or stating that they used the DCF model.\nOn July 18, 2018, FERC issued Order No. 849, which adopts procedures to address the impact of the federal legislation passed on December 22, 2017 known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( TCJA\u201d) and FERC's Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes in Docket No. PL17-1-000, issued on March 15, 2018 (the Revised Policy Statement\u201d). FERC contemporaneously issued the Order on Rehearing in Docket No. PL17-1-000, which affirms FERC's position in the Revised Policy Statement that eliminated the recovery of an income tax allowance by MLP oil and gas pipelines in cost-of-service-based rates. In Order No. 849, however, FERC has clarified its general disallowance of MLP income tax allowance recovery by providing that an MLP will not be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance. FERC will permit an MLP to demonstrate that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a double recovery of investors' income tax costs.\u201d FERC affirmed Order No. 849 on rehearing on April 18, 2019. Parties sought judicial review of the Revised Policy Statement, and that challenge, initially filed in March 2019, was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on August 14, 2020. No further petitions are outstanding on this matter.\nAs was the case with the Revised Policy Statement, FERC did not propose any industry-wide action regarding review of rates for crude oil and liquids pipelines in its July 2018 issuances. MLP owned crude oil and liquids pipelines are required to report Page 700 information in their FERC Form 6 annual reports. Both the elimination of the income tax allowance, as well as the corporate income tax reduction enacted as part of the TCJA, were considered by FERC in the order on the five-year review that was issued on December 17, 2020, although FERC declined in that order to incorporate the effect of the income tax allowance elimination in setting the new indexing adjustment. FERC will also implement the elimination of the income tax allowance in proceedings involving review of initial cost-of-service rates, rate changes and rate complaints. For crude oil and liquids pipelines owned by non-MLP partnerships and other pass-through businesses, FERC will address such issues as they arise in subsequent proceedings.\nOn June 18, 2020, FERC issued a NOI as Docket No. RM20-14-000 regarding the five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index formula. FERC proposed a new formula of Producer Price Index for Finished Goods ( PPI-FG\u201d) plus 0.09% based on its review of industry data provided in the annual FERC Form 6 reports from 2014 through 2019. The NOI proposal, which would take effect in July 2021, would change the current five-year formula from PPI-FG plus 1.23%. FERC invited comments regarding its proposal and any alternative methodologies for calculating the index level, including issues such as different data trimming methodologies and whether it should reflect the effects of any cost-of-service policy changes in the calculation of the index level. Comments on the NOI were filed by multiple parties by August 17, 2020, and reply comments were filed by September 11, 2020. After reviewing the comments and reply comments by interested parties, FERC issued an order on December 17, 2020 adopting a new formula of PPI-FG plus 0.78% for the next five-year period commencing on July 1, 2021. This order is subject to rehearing and possible judicial review.\nWe believe that the recent issuances from FERC, including the Revised Policy Statement and issuances in July 2018, will not have a material impact on our operations and financial performance. Since FERC only maintains jurisdiction over interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the recent decisions are not expected to have an impact on rates charged through our offshore operations. FERC also does not maintain jurisdiction over certain of the onshore assets in which we have interests. Rates related to these assets should not be impacted by FERC's decision. For our FERC-regulated rates charged through our interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the rates are based on either a negotiated or market-based rate and are not set through cost-of-service ratemaking subject to FERC's approval, which are below the cost-of-service rates established by FERC. As such, neither our negotiated nor market-based rate revenue for our FERC-regulated assets would be subject to the income tax recovery disallowance. Additionally, we have evaluated the impact of FERC's recent policy changes on our non-operated joint ventures. Due to the nature of their assets, operations and/or their entity form, we do not believe there will be any material impact to their operations and earnings.\nOn October 20, 2016, FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket No. RM17-1-000 (the ANOPR\u201d) regarding changes to the oil pipeline rate index methodology and data reporting on Page 700 of FERC's Form No. 6. On February 21, 2020, FERC withdrew the ANOPR and denied additional shipper requests seeking changes to Page 700 reporting requirements as the ANOPR's proposed changes were not consistent with FERC's simplified and streamlined indexing regime. No further updates are expected on this matter.\nOn October 1, 2019, PHMSA issued three new final rules. One rule establishes procedures to implement the expanded emergency order enforcement authority set forth in an October 2016 interim final rule. Among other things, this rule allows PHMSA to issue an emergency order without advance notice or opportunity for a hearing. The other two rules impose several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The rule concerning gas transmission extends the requirement to conduct integrity assessments beyond HCAs to pipelines in Moderate Consequence\nAreas ( MCAs\u201d). It also includes requirements to reconfirm maximum allowable operating pressure ( MAOP\u201d), report MAOP exceedances, consider seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management and use certain safety features on in-line inspection equipment. The rule concerning hazardous liquids extends the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity fed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events and adds a requirement to make all onshore lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years. There are new MCAs on some of our gas transmission lines; however, these lines are already fully inspected due to HCAs on the lines, so these new areas do not impact inspection or maintenance programs on the lines. On the liquids side, all onshore lines have leak detection and are currently inspected under our Integrity Management Program, so there are no new inspections required. Some of our product lines may need to be made piggable; however, the full evaluations of those lines have not been completed to understand potential cost implications.\nAcquisition Opportunities\nWe may pursue acquisitions of complementary assets from Shell, as well as from third parties. We also may pursue acquisitions jointly with Shell. Given the size and scope of Shell's footprint and its significant ownership interest in us, we expect acquisitions from Shell will be a growth mechanism for the foreseeable future. However, Shell and its affiliates are under no obligation to sell or offer to sell us additional assets or to pursue acquisitions jointly with us, and we are under no obligation to buy any additional assets from them or to pursue any joint acquisitions with them. We will continue to focus our acquisition strategy on transportation and midstream assets. We believe that we would be well positioned to acquire midstream assets from Shell, as well as from third parties, should such opportunities arise. Identifying and executing acquisitions is a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or if we incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the acquisitions, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash. Our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may also directly impact our ability to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions. The level of current market demand for equity issued by MLPs may make it more challenging for us to fund our acquisitions with the issuance of equity in the capital markets. However, we believe our balance sheet offers us flexibility, providing us other financing options such as hybrid securities, purchases of common units by RDS and debt. While we expect to retain this flexibility, in 2021 we anticipate continuing to moderate inorganic growth in our asset base and focusing on the sustainable operation of our core assets, cash preservation and organic growth of our business.\nResults of Operations\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Operations for 2020 and 2019. A discussion of changes in our Results of Operations and Capital Resources and Liquidity - Cash Flows from Our Operations from 2018 to 2019 has been omitted from the Form 10-K, but may be found in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020.\n2020 Compared to 2019\nRevenues\nTotal revenue decreased by $22 million in 2020 as compared to 2019, comprised of decreases of $53 million in transportation services revenue, $12 million in allowance oil revenue and $21 million attributable to product revenue, partially offset by increases of $63 million attributable to terminaling services revenue and $1 million in lease revenue.\nTransportation services revenue decreased primarily due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the crude and refined products operating environment and related prices in 2020, as well as lower rates on the Zydeco committed contracts in 2020 as compared to 2019. Additionally, the impact from planned turnaround activities, as well as the impact of storms and the related shut-ins of production, was higher in 2020 than 2019. Further, deficiency credits were primarily deferred in 2020 as compared to deficiency credits being utilized and recognized in revenue in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as achieving regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020.\nTerminaling services revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the service components of the new terminaling service agreement related to the Norco Assets acquired in April 2020.\nLease revenue was relatively consistent in 2020 and 2019.\nProduct revenue decreased as a result of lower sales of allowance oil for certain of our onshore and offshore crude pipelines in 2020 as compared to 2019.\nCosts and Expenses\nTotal costs and expenses increased $24 million in 2020 primarily due to the increases of $38 million in operations and maintenance expenses, $3 million in property taxes and $1 million of depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $12 million in cost of products sold, $4 million in general and administrative expenses and $2 million of loss from the revision of asset retirement obligations and disposition of assets incurred in 2019.\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased mainly as a result of higher maintenance costs related to the Norco Assets\nin 2020 as compared to 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased primarily due to reduced contractor spend in 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by higher severance charges in 2020.\nProperty tax expense increased as a result of the acquisition of the Norco Assets in April 2020 and was partially offset by\nchanges in property tax appraisal estimates.\nCost of product sold decreased as a result of lower sales of allowance oil coupled with the lower cost environment in 2020 as compared to 2019, which was partially offset by a higher net realizable value adjustment on allowance oil inventory in 2020.\nInvestment, Dividend and Other Income\nInvestment, dividend and other income increased $34 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. Income from equity method investments increased by $44 million, primarily as a result of the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14 million due to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 following the acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019. We were entitled to distributions from Explorer and Colonial with respect to the period beginning April 1, 2019, as these were paid after the acquisition date and were no longer considered dividend income. Additionally, Other income increased by $4 million related to higher distributions from Poseidon in 2020.\nInterest Income and Expense\nInterest income was $19 million higher mainly due to interest income related to the financing receivables recorded in\nconnection with the Norco Assets. Interest expense decreased by $3 million due to lower interest rates in 2020 versus 2019 resulting from the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market interest rates, which was partially offset by additional borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities during 2020 versus 2019.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nWe expect our ongoing sources of liquidity to include cash generated from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets. We believe this access to credit along with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our short-term working capital requirements and long-term capital expenditure requirements, and to make quarterly cash distributions. However, we cannot accurately predict the effects of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic on our capital resources and liquidity due to the current significant level of uncertainty. Our liquidity as of December 31, 2020 was $1,216 million consisting of $320 million cash on hand and $896 million available capacity under our revolving credit facilities.\nOn April 1, 2020, we closed the transactions contemplated by the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement, which included the elimination of all the IDRs, the conversion of the economic general partner interest into a non-economic general partner interest and the establishment of the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Units in the Partnership's Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, effective as of April 1, 2020. Pursuant to the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement, our general partner (or its assignee) has agreed to waive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be payable on the common units issued to SPLC as part of the April 2020 Transaction, in an amount of $20 million per quarter for four consecutive fiscal quarters, beginning with the distribution made with respect to the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\nOn August 1, 2019, Zydeco entered into a senior unsecured revolving loan facility agreement with Shell Treasury Center (West) Inc. ( STCW\u201d), effective August 6, 2019 (the 2019 Zydeco Revolver\u201d). The 2019 Zydeco Revolver has a borrowing capacity of $30 million and matures on August 6, 2024. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin or, in certain instances, including if LIBOR is discontinued, STCW may specify another benchmark rate generally accepted in the loan market to apply in relation to the advances in place of LIBOR. No issuance fee was incurred in connection with the 2019 Zydeco Revolver.\nOn June 4, 2019, we entered into the Ten Year Fixed Facility, which bears an interest rate of 4.18% per annum and matures on June 4, 2029. No issuance fee was incurred in connection with the Ten Year Fixed Facility. The Ten Year Fixed Facility contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the lender to accelerate the maturity date of amounts borrowed under the Ten Year Fixed Facility. The Ten Year Fixed Facility was fully drawn on June 6, 2019 to partially fund our acquisition of SPLC's remaining 25.97% ownership interest in Explorer and 10.125% ownership interest in Colonial for consideration valued at $800 million on June 6, 2019 (the June 2019 Acquisition\u201d).\nDuring 2018, we negotiated with STCW to increase our borrowing capacity by $600 million through the addition of the Seven Year Fixed Facility effective July 31, 2018. The Seven Year Fixed Facility was fully drawn on August 1, 2018, and the borrowings were used to partially repay borrowings under the Five Year Revolver due December 2022.\nAdditionally, on August 1, 2018, we amended and restated the Five Year Revolver due October 2019 such that the facility will now mature on July 31, 2023 and is now referred to as the Five Year Revolver due July 2023.\nCredit Facility Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have entered into the following credit facilities:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Capacity </td> <td> </td> <td>Current Interest Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Maturity Date </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ten Year Fixed Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>June 4, 2029 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Seven Year Fixed Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>July 31, 2025 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five Year Revolver due July 2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>July 31, 2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five Year Revolver due December 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>December 1, 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Five Year Fixed Facility </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>March 1, 2022 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019 Zydeco Revolver (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>August 6, 2024 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Effective August 6, 2019, the senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement between Zydeco and STCW, dated August 6, 2014, expired. In its place, Zydeco entered into the 2019 Zydeco Revolver. See above for additional information.\nBorrowings under the Five Year Revolver due July 2023, the Five Year Revolver due December 2022 and the 2019 Zydeco Revolver bear interest at the three-month LIBOR rate plus a margin or, in certain instances (including if LIBOR is discontinued) at an alternate interest rate as described in each respective revolver. Over the next few years, LIBOR will be discontinued globally, and as such, a new benchmark will take its place. We are in discussion with our Parent to further clarify the reference rate(s) applicable to our revolving credit facilities once LIBOR is discontinued, and we are evaluating any potential impact on our facilities.\nOur weighted average interest rate for 2020 and 2019 was 3.3% and 3.8%, respectively. The weighted average interest rate includes drawn and undrawn interest fees, but does not consider the amortization of debt issuance costs or capitalized interest. A 1/8 percentage point (12.5 basis points) increase in the interest rate on the total variable rate debt of $894 million as of December 31, 2020 would increase our consolidated annual interest expense by approximately $1 million.\nWe will need to rely on the willingness and ability of our related party lender to secure additional debt, our ability to use cash from operations and/or obtain new debt from other sources to repay/refinance such loans when they come due and/or to secure additional debt as needed.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities, and Zydeco was in compliance with the covenants contained in the 2019 Zydeco Revolver.\nFor definitions and additional information on our credit facilities, refer to Note 8 - Related Party Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nEquity Issuances\nAs consideration for the April 2020 Transaction, the Partnership issued 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units to SPLC at a price of $23.63 per unit, plus 160,000,000 newly issued common units.\nOn June 6, 2019, in connection with the June 2019 Acquisition, we issued 9,477,756 common units to Shell Midstream LP Holdings LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Shell. In connection with the issuance of the common units, we issued 193,424 general partner units to our general partner in order to maintain its 2% general partner interest in us. The non-cash equity consideration from this issuance was valued at $200 million pursuant to the May 2019 Contribution Agreement and was used to partially fund the June 2019 Acquisition.\nOn February 6, 2018, we completed the sale of 25,000,000 common units in a registered public offering for approximately $673 million net proceeds. Additionally, we completed the sale of 11,029,412 common units in a private placement with Shell Midstream LP Holdings LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Shell, for an aggregate purchase price of $300 million. See Note 11 - (Deficit) Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.\nCash Flows from Our Operations\nOperating Activities. We generated $650 million in cash flow from operating activities in 2020 compared to $597 million in 2019. The increase in cash flows was primarily driven by an increase in equity investment income related to the acquisition of\nan interest in Mattox in April 2020 and additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as an increase related to deferred revenue in 2020. These increases were partially offset by the timing of certain prepaid expenses in 2020.\nInvesting Activities. Our cash flow provided by investing activities was $64 million in 2020 compared to $87 million used in investing activities in 2019. The increase in cash flow provided by investing activities was primarily due to no cash acquisition from Parent, no contributions to investment, lower capital expenditures and higher return of investment in 2020 compared to 2019.\nFinancing Activities. Our cash flow used in financing activities was $684 million in 2020 compared to $428 million in 2019. The increase in cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to increased distributions paid to the unitholders and our general partner, no borrowings under credit facilities and lower other contributions from Parent in 2020 compared to 2019. These increases were partially offset by there being no capital distributions to our general partner in 2020.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nOur operations can be capital intensive, requiring investments to maintain, expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and operational regulations. Our capital requirements consist of maintenance capital expenditures and expansion capital expenditures. Examples of maintenance capital expenditures are those made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets, to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives, or other capital expenditures that are incurred in maintaining existing system volumes and related cash flows. In contrast, expansion capital expenditures are those made to acquire additional assets to grow our business, to expand and upgrade our systems and facilities and to construct or acquire new systems or facilities. We regularly explore opportunities to improve service to our customers and maintain or increase our assets' capacity and revenue. We may incur substantial amounts of capital expenditures in certain periods in connection with large maintenance projects that are intended to only maintain our assets' capacity or revenue.\nWe incurred capital expenditures of $22 million, $35 million and $51 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures from 2019 to 2020 is primarily due to completion of the Houma tank expansion and directional drill projects for Zydeco. Further, we had no contributions to investment in 2020.\nA summary of our capital expenditures is shown in the table below:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expansion capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures paid </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Decrease) increase in accrued capital expenditures </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures incurred </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions to investment </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect total capital expenditures and investments to be approximately $21 million for 2021, a summary of which is shown in table below:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Actual Capital Expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>Expected Capital Expenditures </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expansion capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Triton </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total expansion capital expenditures incurred </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zydeco </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pecten </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Triton </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total maintenance capital expenditures incurred </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contributions to investment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures and investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpansion and Maintenance Expenditures\nZydeco's maintenance capital expenditures for 2020 were $19 million, primarily for Bessie Heights, as well as an upgrade of the motor control center at Houma and various other maintenance projects. We expect Zydeco's maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $11 million for 2021, of which $6 million is related to an upgrade of the motor control center at Houma, $2 million is related to Houma tank maintenance projects and $1 million is for replacement of a loading arm at the Houma dock facility. The remaining spend is related to routine maintenance.\nPecten's maintenance capital expenditures for 2020 were $1 million, and we expect Pecten's maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $2 million in 2021 related to a Lockport tank maintenance project and various improvements on Delta.\nTriton's maintenance capital expenditures for 2020 were $1 million, and we expect Triton's maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately $4 million in 2021. The expected 2021 spend is related to Des Plaines fire prevention and protection upgrades, Seattle terminal dock line repair and replacement and routine maintenance at the various terminals.\nWe do not expect any maintenance capital expenditures for Sand Dollar or Odyssey in 2021.\nWe anticipate that both maintenance and expansion capital expenditures for 2021 will be funded primarily with cash from operations.\nCapital Contributions\nIn accordance with the Member Interest Purchase Agreement dated October 16, 2017 pursuant to which we acquired a 50% interest in Permian Basin, we will make capital contributions for our pro rata interest in Permian Basin to fund capital and other expenditures, as approved by supermajority (75%) vote of the members. We made no capital contributions in 2020, and expect to make capital contributions of $4 million in 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nA summary of our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 is shown in the table below:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 2 to 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Years 4 to 5 </td> <td> </td> <td>More than 5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases for land and platform space </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance leases (1)\n</td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other agreements (2)\n</td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligation (3)\n</td> <td>2,694 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on debt (4)\n</td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Finance leases include Port Neches storage tanks and Garden Banks 128 A\u201d platform. Finance leases include $24 million in interest, $24 million in principal and $8 million in executory costs.\n(2) Includes a joint tariff agreement and Odyssey tie-in agreement.\n(3) See Note 8 - Related Party Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.\n(4) Interest payments were calculated based on rates in effect at December 31, 2020 for variable rate borrowings.\nOn April 1, 2020, as partial consideration for the April 2020 Transaction, we issued 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units to SPLC at a price of $23.63 per preferred unit. Our Series A Preferred Units are contractually entitled to receive cumulative quarterly distributions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, cumulative preferred distributions paid to our Series A Preferred Unitholders were $36 million. However, subject to certain conditions, we or the holders of the Series A Preferred Units may convert the Series A Preferred Units into common units at certain anniversary dates after the issuance date. Due to the uncertain timing of any potential conversion, distributions related to the Series A Preferred Units were not included in the contractual obligations table above.\nOdyssey entered into an operating lease dated May 12, 1999 with a third party for usage of offshore platform space at Main Pass 289C. Additionally, Odyssey entered into a tie-in agreement effective January 2012 with a third party, which allowed\nproducers to install the tie-in connection facilities and tying into the system. The agreements will continue to be in effect until the continued operation of the platform is uneconomic.\nOn December 1, 2014, we entered into a terminal services agreement with a related party in which we were to take possession of certain storage tanks located in Port Neches, Texas, effective December 1, 2015. On October 26, 2015, the terminal services agreement was amended to provide for an interim in-service period for the purposes of commissioning the tanks in which we paid a nominal monthly fee. Our capitalized costs and related capital lease obligation commenced effective December 1, 2015, and the storage tanks were placed in-service on September 1, 2016. Under this agreement, in the eighteenth month after the in-service date, actual fixed and variable costs could be compared to premised costs. If the actual and premised operating costs differ by more than 5%, the lease would be adjusted accordingly, and this adjustment will be effective for the remainder of the lease. No adjustment has been made to date. The imputed interest rate on the capital portion of the lease is 15%.\nOn September 1, 2016, which is the in-service date of the capital lease for the Port Neches storage tanks, a joint tariff agreement with a third party became effective. The tariff will be reviewed annually and the rate updated based on FERC's indexing adjustment to rates effective July 1 of each year. Effective July 1, 2020 there was an approximate 2% increase to this rate based on FERC's indexing adjustment. The initial term of the agreement is ten years with automatic one-year renewal terms with the option to cancel prior to each renewal period.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions.\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical accounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, equity method investments and revenue recognition. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\nLong-Lived Assets\nKey estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. Such estimates could be significantly modified. The carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and demand fundamentals of oil, natural gas, refinery gas or refined products (which could have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new technological developments, new competitors, adverse changes associated with the U.S. and global economies and with governmental actions. We evaluate long-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from five to 40 years. Depreciation of these assets under the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives totaled $50 million, $49 million and $46 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated, depreciation charges would be accelerated. Additional information concerning long-lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in Note 6 - Property, Plant and Equipment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe account for investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, under the equity method of accounting. Income from equity method investments represents our proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method investees. Differences in the basis of the investments and the separate net asset value of the investees, if any, are amortized into net income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, if the loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. When the loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is written down to fair value.\nBased on our updated forecast and expectations of market conditions, we determined that there was a triggering event as of December 7, 2020 for our Permian Basin equity method investment that required us to update our impairment evaluation. The updated forecast had reductions in forecasted volumes gathered and processed by Permian Basin. We utilized the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value appraisal of our investment in Permian Basin. Based on our evaluation, we determined that the fair value of our investment in Permian Basin was in excess of the carrying value as of December 7, 2020, and, therefore, there was no other-than-temporary impairment.\nThe fair value of the Permian Basin investment was determined based upon applying both the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach, and a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known and knowable information at the measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. If the discount rate was increased by 1%, the concluded fair value would decrease by $5 million and would remain in excess of carrying value. If the long-term growth rate was decreased by 1%, the concluded fair value would decrease by $4 million and would remain in excess of carrying value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related Accounting Standard Updates to this Topic (collectively, the revenue standard\u201d). See Note 12 - Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations. We generate a portion of our revenue under long-term agreements by charging fees for the transportation, terminaling and storage of crude oil and refined products, intermediate and finished products through our pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks, and for the transportation of refinery gas through our assets. Contract obligations are billed monthly. Transportation revenue is billed as services are rendered, and we accrue revenue based on nominations for that accounting month. We estimate this revenue based on contract data, regulatory information and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements, among other items. Additionally, we refer to our transportation services agreements and throughput and deficiency agreements as ship-or-pay\u201d contracts.\nAs a result of FERC regulations, revenues we collect may be subject to refund. We establish reserves for these potential refunds based on actual expected refund amounts on the specific facts and circumstances. We had no reserves for potential refunds as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nThe majority of our long-term transportation agreements and tariffs for crude oil transportation include PLA. PLA is an allowance for volume losses due to measurement differences set forth in crude oil transportation agreements. PLA is intended to assure proper measurement of the crude oil despite solids, water, evaporation and variable crude types that can cause mismeasurement. PLA provides additional revenue for us if product losses on our pipelines are within the allowed levels, and we are required to compensate our customers for any product losses that exceed the allowed levels. We take title to any excess loss allowance when product losses are within the allowed levels, and we sell that product several times per year at prevailing market prices.\nCertain transportation and terminaling services agreements with related parties are considered operating leases under GAAP. Revenues from these agreements are recorded within Lease revenue-related parties in the accompanying consolidated statement of income. See Note 12 - Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nApril 2020 Transaction Fair Value\nIn connection with the April 2020 Transaction, we utilized the services of independent valuation specialists to determine the fair value of the total consideration, as well as the fair values of the Mattox Transaction, the Norco Transaction, and the GP/IDR Restructuring as of April 1, 2020. Because the components of the April 2020 Transaction were entered in contemplation of each other and were transactions among entities under common control, the fair values of the April 2020 Transaction were used solely for the purpose of allocating a portion of the total consideration on a relative fair value basis to the Norco Transaction. The Partnership issued 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units and 160,000,000 newly issued common units to SPLC as consideration for the April 2020 Transaction. See Note 3 - Acquisitions and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional details.\nAs further described in Note 3 - Acquisitions and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we acquired the Mattox equity interests from SGOM as a part of the Mattox Transaction. The acquisition was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control on a prospective basis as an asset acquisition. As a part of the Norco Transaction, SOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex to Triton, as designee of the Partnership. The transfer of the Norco Assets combined with the terminaling service agreements was accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard, as control of the assets did not transfer to the Partnership. As a result, the transaction was treated as financing arrangement.\nWe also recorded contract assets as of April 1, 2020 based on the difference between the consideration allocated to the Norco Transaction and the recognized financing receivables. The contract assets represent the excess of the fair value embedded within the terminaling services agreements transferred by the Partnership to SOPUS and Shell Chemical as part of entering into the terminaling services agreements. The amount of contract assets recognized was dependent on the allocated fair value of the consideration to the Norco Transaction, which was determined using the fair values of the consideration transferred and the fair values of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction. The common units were valued using a market approach based on the market opening price of the Partnership's common units as of April 1, 2020 less a discount for the distribution waiver and lack of marketability. The Series A Preferred Units were valued using an income approach based on a trinomial lattice model. Further, the fair values of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction were determined using an income approach of discounted cash flows at an average discount rate for each of the Mattox Transaction, the Norco Transaction and the GP/IDR Restructuring components of 14%, 11% and 20%, respectively.\nWe believe both the estimates and assumptions utilized in the fair value appraisals of the April 2020 Transaction are individually and in the aggregate reasonable; however, our estimates and assumptions are highly judgmental in nature. Further, there are inherent uncertainties related to these estimates and assumptions, and our judgment in applying them, to determine the fair values. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values, changes in any one of the estimates, assumptions or a combination of estimates and assumptions, could result in changes to the estimated fair values utilized to determine the relative stand-alone fair value of the Norco Transaction.\nFair value of consideration\nThe following table summarized the fair valuation approaches and key assumptions underlying those approaches to value the different components of the consideration of the April 2020 Transaction:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Valuation Technique </td> <td> </td> <td>Key assumptions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common Units </td> <td> </td> <td>Market Approach </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount for lack of marketability; waiver discount </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series A Preferred Units </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Approach </td> <td> </td> <td>Volatility rate; expected term; yield and conversion price </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value of business enterprise value\nThe following table summarizes the fair valuation approaches and key assumptions underlying those approaches to obtain the business enterprise value of the different components of the April 2020 Transaction:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Valuation Technique </td> <td> </td> <td>Key assumptions </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mattox Transaction </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Approach </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rates; revenue growth rates; terminal growth rates; cash flow projections </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Norco Transaction </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Approach </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rates; revenue growth rates; terminal growth rates; cash flow projections </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GP/IDR Restructuring </td> <td> </td> <td>Income Approach </td> <td> </td> <td>Discount rates; revenue growth rates; terminal growth rates; projected CAFD </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRelative Stand -Alone Selling Price\nWe allocate the arrangement consideration between the components based on the relative stand-alone selling price ( SASP\u201d) of each component in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Partnership established the stand-alone selling price for the financing components based off an expected return on the assets being financed. The Partnership established the SASP for the service components using an expected cost-plus margin approach based on the Partnership's forecasted costs of satisfying the performance obligations plus an appropriate margin for the service. The SASP is used to allocate the annual terminaling service agreement payments between the principal payments and interest income on the financing receivables (financing components) and terminaling service revenue (service components). The key assumptions include forecasts of the future operation and maintenance costs and major maintenance costs and the expected margin with respect to the service components and the expected return on the assets with respect to the financing components.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease read Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of the company's financial condition and operations, including its ownership and operation of pipelines and midstream assets.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are the analysis of our financial performance, financial condition and significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. It should also be read together with Risk factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842, Leases ( the lease standard\u201d) by applying the modified retrospective approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 and balances at December 31, 2019 are presented in accordance with the lease standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under previous generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). See Note 9 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nPartnership Overview\nWe own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets and logistic assets. As of December 31, 2020, our assets include interests in entities that own (a) crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals that serve as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and deliver refined products from those markets to major demand centers and (b) storage tanks and financing receivables that are secured by pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and other infrastructure used to stage and transport intermediate and finished products. Our assets also include interests in entities that own natural gas and refinery gas pipelines that transport offshore natural gas to market hubs and deliver refinery gas from refineries and plants to chemical sites along the Gulf Coast.\nFor a description of our assets, please see Part I, Item 1 - Business and Properties of this report.\n2020 developments include:\n-Purchase and Sale Agreement. On April 1, 2020, we closed the following transactions (collectively referred to as the April 2020 Transaction\u201d) pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of February 27, 2020 (the Purchase and Sale Agreement\u201d) by and among the Partnership, Triton West LLC ( Triton\u201d), SPLC, Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC ( SGOM\u201d), Shell Chemical LP ( Shell Chemical\u201d) and Equilon Enterprises LLC d/b/a Shell Oil Products US ( SOPUS\u201d):\ni.We acquired 79% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Mattox Pipeline Company LLC from SGOM (the Mattox Transaction\u201d).\nii.SOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred to Triton, as a designee of the Partnership, certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex located in Norco, Louisiana, which are comprised of crude, chemicals, intermediate and finished product pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and supporting infrastructure (such assets, the Norco Assets\u201d and such transaction, the Norco Transaction\u201d).\n-Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement. On April 1, 2020, simultaneously with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we also closed the transactions contemplated by the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement with our general partner, dated as of February 27, 2020 (the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement\u201d), eliminating all incentive distribution rights ( IDRs\u201d) and converting the economic general partner interest in the Partnership into a non-economic general partner interest (the GP/IDR Restructuring\u201d). As consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement, SPLC received 160,000,000 newly issued common units, plus 50,782,904 Series A perpetual convertible preferred units (the Series A Preferred Units\u201d). Our general partner (or its assignee) has also agreed to waive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be payable on the common units issued to SPLC as part of the April 2020 Transaction, in an amount of $20 million per quarter for four consecutive fiscal quarters, beginning with the distribution made with respect to the second quarter of 2020.\nRefer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\nWe generate revenue from the transportation, terminaling and storage of crude oil, refined products, and intermediate and finished products through our pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks, generate income from our equity and other investments, and generate interest income from financing receivables on the Norco Assets. Our revenue is generated from customers in the same industry, our Parent's affiliates, integrated oil companies, marketers and independent exploration, production and refining companies primarily within the Gulf Coast region of the United States. We generally do not own any of the crude oil, refinery gas or refined petroleum products we handle, nor do we engage in the trading of these commodities. We\ntherefore have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term.\nNotable 2020 and certain anticipated 2021 impacts to net income and cash available for distribution ( CAFD\u201d) include:\n\u2022Hurricanes. As a result of several hurricanes, we incurred an impact of approximately $20 million to net income and CAFD in the latter half 2020. Certain producers in the Gulf of Mexico elected to shut-in and evacuate as a safety precaution, while others were forced to shut-in or curtail production due to onshore closures. Further, certain onshore assets were impacted by power outages related to the storms. There was no material impact to our people or assets as a result of the storms.\n\u2022Planned Turnarounds. Certain connected producers had planned turnarounds during 2020. As a result, the impact to net income and CAFD from this turnaround activity was approximately $15 million for the year ended 2020. Further, we anticipate an impact of approximately $10 million to net income and CAFD from planned turnaround activity in 2021.\nThe broader market environment for our customers was challenging in 2019 and continued to be challenging during 2020 given the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted worldwide demand for oil and gas and increased downward pressure on oil prices. The responses of oil and gas producers to the lower demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas are constantly evolving and remain uncertain. The master limited partnership ( MLP\u201d) market has also changed significantly, as capital for high growth fueled by dropdown activity continues to be constrained. We are fortunate to have the support of RDS, who has provided us favorable loan and equity terms, allowing us flexibility to acquire high quality assets from our affiliates. While we expect to retain this flexibility, we anticipate continuing to moderate inorganic growth in our asset base and focusing on the sustainable operation of our core assets, cash preservation and the organic growth of our business in 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nNet income was $556 million and net income attributable to the Partnership was $543 million in 2020. We generated cash from operations of $650 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $320 million, total debt of $2,692 million and unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities of $896 million.\nOur 2020 operations and strategic initiatives demonstrated our continuing focus on our business strategies:\n\u2022Maintain operational excellence through prioritization of safety, reliability and efficiency;\n\u2022Enhanced focus on cash optimization and reduced discretionary project spend;\n\u2022Focus on advantageous commercial agreements with creditworthy counterparties to enhance financial results and deliver reliable distribution growth over the long-term; and\n\u2022Optimize existing assets and pursue organic growth opportunities.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) revenue (including pipeline loss allowance ( PLA\u201d) from contracted capacity and throughput); (ii) operations and maintenance expenses (including capital expenses); (iii) Adjusted EBITDA (defined below); and (iv) CAFD.\nContracted Capacity and Throughput\nThe amount of revenue our assets generate primarily depends on our transportation and storage services agreements with shippers and the volumes of crude oil, refinery gas and refined products that we handle through our pipelines, terminals and storage tanks.\nThe commitments under our transportation, terminaling and storage services agreements with shippers and the volumes we handle in our pipelines and storage tanks are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, refinery gas, natural gas and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. This supply and demand is impacted by the market prices for these products in the markets we serve. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant disruptions in the U.S. economy and financial and energy markets, including substantial demand destruction in the oil and gas markets. Responses of oil and gas producers to the lower demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas are constantly evolving and unpredictable, but further or continued decreases in demand (including due to renewed economic shutdowns and restrictions in response to increased COVID-19 infection rates) could force producers to shut-in certain wellheads or otherwise cease or curtail their operations. It also could reduce the volumes running through our pipelines and terminals.\nWe utilize the commercial arrangements we believe are the most prudent under the market conditions to deliver on our business strategy. The results of our operations will be impacted by our ability to:\n\u2022maintain utilization of and rates charged for our pipelines and storage facilities;\n\u2022utilize the remaining uncommitted capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems;\n\u2022increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third-party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products; and\n\u2022identify and execute organic expansion projects.\nOperations and Maintenance Expenses\nOur operations and maintenance expenses consist primarily of:\n\u2022labor expenses (including contractor services);\n\u2022insurance costs (including coverage for our consolidated assets and operated joint ventures);\n\u2022utility costs (including electricity and fuel);\n\u2022repairs and maintenance expenses; and\n\u2022major maintenance costs (related to the terminaling service agreements of the Norco Assets, which are expensed as incurred because the Partnership does not own the related assets).\nCertain costs naturally fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle, whereas other costs generally remain stable across broad ranges of throughput and storage volumes, but can vary depending upon the level of both planned and unplanned maintenance activity in the particular period. Our maintenance activity can be impacted by events such as turnarounds, asset integrity work and storms.\nOur management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing operations and maintenance expenses. For example, our property and business interruption insurance is provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell, which results in cost savings and improved coverage. Further, we, along with our Parent, are currently undertaking an initiative to reduce operational costs. We expect that some of these activities, such as re-scoping and/or deferring projects, evaluating third-party service contracts and reducing the use of contractors, will directly benefit our assets and their contribution to our net income. Other activities, such as the streamlining of structure and processes at the Parent level, will result in a reduction of certain costs and fees for which we reimburse and pay SPLC. While cost effectiveness has always been a focus of the business, it is of increased importance given the current operating environment.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nAdjusted EBITDA and CAFD have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or CAFD in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Please refer to Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for the reconciliation of GAAP measures net income and cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, gain or loss from dispositions of fixed assets, allowance oil reduction to net realizable value, loss from revision of asset retirement obligation, and depreciation, amortization and accretion, plus cash distributed to us from equity method investments for the applicable period, less equity method distributions included in other income and income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parent.\nWe define CAFD as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid by the Partnership, cash reserves, income taxes paid and Series A Preferred Unit distributions, plus net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership, reimbursements from Parent included in partners' capital, principal and interest payments received on financing receivables and certain one-time payments received. CAFD will not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nThe definition of CAFD was updated for the second quarter of 2020 due to the closing of the April 2020 Transaction, which resulted in part in the transfer of the Norco Assets to be accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard. As a result, the Partnership recognized financing receivables from SOPUS and Shell Chemical. These assets impact CAFD since principal payments on the financing receivables are not included in net income. As a result, such principal and interest payments on the financing receivables have been included as an adjustment to CAFD since the second quarter of 2020. Also as partial consideration for the April 2020 Transaction, SPLC received 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units. The distributions on these Series A Preferred Units have been deducted from CAFD since the second quarter of 2020.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP supplemental financial measures provides useful information to management and investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA and CAFD are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n\u2022our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;\n\u2022the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;\n\u2022our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nFactors Affecting Our Business and Outlook\nWe believe key factors that impact our business are the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, refinery gas and refined products in the markets in which our business operates. We also believe that our customers' requirements, competition and government regulation of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and refinery gas play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies. In addition, acquisition opportunities, whether from Shell or third parties, and financing options, will also impact our business. These factors are discussed in more detail below.\nChanges in Crude Oil Sourcing and Refined Product Demand Dynamics\nTo effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil and refined products supply and demand. Changes in crude oil supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields, operational impacts at producer fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil supply affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. In addition, general economic, broad market and worldwide health considerations, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, can also affect sourcing and demand dynamics for our services.\nOne of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline systems is their ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply markets to key refining centers along the Gulf Coast. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. They also occasionally choose to store crude longer term when the forward price is higher than the current price (a contango market\u201d). While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported or stored are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our total crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics, including the demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as U.S. exports.\nSimilarly, our refined products pipelines have the ability to serve multiple major demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipelines, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our various pipelines, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products supply and demand dynamics, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand can also be greatly affected by refinery performance in the end market, as refined products pipeline demand will increase to fill the supply gap created by refinery issues.\nWe can also be constrained by asset integrity considerations in the volumes we ship. We may elect to reduce cycling on our systems to reduce asset integrity risk, which in turn would likely result in lower revenues.\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers and to create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements. For example, production from Shell's Appomattox platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which came online during 2019, tied into our existing Proteus and Endymion systems to bring crude onshore. Similarly, we expect to continue extending our corridor pipelines to provide developing growth regions in the Gulf of Mexico with access via our existing corridors to onshore refining centers and market hubs. By way of example, in the latter part of 2019 we announced a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the Mars system to address growing production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico regions served by Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022. We believe this strategy will allow our offshore business to grow profitably throughout demand cycles.\nChanges in Customer Contracting\nWe generate a portion of our revenue under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers, including ship-or-pay agreements and life-of-lease transportation agreements, some of which provide a guaranteed return, and storage service agreements with marketers, pipelines and refiners. Historically, the commercial terms of these long-term transportation and storage service agreements have substantially mitigated volatility in our financial results by limiting our direct exposure to reductions in volumes due to supply or demand variability. Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to renew or replace our contract portfolio on comparable terms, by sustained downturns or sluggishness in commodity prices, or the economy in general (as with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on the demand for oil and gas), and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our operations. Our business can also be impacted by asset integrity or customer interruptions and natural disasters or other events that could lead customers to invoke force majeure or other defenses to avoid contractual performance.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Zydeco recontracted previously expired volumes under certain of its throughput and deficiency agreements ( T&D agreements\u201d). Although we replaced the volumes, the rates under the new T&D agreements were lower than those previously contracted. Two of these T&D agreements expired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and have not been replaced. The T&D agreements that expired accounted for less than 10% of our revenue for 2020. There are several ways in which this revenue could be replaced in the future, such as through re-contracting or spot shipments, the outcome of which will be dependent on market and customer dynamics.\nThe market environment at any given time will dictate the rates, terms and duration of agreements that shippers are willing to enter into, as well as the contracts that best satisfy the needs of our business. As we have grown and diversified our business over the past several years, and as recently as the second quarter of 2020 with the April 2020 Transaction, we have benefited from shifting reliance away from the results of any one asset. While Zydeco continues to serve an important market, and we strive to maximize the long-term value of the system to both shippers and the pipeline, we will continue to diversify our risk across products, customers and geographies.\nChanges in Commodity Prices and Customers' Volumes\nCrude oil prices have fluctuated significantly over the past few years, often with drastic moves in relatively short periods of time. During 2020, the demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas decreased significantly due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental regulations and travel restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. The current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty continues to contribute to future volatility in financial and commodity markets. Our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the PLA provisions in our tariffs. Indirectly, global demand for refined products and chemicals could impact our terminal operations and refined products and refinery gas pipelines, as well as our crude pipelines that feed U.S. manufacturing demand. Likewise, changes in the global market for crude oil could affect our crude oil pipeline and terminals and require expansion capital expenditures to reach\ngrowing export hubs. Demand for crude oil, refined products and refinery gas may decline in the areas we serve as a result of decreased production by our customers, depressed commodity prices, decreased third-party investment in the industry, increased competition and other adverse economic factors such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, which affect the exploration, production and refining industries. Although we have seen the earlier depressed demand due to the pandemic for crude oil and refined products level off, further increases in COVID-19 infection rates could have additional negative impacts on demand. This could force producers to shut-in certain wellheads or otherwise cease or curtail their operations. It also could reduce the volumes running through our pipelines and terminals. However, fixed contracts with volume minimums and demand for tanks for storage are expected to moderate any impact on our terminaling and storage service revenue.\nCertain of our assets benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements and are strategically positioned to connect crude oil volumes originating from key onshore and offshore production basins to the Texas and Louisiana refining markets, where demand for throughput has remained strong. Historically, we have not experienced a material decline in throughput volumes on our crude oil pipeline systems as a result of lower crude oil prices. However, if crude oil prices remain at lower levels for a sustained period due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, we will continue to see a reduction in our transportation volumes if production coming into our systems is deferred and our associated allowance oil sales decrease. Our customers may also experience liquidity and credit problems or other unexpected events, which could cause them to defer development or repair projects, avoid our contracts in bankruptcy, invoke force majeure clauses or other defenses to avoid contractual performance or renegotiate our contracts on terms that are less attractive to us or impair their ability to perform under our contracts.\nOur throughput volumes on our refined products pipeline systems depend primarily on the volume of refined products produced at connected refineries and the desirability of our end markets. These factors in turn are driven by refining margins, maintenance schedules and market differentials. Refining margins depend on the cost of crude oil or other feedstocks and the price of refined products, which have decreased significantly during 2020. These margins are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for crude oil and refined products. Our refined products pipelines are continuing to experience demand destruction in the near term due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a significant decrease in consumer demand for refined products such as gasoline and jet fuel.\nOther Changes in Customers' Volumes\nOnshore crude transportation volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOffshore crude transportation volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to planned maintenance activities, storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico and delays to new wells or well work overs due to storm activity.\nOnshore terminaling and storage volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to lower volume throughput from our customers as a result of the demand destruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMajor Maintenance Projects\nAt the end of 2019, we finalized a directional drill project on the Zydeco pipeline system to address soil erosion over a two-mile section of our 22-inch diameter pipeline under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer in Louisiana (the directional drill project\u201d). Zydeco incurred approximately $42 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the total directional drill project. In connection with the acquisitions of additional interests in Zydeco, SPLC agreed to reimburse us against our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses with respect to this project. Costs incurred and reimbursed during 2020 were not material.\nDuring 2020, we incurred costs related to the Bessie Heights project ( Bessie Heights\u201d), which is a directional drill project on the Zydeco pipeline system to replace an exposed and suspended 22-inch diameter pipe in the low-lying marsh area between Bird Island and Bridge City, Texas, as well as to replace lap welded pipe below the Neches River. Zydeco incurred approximately $13 million in maintenance capital expenditures in 2020 to complete the project. Any remaining spend in the first quarter of 2021 is not expected to be material.\nFor expected capital expenditures in 2020, refer to Capital Resources and Liquidity - Capital Expenditures and Investments.\nMajor Expansion Projects\nOn Mars, we announced in the latter part of 2019 a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the system. Letters of intent are in place, and we are now progressing definitive agreements with producers and expect to complete them by the end of the first quarter of 2021. SPLC has elected to fund the installation of the equipment necessary to enable greater throughput\nvolumes on the system, but the revenue associated with increased throughput volumes will benefit Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022.\nCustomers\nWe transport and store crude oil, refined products, natural gas and refinery gas for a broad mix of customers, including producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and are connected to other crude oil and refined products pipelines. In addition to serving directly-connected U.S. Gulf Coast markets, our crude oil and refined products pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation and storage services for a variety of reasons. Refiners typically require a secure and reliable supply of crude oil over a prolonged period of time to meet the needs of their specified refining diet and frequently enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure a ready supply of crude oil, rate surety and sometimes sufficient transportation capacity over the life of the contract. Similarly, chemical sites require a secure and reliable supply of refinery gas to crackers and enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure steady supply. Producers of crude oil and natural gas require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greater market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil and refined products to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil and refined products supply and demand dynamics in our markets. Refer to Note 14 - Transactions with Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.\nCompetition\nOur pipeline systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and with marine and rail transportation. Some of our competitors may expand or construct transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. For example, newly constructed transportation systems in the onshore Gulf of Mexico region may increase competition in the markets where our pipelines operate. In addition, future pipeline transportation capacity could be constructed in excess of actual demand in the market areas we serve, which could reduce the demand for our services, and could lead to the reduction of the rates that we receive for our services. While we do see some variation from quarter-to quarter resulting from changes in our customers' demand for transportation, this risk has historically been mitigated by the long-term, fixed rate basis upon which we have contracted a substantial portion of our capacity.\nOur storage terminal competes with surrounding providers of storage tank services. Some of our competitors have expanded terminals and built new pipeline connections, and third parties may construct pipelines that bypass our location. These, or similar events, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur refined products terminals generally compete with other terminals", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are the analysis of our financial performance, financial condition and significant trends that may affect future performance. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. It should also be read together with Risk factors\u201d and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this report.\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 842, Leases ( the lease standard\u201d) by applying the modified retrospective approach. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 and balances at December 31, 2019 are presented in accordance with the lease standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under previous generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). See Note 9 - Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.\nPartnership Overview\nWe own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets and logistic assets. As of December 31, 2020, our assets include interests in entities that own (a) crude oil and refined products pipelines and terminals that serve as key infrastructure to transport onshore and offshore crude oil production to Gulf Coast and Midwest refining markets and deliver refined products from those markets to major demand centers and (b) storage tanks and financing receivables that are secured by pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and other infrastructure used to stage and transport intermediate and finished products. Our assets also include interests in entities that own natural gas and refinery gas pipelines that transport offshore natural gas to market hubs and deliver refinery gas from refineries and plants to chemical sites along the Gulf Coast.\nFor a description of our assets, please see Part I, Item 1 - Business and Properties of this report.\n2020 developments include:\n-Purchase and Sale Agreement. On April 1, 2020, we closed the following transactions (collectively referred to as the April 2020 Transaction\u201d) pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated as of February 27, 2020 (the Purchase and Sale Agreement\u201d) by and among the Partnership, Triton West LLC ( Triton\u201d), SPLC, Shell GOM Pipeline Company LLC ( SGOM\u201d), Shell Chemical LP ( Shell Chemical\u201d) and Equilon Enterprises LLC d/b/a Shell Oil Products US ( SOPUS\u201d):\ni.We acquired 79% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Mattox Pipeline Company LLC from SGOM (the Mattox Transaction\u201d).\nii.SOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred to Triton, as a designee of the Partnership, certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex located in Norco, Louisiana, which are comprised of crude, chemicals, intermediate and finished product pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and supporting infrastructure (such assets, the Norco Assets\u201d and such transaction, the Norco Transaction\u201d).\n-Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement. On April 1, 2020, simultaneously with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement, we also closed the transactions contemplated by the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement with our general partner, dated as of February 27, 2020 (the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement\u201d), eliminating all incentive distribution rights ( IDRs\u201d) and converting the economic general partner interest in the Partnership into a non-economic general partner interest (the GP/IDR Restructuring\u201d). As consideration for the transactions contemplated by the Purchase and Sale Agreement and the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement, SPLC received 160,000,000 newly issued common units, plus 50,782,904 Series A perpetual convertible preferred units (the Series A Preferred Units\u201d). Our general partner (or its assignee) has also agreed to waive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be payable on the common units issued to SPLC as part of the April 2020 Transaction, in an amount of $20 million per quarter for four consecutive fiscal quarters, beginning with the distribution made with respect to the second quarter of 2020.\nRefer to Note 3 - Acquisitions and Other Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for more details.\nWe generate revenue from the transportation, terminaling and storage of crude oil, refined products, and intermediate and finished products through our pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks, generate income from our equity and other investments, and generate interest income from financing receivables on the Norco Assets. Our revenue is generated from customers in the same industry, our Parent's affiliates, integrated oil companies, marketers and independent exploration, production and refining companies primarily within the Gulf Coast region of the United States. We generally do not own any of the crude oil, refinery gas or refined petroleum products we handle, nor do we engage in the trading of these commodities. We\ntherefore have limited direct exposure to risks associated with fluctuating commodity prices, although these risks indirectly influence our activities and results of operations over the long-term.\nNotable 2020 and certain anticipated 2021 impacts to net income and cash available for distribution ( CAFD\u201d) include:\n\u2022Hurricanes. As a result of several hurricanes, we incurred an impact of approximately $20 million to net income and CAFD in the latter half 2020. Certain producers in the Gulf of Mexico elected to shut-in and evacuate as a safety precaution, while others were forced to shut-in or curtail production due to onshore closures. Further, certain onshore assets were impacted by power outages related to the storms. There was no material impact to our people or assets as a result of the storms.\n\u2022Planned Turnarounds. Certain connected producers had planned turnarounds during 2020. As a result, the impact to net income and CAFD from this turnaround activity was approximately $15 million for the year ended 2020. Further, we anticipate an impact of approximately $10 million to net income and CAFD from planned turnaround activity in 2021.\nThe broader market environment for our customers was challenging in 2019 and continued to be challenging during 2020 given the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted worldwide demand for oil and gas and increased downward pressure on oil prices. The responses of oil and gas producers to the lower demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas are constantly evolving and remain uncertain. The master limited partnership ( MLP\u201d) market has also changed significantly, as capital for high growth fueled by dropdown activity continues to be constrained. We are fortunate to have the support of RDS, who has provided us favorable loan and equity terms, allowing us flexibility to acquire high quality assets from our affiliates. While we expect to retain this flexibility, we anticipate continuing to moderate inorganic growth in our asset base and focusing on the sustainable operation of our core assets, cash preservation and the organic growth of our business in 2021.\nExecutive Overview\nNet income was $556 million and net income attributable to the Partnership was $543 million in 2020. We generated cash from operations of $650 million. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $320 million, total debt of $2,692 million and unused capacity under our revolving credit facilities of $896 million.\nOur 2020 operations and strategic initiatives demonstrated our continuing focus on our business strategies:\n\u2022Maintain operational excellence through prioritization of safety, reliability and efficiency;\n\u2022Enhanced focus on cash optimization and reduced discretionary project spend;\n\u2022Focus on advantageous commercial agreements with creditworthy counterparties to enhance financial results and deliver reliable distribution growth over the long-term; and\n\u2022Optimize existing assets and pursue organic growth opportunities.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nOur management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze our performance. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include: (i) revenue (including pipeline loss allowance ( PLA\u201d) from contracted capacity and throughput); (ii) operations and maintenance expenses (including capital expenses); (iii) Adjusted EBITDA (defined below); and (iv) CAFD.\nContracted Capacity and Throughput\nThe amount of revenue our assets generate primarily depends on our transportation and storage services agreements with shippers and the volumes of crude oil, refinery gas and refined products that we handle through our pipelines, terminals and storage tanks.\nThe commitments under our transportation, terminaling and storage services agreements with shippers and the volumes we handle in our pipelines and storage tanks are primarily affected by the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, refinery gas, natural gas and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. This supply and demand is impacted by the market prices for these products in the markets we serve. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause significant disruptions in the U.S. economy and financial and energy markets, including substantial demand destruction in the oil and gas markets. Responses of oil and gas producers to the lower demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas are constantly evolving and unpredictable, but further or continued decreases in demand (including due to renewed economic shutdowns and restrictions in response to increased COVID-19 infection rates) could force producers to shut-in certain wellheads or otherwise cease or curtail their operations. It also could reduce the volumes running through our pipelines and terminals.\nWe utilize the commercial arrangements we believe are the most prudent under the market conditions to deliver on our business strategy. The results of our operations will be impacted by our ability to:\n\u2022maintain utilization of and rates charged for our pipelines and storage facilities;\n\u2022utilize the remaining uncommitted capacity on, or add additional capacity to, our pipeline systems;\n\u2022increase throughput volumes on our pipeline systems by making connections to existing or new third-party pipelines or other facilities, primarily driven by the anticipated supply of, and demand for, crude oil and refined products; and\n\u2022identify and execute organic expansion projects.\nOperations and Maintenance Expenses\nOur operations and maintenance expenses consist primarily of:\n\u2022labor expenses (including contractor services);\n\u2022insurance costs (including coverage for our consolidated assets and operated joint ventures);\n\u2022utility costs (including electricity and fuel);\n\u2022repairs and maintenance expenses; and\n\u2022major maintenance costs (related to the terminaling service agreements of the Norco Assets, which are expensed as incurred because the Partnership does not own the related assets).\nCertain costs naturally fluctuate based on throughput volumes and the grades of crude oil and types of refined products we handle, whereas other costs generally remain stable across broad ranges of throughput and storage volumes, but can vary depending upon the level of both planned and unplanned maintenance activity in the particular period. Our maintenance activity can be impacted by events such as turnarounds, asset integrity work and storms.\nOur management seeks to maximize our profitability by effectively managing operations and maintenance expenses. For example, our property and business interruption insurance is provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell, which results in cost savings and improved coverage. Further, we, along with our Parent, are currently undertaking an initiative to reduce operational costs. We expect that some of these activities, such as re-scoping and/or deferring projects, evaluating third-party service contracts and reducing the use of contractors, will directly benefit our assets and their contribution to our net income. Other activities, such as the streamlining of structure and processes at the Parent level, will result in a reduction of certain costs and fees for which we reimburse and pay SPLC. While cost effectiveness has always been a focus of the business, it is of increased importance given the current operating environment.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Cash Available for Distribution\nAdjusted EBITDA and CAFD have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or CAFD in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities. Please refer to Results of Operations - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for the reconciliation of GAAP measures net income and cash provided by operating activities to non-GAAP measures Adjusted EBITDA and CAFD.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, gain or loss from dispositions of fixed assets, allowance oil reduction to net realizable value, loss from revision of asset retirement obligation, and depreciation, amortization and accretion, plus cash distributed to us from equity method investments for the applicable period, less equity method distributions included in other income and income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests and Adjusted EBITDA attributable to Parent.\nWe define CAFD as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid by the Partnership, cash reserves, income taxes paid and Series A Preferred Unit distributions, plus net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership, reimbursements from Parent included in partners' capital, principal and interest payments received on financing receivables and certain one-time payments received. CAFD will not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nThe definition of CAFD was updated for the second quarter of 2020 due to the closing of the April 2020 Transaction, which resulted in part in the transfer of the Norco Assets to be accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard. As a result, the Partnership recognized financing receivables from SOPUS and Shell Chemical. These assets impact CAFD since principal payments on the financing receivables are not included in net income. As a result, such principal and interest payments on the financing receivables have been included as an adjustment to CAFD since the second quarter of 2020. Also as partial consideration for the April 2020 Transaction, SPLC received 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units. The distributions on these Series A Preferred Units have been deducted from CAFD since the second quarter of 2020.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP supplemental financial measures provides useful information to management and investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA and CAFD are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\n\u2022our operating performance as compared to other publicly-traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods;\n\u2022the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders;\n\u2022our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and\n\u2022the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nFactors Affecting Our Business and Outlook\nWe believe key factors that impact our business are the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, refinery gas and refined products in the markets in which our business operates. We also believe that our customers' requirements, competition and government regulation of crude oil, refined products, natural gas and refinery gas play an important role in how we manage our operations and implement our long-term strategies. In addition, acquisition opportunities, whether from Shell or third parties, and financing options, will also impact our business. These factors are discussed in more detail below.\nChanges in Crude Oil Sourcing and Refined Product Demand Dynamics\nTo effectively manage our business, we monitor our market areas for both short-term and long-term shifts in crude oil and refined products supply and demand. Changes in crude oil supply such as new discoveries of reserves, declining production in older fields, operational impacts at producer fields and the introduction of new sources of crude oil supply affect the demand for our services from both producers and consumers. In addition, general economic, broad market and worldwide health considerations, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, can also affect sourcing and demand dynamics for our services.\nOne of the strategic advantages of our crude oil pipeline systems is their ability to transport attractively priced crude oil from multiple supply markets to key refining centers along the Gulf Coast. Our crude oil shippers periodically change the relative mix of crude oil grades delivered to the refineries and markets served by our pipelines. They also occasionally choose to store crude longer term when the forward price is higher than the current price (a contango market\u201d). While these changes in the sourcing patterns of crude oil transported or stored are reflected in changes in the relative volumes of crude oil by type handled by our pipelines, our total crude oil transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall crude oil supply and demand dynamics, including the demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as U.S. exports.\nSimilarly, our refined products pipelines have the ability to serve multiple major demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipelines, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our various pipelines, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products supply and demand dynamics, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand can also be greatly affected by refinery performance in the end market, as refined products pipeline demand will increase to fill the supply gap created by refinery issues.\nWe can also be constrained by asset integrity considerations in the volumes we ship. We may elect to reduce cycling on our systems to reduce asset integrity risk, which in turn would likely result in lower revenues.\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers and to create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements. For example, production from Shell's Appomattox platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which came online during 2019, tied into our existing Proteus and Endymion systems to bring crude onshore. Similarly, we expect to continue extending our corridor pipelines to provide developing growth regions in the Gulf of Mexico with access via our existing corridors to onshore refining centers and market hubs. By way of example, in the latter part of 2019 we announced a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the Mars system to address growing production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico regions served by Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022. We believe this strategy will allow our offshore business to grow profitably throughout demand cycles.\nChanges in Customer Contracting\nWe generate a portion of our revenue under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers, including ship-or-pay agreements and life-of-lease transportation agreements, some of which provide a guaranteed return, and storage service agreements with marketers, pipelines and refiners. Historically, the commercial terms of these long-term transportation and storage service agreements have substantially mitigated volatility in our financial results by limiting our direct exposure to reductions in volumes due to supply or demand variability. Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to renew or replace our contract portfolio on comparable terms, by sustained downturns or sluggishness in commodity prices, or the economy in general (as with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on the demand for oil and gas), and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our operations. Our business can also be impacted by asset integrity or customer interruptions and natural disasters or other events that could lead customers to invoke force majeure or other defenses to avoid contractual performance.\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Zydeco recontracted previously expired volumes under certain of its throughput and deficiency agreements ( T&D agreements\u201d). Although we replaced the volumes, the rates under the new T&D agreements were lower than those previously contracted. Two of these T&D agreements expired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and have not been replaced. The T&D agreements that expired accounted for less than 10% of our revenue for 2020. There are several ways in which this revenue could be replaced in the future, such as through re-contracting or spot shipments, the outcome of which will be dependent on market and customer dynamics.\nThe market environment at any given time will dictate the rates, terms and duration of agreements that shippers are willing to enter into, as well as the contracts that best satisfy the needs of our business. As we have grown and diversified our business over the past several years, and as recently as the second quarter of 2020 with the April 2020 Transaction, we have benefited from shifting reliance away from the results of any one asset. While Zydeco continues to serve an important market, and we strive to maximize the long-term value of the system to both shippers and the pipeline, we will continue to diversify our risk across products, customers and geographies.\nChanges in Commodity Prices and Customers' Volumes\nCrude oil prices have fluctuated significantly over the past few years, often with drastic moves in relatively short periods of time. During 2020, the demand for, and price of, oil and natural gas decreased significantly due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental regulations and travel restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. The current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty continues to contribute to future volatility in financial and commodity markets. Our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the PLA provisions in our tariffs. Indirectly, global demand for refined products and chemicals could impact our terminal operations and refined products and refinery gas pipelines, as well as our crude pipelines that feed U.S. manufacturing demand. Likewise, changes in the global market for crude oil could affect our crude oil pipeline and terminals and require expansion capital expenditures to reach\ngrowing export hubs. Demand for crude oil, refined products and refinery gas may decline in the areas we serve as a result of decreased production by our customers, depressed commodity prices, decreased third-party investment in the industry, increased competition and other adverse economic factors such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, which affect the exploration, production and refining industries. Although we have seen the earlier depressed demand due to the pandemic for crude oil and refined products level off, further increases in COVID-19 infection rates could have additional negative impacts on demand. This could force producers to shut-in certain wellheads or otherwise cease or curtail their operations. It also could reduce the volumes running through our pipelines and terminals. However, fixed contracts with volume minimums and demand for tanks for storage are expected to moderate any impact on our terminaling and storage service revenue.\nCertain of our assets benefit from long-term fee-based arrangements and are strategically positioned to connect crude oil volumes originating from key onshore and offshore production basins to the Texas and Louisiana refining markets, where demand for throughput has remained strong. Historically, we have not experienced a material decline in throughput volumes on our crude oil pipeline systems as a result of lower crude oil prices. However, if crude oil prices remain at lower levels for a sustained period due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, we will continue to see a reduction in our transportation volumes if production coming into our systems is deferred and our associated allowance oil sales decrease. Our customers may also experience liquidity and credit problems or other unexpected events, which could cause them to defer development or repair projects, avoid our contracts in bankruptcy, invoke force majeure clauses or other defenses to avoid contractual performance or renegotiate our contracts on terms that are less attractive to us or impair their ability to perform under our contracts.\nOur throughput volumes on our refined products pipeline systems depend primarily on the volume of refined products produced at connected refineries and the desirability of our end markets. These factors in turn are driven by refining margins, maintenance schedules and market differentials. Refining margins depend on the cost of crude oil or other feedstocks and the price of refined products, which have decreased significantly during 2020. These margins are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the domestic and global supply of and demand for crude oil and refined products. Our refined products pipelines are continuing to experience demand destruction in the near term due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a significant decrease in consumer demand for refined products such as gasoline and jet fuel.\nOther Changes in Customers' Volumes\nOnshore crude transportation volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to demand destruction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOffshore crude transportation volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to planned maintenance activities, storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico and delays to new wells or well work overs due to storm activity.\nOnshore terminaling and storage volumes were down in 2020 versus 2019 due to lower volume throughput from our customers as a result of the demand destruction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMajor Maintenance Projects\nAt the end of 2019, we finalized a directional drill project on the Zydeco pipeline system to address soil erosion over a two-mile section of our 22-inch diameter pipeline under the Atchafalaya River and Bayou Shaffer in Louisiana (the directional drill project\u201d). Zydeco incurred approximately $42 million in maintenance capital expenditures for the total directional drill project. In connection with the acquisitions of additional interests in Zydeco, SPLC agreed to reimburse us against our proportionate share of certain costs and expenses with respect to this project. Costs incurred and reimbursed during 2020 were not material.\nDuring 2020, we incurred costs related to the Bessie Heights project ( Bessie Heights\u201d), which is a directional drill project on the Zydeco pipeline system to replace an exposed and suspended 22-inch diameter pipe in the low-lying marsh area between Bird Island and Bridge City, Texas, as well as to replace lap welded pipe below the Neches River. Zydeco incurred approximately $13 million in maintenance capital expenditures in 2020 to complete the project. Any remaining spend in the first quarter of 2021 is not expected to be material.\nFor expected capital expenditures in 2020, refer to Capital Resources and Liquidity - Capital Expenditures and Investments.\nMajor Expansion Projects\nOn Mars, we announced in the latter part of 2019 a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the system. Letters of intent are in place, and we are now progressing definitive agreements with producers and expect to complete them by the end of the first quarter of 2021. SPLC has elected to fund the installation of the equipment necessary to enable greater throughput\nvolumes on the system, but the revenue associated with increased throughput volumes will benefit Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022.\nCustomers\nWe transport and store crude oil, refined products, natural gas and refinery gas for a broad mix of customers, including producers, refiners, marketers and traders, and are connected to other crude oil and refined products pipelines. In addition to serving directly-connected U.S. Gulf Coast markets, our crude oil and refined products pipelines have access to customers in various regions of the United States through interconnections with other major pipelines. Our customers use our transportation and storage services for a variety of reasons. Refiners typically require a secure and reliable supply of crude oil over a prolonged period of time to meet the needs of their specified refining diet and frequently enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure a ready supply of crude oil, rate surety and sometimes sufficient transportation capacity over the life of the contract. Similarly, chemical sites require a secure and reliable supply of refinery gas to crackers and enter into long-term firm transportation agreements to ensure steady supply. Producers of crude oil and natural gas require the ability to deliver their product to market and frequently enter into firm transportation contracts to ensure that they will have sufficient capacity available to deliver their product to delivery points with greater market liquidity. Marketers and traders generate income from buying and selling crude oil and refined products to capitalize on price differentials over time or between markets. Our customer mix can vary over time and largely depends on the crude oil and refined products supply and demand dynamics in our markets. Refer to Note 14 - Transactions with Major Customers and Concentration of Credit Risk in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for additional information.\nCompetition\nOur pipeline systems compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and with marine and rail transportation. Some of our competitors may expand or construct transportation systems that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. For example, newly constructed transportation systems in the onshore Gulf of Mexico region may increase competition in the markets where our pipelines operate. In addition, future pipeline transportation capacity could be constructed in excess of actual demand in the market areas we serve, which could reduce the demand for our services, and could lead to the reduction of the rates that we receive for our services. While we do see some variation from quarter-to quarter resulting from changes in our customers' demand for transportation, this risk has historically been mitigated by the long-term, fixed rate basis upon which we have contracted a substantial portion of our capacity.\nOur storage terminal competes with surrounding providers of storage tank services. Some of our competitors have expanded terminals and built new pipeline connections, and third parties may construct pipelines that bypass our location. These, or similar events, could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur refined products terminals generally compete with other terminals"}
