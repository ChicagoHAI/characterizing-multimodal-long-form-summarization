MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPending Transaction\nOn February 11, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with EM Eagle Purchaser, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Parent\u201d), and EM Eagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for our acquisition by private equity investment firm Thoma Bravo, LLC in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.7 billion (the Transaction\u201d). If the Transaction is completed, our stockholders will be entitled to receive $99.00 in cash for each share of our common stock they hold as of the effective time of the Transaction. The Transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2019, subject to approval by our stockholders and regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. See Note 14 Subsequent Event\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements for further details.\nOverview\nWe are the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry. Our technology solutions are used by lenders to originate and close residential mortgage loans. Banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders use our Encompass\u00ae all-in-one mortgage management solution to originate and fund mortgages and improve compliance, loan quality, and efficiency.\nMortgage originators use our Encompass software, a comprehensive digital mortgage solution that handles key business and management functions involved in running a residential mortgage origination business. Mortgage originators use Encompass as a single tool for marketing, loan origination, processing, and customer communication, and to interact electronically with lenders, investors, and service providers over the Ellie Mae Network. Our software also enables enforcement of rules and business practices designed to ensure loan quality, adherence to processing standards, and regulatory compliance.\nThe Ellie Mae Network electronically connects approximately 186,500 mortgage professionals using Encompass to the broad array of third-party service providers, mortgage lenders, and investors integral to the origination and funding of residential mortgages. During the mortgage origination process, mortgage originators may order various services through the Ellie Mae Network, including credit reports, product eligibility and pricing services, automated underwriting services, appraisals, title reports, insurance, flood certifications and flood insurance, compliance reviews, fraud detection, document preparation, and verification of income, identity, and employment. Mortgage originators can also initiate secure data transmission to and from lenders and investors.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method and applied Topic 606 to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and are reported under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nOur revenues are generated primarily from subscriptions to the cloud-based Encompass platform, including customers who pay fees based on the number of loans they close, subject to base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, or recurring monthly subscription fees and related professional services such as consulting, implementation, and training services. Our revenues also include software-related services that are sold on a transactional basis; Ellie Mae Network fees; fees for education and training; and loan product, policy and guideline data and analytics services.\nSeasonality and Current Industry Trends\nOur revenues generally follow the seasonality of the residential mortgage industry, with increased activity in the second and third quarters and reduced activity in the first and fourth quarters as home buyers tend to purchase their homes during the spring and summer. Mortgage volumes are also impacted by other factors such as interest rate fluctuations, home sale activity and pricing, regulatory changes, and general economic conditions, which can lead to departures from the typical seasonal pattern. A combination of tight housing inventory and rising mortgage interest rates resulted in a decline in mortgage volumes in 2018 relative to 2017. Although the market for mortgages is expected to transition to one in which increasing volumes are driven primarily by demand for home purchases, a tight housing supply in certain markets is currently limiting the rate of growth in purchase volumes.\nWe currently estimate that approximately 25% to 35% of our revenues have some direct sensitivity to volume. The base fee portion of success-based revenues, subscription revenues, and professional services revenues are generally not affected by fluctuations in mortgage origination volume. The impact on our revenues from a substantial decline in mortgage volumes is difficult to predict and subject to risk and uncertainty. Refer to the risks relating to a decline in mortgage lending volumes described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nOur Investments\nWe are investing aggressively in initiatives that we believe will help us continue to grow our business, improve our products and services, and strengthen our competitive advantage while bringing sustainable long-term value to our customers. Our recent launch of Encompass Developer Connect, Encompass Data Connect, and Encompass Investor Connect will enable developers to create new features for Encompass, easily integrate Encompass with external systems and data, and build and deploy custom applications in the cloud. In addition, lenders are also looking for a technology partner to deliver a better digital mortgage experience to consumers. We recently made generally available Encompass Consumer Connect, which enables our customers to originate loans directly from borrowers by offering an online loan application that can be accessed by anyone with a web browser. Furthermore, our acquisition of Velocify accelerates our vision of offering a fully digital mortgage by combining Velocify's lead management, engagement, and distribution capabilities with Encompass Consumer Connect.\nIn 2017 and 2018, we increased our investment in research and development, technology infrastructure, and data security to support our growing user base. This includes the roll out of our Connect solutions, the development of our hybrid cloud infrastructure, the additions and updates to loan applications required by the redesigned URLA, and the development of our next generation Encompass platform and capabilities, which we expect to continue to progressively roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020.\nWe have also invested in our sales and client services capabilities to continue to increase sales of our products and to assist our customers in implementing our solutions. To continue to support customers as we grow our business and further differentiate ourselves, we intend to invest in key areas, such as research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, data security, and our hybrid cloud infrastructure. We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase as we make additional and accelerated investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and data security, and as we place new internal-use software into service.\nIn addition to our internal initiatives, our business strategy has evolved in response to recent industry trends as follows:\nGreater focus on operational efficiencies. The average total production cost per loan was $8,174 in the third quarter of 2018(1). We expect operational costs to continue to be a significant consideration for mortgage originators due to the continuously changing regulatory environment and heightened quality standards. By automating many of the functions of mortgage origination, we enable our users to comply with regulations and process quality loans more efficiently and effectively. This reduces the cost of originating loans and lowers the risk of buy-back demands from investors resulting from poorly originated or documented loans or loans that fail to comply with applicable regulations. We continually address the changing needs of our customers by developing and enhancing tools to allow for simplified regulatory compliance, increased availability of information, and enhanced system functionality and performance.\nWith an eye towards providing customers with ever-improving tools to enhance efficiency, we currently anticipate that we will continue to develop new service offerings through the Ellie Mae Network and encourage adoption of our services through initiatives such as our Encompass Connect Solutions. By integrating and expanding our current and new services, we aim to provide a more comprehensive solution to our users.\nCustomers adopting multi-channel strategies. Customers are developing multi-channel strategies beyond a single retail, correspondent, or wholesale mortgage lending channel in order to grow their businesses. The requirements of these different channels vary, and in order to maintain a single operating system, customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality. Encompass includes support for multi-channel workflows, allowing our customers to drive efficiencies and boost productivity by creating distinct workflows for each channel that map to our customers' business needs. Encompass users can customize workflows based on channel, loan purpose or specific loan criteria - all of which can vary between lending channels. With the introduction of Encompass TPO Connect, Encompass users are able to utilize a customizable and interactive web experience for wholesale and correspondent lending channels, which gives lenders and investors a modern and collaborative web experience for their TPO partners that promotes compliance, data integrity, and easy bi-directional communication throughout the entire loan process. Additionally, Encompass Consumer Connect supports our customers' retail channel by enabling our customers to originate loans directly from borrowers by offering an online loan application that can be accessed by anyone with a web browser.\nChanges in regulation affecting lenders and investors. Mortgage lending regulations continue to change and many regulatory reforms have been introduced or proposed in recent years to promote increased underwriting standards and accountability by lenders and mortgage originators, ensure meaningful disclosures by lenders to borrowers, increase the transparency and objectivity of settlement services, and protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abusive lending practices. We devote considerable resources to continually upgrade our software to help our customers address regulatory changes. We offer Encompass Compliance Service, which analyzes mortgage loan data for compliance with consumer protection laws and institutionally mandated compliance policies and also alerts users to possible violations of these laws and policies. In addition, we have a staff of attorneys who work with compliance experts and help ensure that documents prepared using our software and the processes recommended by the Encompass workflow comply with applicable rules and regulations. For example, additional tools and product updates were required to address the Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage and Federal and State High Cost rules that became effective in January 2014. In addition, we updated certain of our products to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule changes that took effect in October 2015, and are providing complete offering of readiness initiatives, tools and training programs in advance of the 2018 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C collection and reporting changes which take effect through 2020. We are also making substantial changes to our products and services to accommodate the upcoming February 2020 adoption deadline for the redesigned Uniform Residential Loan Application. We believe we are well-positioned to help our customers comply with changing regulatory requirements as they are published and become effective. However, changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the residential mortgage industry could require us to incur significant costs to update our products and services so that our customers remain compliant with such laws and regulations.\nConsumer Demand for a Digital Based Experience from Lenders. Today's borrowers expect transparency, service and speed, and a human touch. To meet these requirements, lenders must offer a seamless, online experience that continues even after the application has been submitted. It is our goal to provide a true digital mortgage process that enables the lender to originate more loans, lower origination costs, reduce the time to close and make smarter decisions through data and predictive analytics, all while ensuring the highest levels of compliance, quality and efficiency. Our digital mortgage vision encompasses all phases of the mortgage loan lifecycle, with each milestone in the mortgage origination process informing the next.\nIncreased quality standards imposed by regulators, lenders, and investors. Lenders have eliminated many high-risk loan product offerings and significantly tightened underwriting and processing requirements. Similarly, investors seek higher-quality, lower-risk loans in which to invest. Encompass is designed to automate and streamline the process of originating mortgages to, among other things, satisfy increased quality requirements of investors. Relevant features of Encompass include enabling customers' management to impose processing rules and formats, and providing milestone and process reminders, automated population of forms with accurate data, and accurate and automated transmission of loan files and data from originators to investors and lenders.\nIn response to the increased quality standards and compliance mandates affecting the industry, we expect many non-Encompass mortgage lenders to assess new platform options and replace their legacy systems. We have increased the size of our customer acquisition, implementation, and support teams in order to address anticipated demand for our software solutions.\nGreater focus by customers and regulators on data security and consumer privacy. Recent high-profile data security incidents affecting banking institutions and their third-party service providers have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our customers and our customers' regulators. We are making significant investments in the security of the Encompass service, as well as our internal systems, processes, and monitoring capabilities to protect our customers' data and help minimize the risk of data security loss. We expect the industry focus on data security to continue to increase, and we anticipate that our investments in data security will increase substantially over time.\n________________\n(1) Mortgage Bankers Association, IBM Profits Lag in the Third Quarter, November 29, 2018.\nIncrease the number of lenders using Encompass and the number of loans originated on our platform. In addition to addressing the industry trends discussed above, we continue to focus our marketing, sales and product development efforts on increasing the number of mortgage lenders, commercial banks and credit unions using Encompass and our additional services, and the number of loans originated on our platform. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on all market segments, including the largest, or enterprise segment, of the lending industry.\nOperating Metrics\nWe use certain operational metrics to evaluate our business, determine allocation of our resources, and make decisions regarding corporate strategy. We focus on these metrics to determine our success in leveraging our user base to increase our revenues and to gauge the degree of our market penetration.\nOur key operating metrics are defined below.\nContracted revenues. Contracted revenues are those revenues that are fixed by the terms of a contract and are generally not affected by fluctuations in mortgage origination volume. These revenues consist of the base fee portion of Success-Based Pricing revenues, monthly per-user subscription revenues, professional services revenues, and subscription revenues paid for products other than Encompass.\nActive users. An active user is a mortgage origination professional who has used Encompass at least once within a 90-day period preceding the measurement date. A user is a mortgage origination professional working at an Encompass mortgage lender, such as a mortgage bank, commercial bank, thrift or credit union, which sources and funds loans and generally sells these funded loans to investors; or a mortgage brokerage, which typically processes and submits loan files to a mortgage lender or mega lender that funds the loan.\nAverage active users. Average active users during a period is calculated by averaging the monthly active users during a reporting period.\nEstimated Encompass closed loans. Estimated Encompass closed loans is an estimate of the number of loans originated by Encompass users, calculated as loans originated by our Success-Based Pricing customers, which does not include certain brokered loans or correspondent purchased loans, plus an estimate of the number of loans originated by Encompass customers who only subscribe to our SaaS offering, which estimate is derived by applying the ratio of active Success-Based Pricing customers to loans originated by these customers to the number of active SaaS users of Encompass for the same period of time.\nRevenues per loan. Revenue per loan is the sum of our revenues for the applicable period of time divided by Estimated Encompass closed loans originated during the same period.\nThe following table shows these operating metrics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues (in thousands):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>480,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>417,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>360,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contracted revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>349,545\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>283,183\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>208,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Users:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Active users\n</td> <td>186,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>183,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>164,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average active users during the period\n</td> <td>190,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Encompass closed loans\n</td> <td>2,596,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,552,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,507,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues per loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>185\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we apply the provisions of Topic 606 for revenue recognition on contracts with customers. Pursuant to Topic 606, we recognize revenues under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the following five step approach is applied:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Determination of the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We generate revenues primarily from cloud-based subscription services, transaction-based fees and related services, including professional services and our annual user conference, and recognize revenues as performance obligations are satisfied. Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from transaction price.\nOur revenues are generated from subscriptions to our cloud-based Encompass platform that customers access through the Internet. Our revenues are also comprised of fees for software services sold both as a subscription and on a transactional basis, including fees based on a per closed loan, or success basis, subject to monthly base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, as well as Ellie Mae Network fees, fees for loan product, policy and guideline data and analytics services, fees for lead management, marketing and customer relationship management, and fees for professional services which include consulting, implementation, and education and training services.\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of: salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense; data center operating costs; depreciation on data center computer equipment; amortization of internal-use software and acquired intangible assets such as developed technology; customer support; professional services associated with implementation of our software; third-party royalty expenses; and allocated facilities costs. We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we make additional and accelerated investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and data security, as we place new internal-use software into service. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in key areas such as development of internal-use software, technical support, data security, and data center infrastructure to better support our customers and further differentiate ourselves. This includes development of our next generation Encompass platform, which we expect to continue to roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020, as well as our continuous effort to move toward a hybrid cloud architecture.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions; allocated facilities costs; expenses for trade shows, public relations, our annual user conference, and other promotional and marketing activities; expenses for travel and entertainment; and amortization of acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we pursue additional strategic customer acquisitions and as our annual user conference continues to increase in size.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of: salaries and benefits, including bonuses and stock-based compensation expense; fees to contractors engaged in the development of the Encompass software, Ellie Mae Network, and other products; and allocated facilities costs. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our products and services, related next-generation enhancements and in our scalability efforts to expand our platform, including hiring additional engineering and product development personnel, and as we pursue additional strategic acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of: salaries and benefits, including bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees involved in finance, accounting, human resources, administration, information technology, and legal; third-party provider expenses such as general consulting, legal, accounting, and other professional services; and allocated facilities costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our facilities, hire additional personnel, and invest in our back-office infrastructure to enhance our system capacity, reliability, and security.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income earned on investments and cash accounts and investment premium accretion, offset by investment discount amortization, interest expense paid on equipment and software leases, and loss on the disposal of fixed assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, income taxes, stock-based compensation, goodwill and intangible assets, fair value of investments, deferred contract costs, and software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply the provisions of Topic 606 for revenue recognition on contracts with customers. Pursuant to Topic 606, we recognize revenues under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the following five step approach is applied:\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Determination of the transaction price;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We generate revenues primarily from cloud-based subscription services, transaction-based fees, and related services including professional services and our annual user conference, and recognize revenues as performance obligations are satisfied. For subscription services where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance, revenues are recognized over time using an output method based on the passage of time as this provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of control. Under Encompass subscriptions that customers access through the Internet, revenues are comprised of software services sold both as a subscription and on a variable basis. Variable fees include fees billed on a per closed loan, or success basis, subject to monthly base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing. Other cloud-based subscription services consist of policy, guideline, data and analytics, lead management, marketing, and customer relationship management. Transaction-based fees are comprised of Ellie Mae Network fees and transaction fees charged for other services, including fees for loan products and the annual user conference. Fees for professional services include consulting, implementation, and education and training services. Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from the transaction price.\nIn contracts where recognizing variable consideration in the month it is earned does not meet the allocation objective of Topic 606, variable consideration is estimated and included in the transaction price. We estimate such amounts at contract inception considering historical trends, industry data, and contract specific factors to determine an expected amount to which we expect to be entitled. Estimates are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The assessment of whether such an estimate is constrained requires us to consider methods, inputs, and assumptions relating to the nature of the underlying products, customer-specific trends, and economic factors including industry data. Other forms of variable consideration such as refunds and penalties, which are recorded in accrued and other current liabilities, are estimated at contract inception and are allocated to the performance obligations to which they relate.\nWe enter into arrangements that generally include multiple subscriptions and professional services. For arrangements with multiple services, we evaluate whether the individual services qualify as distinct performance obligations. In our assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, we determine whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources and whether the service is separately identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires that we assess the nature of each individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services are significantly integrated, highly interrelated, or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract.\nWhen agreements involve multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate arrangement consideration to all performance obligations at the inception of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation. Where we have standalone sales data for performance obligations which are indicative of the price at which we sell a promised good or service separately to a customer, such data is used to establish standalone selling prices. In instances where standalone sales data is not available for a particular performance obligation, we estimate standalone selling prices by maximizing the use of observable market and cost-based inputs.\nWhen estimating standalone selling prices, we review company-specific factors used to determine list price and make adjustments as appropriate to reflect current market conditions and pricing behavior. Our process for establishing list price includes assessing the cost to provide a particular product or service, surveying customers to determine market expectations, analyzing customer demographics, and taking into account our similar products and services historically sold. We continue to review the factors used to establish list price and will adjust standalone selling price methodologies as necessary on a prospective basis.\nCloud-Based Subscription Revenues. Cloud-based subscription revenues generally include a combination of our products delivered as SaaS subscriptions that are a performance obligation consisting of a series of distinct services and support services. These arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. These revenues typically include the following:\nEncompass Revenues. We offer web-based, on-demand access to our cloud-based Encompass platform which has been determined to be a stand-ready obligation. Revenues are recognized over the contract terms as performance obligations are satisfied as this method best depicts the pattern of performance for such services. Contracts generally range from one year to five years.\nSome Encompass customers elect to pay on a success basis. Success basis contracts are subject to monthly billing calculations whereby customers are obligated to pay the greater of a contractual base fee or variable closed loan fee based on the number of closed loan transactions processed by the customer in the specific month. Under success basis contracts, monthly base fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as subscription performance obligations are satisfied and closed loan fees in excess of base fees are considered variable consideration.\nFor the majority of Encompass contracts that include variable consideration, such fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the Encompass platform for that period, consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606.\nFor certain contracts where the allocation objective would not be met by allocating variable consideration in this way, total variable consideration to be received is estimated at contract inception and recognized ratably over the contract term. The estimates of the total variable consideration expected to be received under such agreements is updated at each reporting date. For these contracts, variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method, utilizing forecast data for each contract to determine the expected value.\nWe evaluate our ability to accurately estimate such variable consideration considering all relevant facts and circumstances associated with both the likelihood of a downward adjustment in the estimate of variable consideration and the potential magnitude of a significant revenue reversal relative to the cumulative revenue recognized to-date under the contract. Because the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to broad economic factors outside our influence, have a broad range of possible consideration amounts, and the uncertainty is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time, our ability to accurately estimate the variable consideration is limited. Therefore, the amount of variable consideration included in the transactions price is constrained to ensure that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the amount of variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nOther Subscription Revenues. We provide a variety of mortgage-related and other business services, including lead management, marketing, compliance services and customer relationship management. Such services include fixed fee subscriptions and are a single performance obligation consisting of a series of distinct services. These fixed fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as this method best depicts our pattern of performance for such services. Variable fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing the access to services for that period, consistent with the allocation objective.\nOnline Research and Data Resources Subscription Revenues. We provide mortgage originators and underwriters with access to online databases of various federal and state laws and regulations and forms as well as investor product guidelines. Fixed fees are recognized over time, using an output method of the passage of time or ratably over the contract terms as this method best depicts our pattern of performance for such services.\nTransactional Revenues. Transactional revenues include the following:\nEllie Mae Network Revenues. We have entered into agreements with various lenders, service providers and certain government-sponsored entities participating in the mortgage origination process to provide those suppliers with access to, and ability to interoperate with, mortgage originators on the Ellie Mae Network. The services delivered are comprised of a performance obligation consisting of a series of distinct services. We act as an agent when arranging for services to be provided by the supplier to the customer. Fixed fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as this method best depicts our pattern of performance for such services. Variable fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the allocation objective is met by allocating the fees to each distinct month in the series.\nOther Transactional Revenues. We provide other services delivered on a transactional basis including automated documentation; fraud detection, valuation, validation, and risk analysis; income verification; flood zone certifications; website and electronic document management; compliance reports; and our annual user conference. Fees are recognized as transactions occur which is the point in time when control is transferred. Variable fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing the access to services for that period, consistent with the allocation objective.\nProfessional Services Revenues. Professional services, including implementation services for our subscription products, are performance obligations which are determined to be distinct from our subscription services and other performance obligations. Such services are generally provided on a time and materials or fixed price basis and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance. The majority of our professional services are provided on a fixed price basis, and we recognize revenue over time as the performance obligations are satisfied utilizing an input method based on the proportion of hours incurred to total estimated hours. Any changes in the estimate of progress towards completion are accounted for in the period of change using the cumulative catch-up method. Revenues from professional services contracts provided on a time and materials basis are recognized when invoiced under the practical expedient as amounts correspond directly with the value of the services rendered to date.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of the enacted tax law.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. We recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision.\nValuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period, we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our statements of comprehensive income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense related to restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, and performance-vesting restricted stock units based on the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. Expense related to the RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which generally equals the vesting period. Expense related to the performance shares and performance-vesting RSUs is recognized under the graded vesting method over the requisite service period of the award, which results in the recognition of a larger portion of the expense during the beginning of the vesting period than in the end of the vesting period. We evaluate the probability of performance attainment, estimate the number of shares of common stock that will be granted, and record the expense accordingly.\nWe recognize compensation expense related to stock option grants that are ultimately expected to vest and shares issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP\u201d) based on estimated fair values on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expense related to stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. Expense related to shares issued under the ESPP is recognized on a straight-line basis over the offering period.\nThe date of grant is the date at which we reach a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award with the employee, appropriate approvals are received by the equity incentive committee of the board of directors, and we become contingently obligated to issue equity instruments to the employee who renders the requisite service.\nWe estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust recorded compensation cost accordingly. The estimate of forfeitures is based on historical experience and is adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the prior estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized in the period of change and will impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense to be recognized in future periods.\nGoodwill\nWe record goodwill in a business combination when the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The annual test is performed at the reporting unit level using a fair-value based approach. Our operations are organized as one reporting unit. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, we first compare the net aggregate carrying value of assets and liabilities to our aggregate estimated fair value. If estimated fair value is less than carrying value, then potential impairment exists. Impairment is equivalent to any excess of goodwill carrying value over its implied fair value.\nThe process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis, including calculating fair value of the reporting unit based on estimated future cash flows and discount rates to be applied.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets include developed technology, trade names, customer relationships, and order backlog. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated periods of benefit, as follows:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Developed technology\n</td> <td>2-8 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade names with finite lives\n</td> <td>2-3 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer relationships\n</td> <td>4-10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Order backlog\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe AllRegs tradename is the only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. We evaluate the remaining useful life of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. We test intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually or if events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. If potential impairment exists, the amount of any impairment is calculated by using a discounted cash flow model, which is based on the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe evaluate our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If such assets or asset groups are considered to be impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets or asset groups exceed the fair value of the assets or asset groups. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\nFair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments\nWe invest excess cash primarily in money market funds and investment-grade, fixed maturity interest-bearing debt securities, such as certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, municipal and government agency obligations, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. All of our investments that have maturities of greater than 90 days are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are reported in stockholders' equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. Interest and dividends are included in other income (expense), net when they are earned.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.\nWe classify our money market funds and U.S. government obligations as Level 1 instruments due to the use of observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in active markets.\nWhen we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in less active markets, we classify our marketable financial instruments as Level 2. When observable market prices for identical securities are not available, we price our marketable financial instruments using non-binding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data; quoted market prices for similar instruments; or pricing models with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data. Non-binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers. These valuation models incorporate a number of inputs, including non-binding and binding broker quotes; observable market prices for identical or similar securities; and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and, to a lesser degree, unobservable market inputs. We corroborate non-binding market consensus prices with observable market data as such data exists.\nWe had no investments classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016.\nThe fair values of our cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the short maturities of the instruments. The fair value of our capital lease obligations approximates the carrying value due to the terms continuing to approximate prevailing market terms.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs mainly consist of sales commissions and related fringe benefits that are incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers, as well as partners' referral fees. We amortize the costs incurred on initial contracts on a straight-line basis over an estimated period of benefit of approximately five years. The period of benefit is determined based on a review of customer churn rates and technological lifecycles of the underlying product offerings. All deferred contract costs on renewal contracts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the applicable renewal period. Additionally, we exercise the practical expedient to expense commissions on arrangements in which the amortization period is expected to be one year or less. Deferred contract costs that will be recognized during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded as prepaid expenses and other current assets, and the remaining portion is recorded as deposits and other long-term assets.\nSoftware and Website Development Costs\nWe capitalize internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use software and website applications. Capitalized internal costs include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for employees that are directly involved in developing the software or website application, and depreciation of assets used in the development process. Capitalized external costs include third-party consultants involved in the development process, as well as other direct costs incurred therein.\nCapitalization of costs begins when the preliminary project stage has been completed, management authorizes and commits to funding a project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software or website application will be used to perform the function intended. Internal and external costs incurred as part of the preliminary project stage are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalization ceases at the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Internal and external training costs and maintenance costs during the post-implementation operation stage are expensed as incurred.\nInternal-developed core software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of five years. Amortization of product related internal-use software and website applications is recorded in cost of revenues, and amortization of other internal-use software and website applications is recorded to the operating expense line to which it most closely relates. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. The capitalized costs are included in property and equipment, net on our balance sheet.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenues for those periods.

The increase in the research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expenses related to increased headcount and fees to contractors as we continued to invest in our products and services.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,686\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>71,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative as a % of revenues\n</td> <td>20.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expenses increased by $17.4 million, or 21.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by 1.1 percentage points. The increase in the general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $5.0 million increase in salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits related to increased headcount, a $4.4 million increase in professional services, and a $4.2 million increase in fees to contractors mostly related to the adoption of the new revenue standard.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses increased by $8.4 million, or 11.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by 0.7 percentage points. The increase in the general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $4.2 million increase in salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits related to increased headcount and a $1.4 million increase in third-party services related to consulting services.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income earned on investments and cash accounts and investment premium accretion, offset by investment discount amortization, interest expense paid on equipment and software leases, and loss on the disposal of fixed assets. Other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $3.9 million, $3.3 million, and $1.0 million respectively, primarily due to increased investments' income.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recorded a provision expense (benefit) for income taxes of $(7.8) million, $(7.5) million, and $18.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Our effective tax rate for the year 2018 differs from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, primarily due to the income tax benefits from excess stock-based compensation deductions, research and development credits, and a reduction in the state blended income tax rate, offset by income tax expense related to the measurement of certain deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act.\nOur effective tax rate for the year 2017 differs from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, primary due to the income tax benefit from re-measurement of net deferred tax liabilities related to the enacted change to the corporate tax rate in December 2017, excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation from the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, and federal research and development credits.\nOur effective tax rate for the year 2016 slightly differs from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, primarily due to non-deductible expenses and state income taxes, offset by federal research and development credits. Refer to Note 9 Income Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements for more information about our effective tax rates.\nThe valuation allowance increased by $4.4 million in 2018, increased by $6.8 million in 2017, and increased by $1.2 million in 2016. The valuation allowance is primarily against the deferred tax assets related to certain state research and development tax credits and net operating losses, the realization of which are uncertain as we expect to generate additional credits at a faster rate than our ability to utilize them. We will continue to regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by evaluating all available evidence, both positive and negative, that may exist. Any adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recorded in the income statement for the periods that the adjustment is determined to be required.\nIn December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which allows companies to record provisional amounts for the Tax Act during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date in order for companies to complete their accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes. In December 2018, we finalized our accounting for the Tax Act. Adjustments included an additional $1.2 million tax expenses recorded in September 2018 for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets related to Velocify acquisition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $302.6 million and long-term investments of $62.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, money market funds, and highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. Both short and long-term investments consist of U.S. government notes, and U.S. government agency securities, corporate bonds and obligations, certificates of deposit and municipal obligations.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures, operating expenses and other cash requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have used our cash and investments to repurchase our stock and may continue to do so in future periods. Acquisitions that we enter into are funded by our cash and investments or may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing. Additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nThe following table sets forth our statements of cash flows data for the periods presented:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>116,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>112,899\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(65,192\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(329,032\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(44,598\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,482\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,398\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(243,209\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $7.5 million from $116.2 million in 2017 to $123.7 million in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased revenues and related cash collections, partially offset by higher payments for operating expenses primarily driven by increased headcount, costs related to the integration of Velocify, and an increase in professional and consulting services due to the adoption of the new revenue standard.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.3 million from $112.9 million in 2016 to $116.2 million in 2017. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increased revenue and related cash collections, partially offset by higher payments for operating expenses primarily driven by increased headcount and costs related to the integration of Velocify.\nInvesting Activities\nOur primary investing activities have consisted of acquisitions, purchases and maturities of investments, and purchases of property and equipment (including costs incurred to develop internal-use software). Purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations and the timing of our internal-use software projects subject to capitalization. We plan to continue to invest in the expansion of our operations and facilities as well as the next generation Encompass platform, and we intend to continue pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nCash used in investing activities of $65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of $24.3 million in expenditures for purchases of property, including capital improvements to our corporate headquarters, investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and security, $68.9 million in expenditures incurred to develop internal-use software and website applications, including the development of our next generation Encompass Digital Lending platform, and $136.2 million in purchases of investments, offset by $164.0 million in maturities of investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $329.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of $119.3 million in cash payments for the Velocify acquisition, $28.4 million in expenditures for purchases of property, including capital improvements to our corporate headquarters, investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and security, $59.5 million in expenditures incurred to develop internal-use software and website applications, including the development of our next generation Encompass Digital Lending platform, and $221.4 million in purchases of investments, offset by $99.5 million in maturities of investments.\nCash used in investing activities of $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of $25.2 million in expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, including capital improvements to our new corporate headquarters, investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and security, $35.1 million in expenditures incurred to develop internal-use software and website applications, including the development of our next generation Encompass Digital Lending platform, and $62.5 million in purchases of investments, offset by $78.2 million in sales and maturities of investments.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities have consisted primarily of cash provided from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan, reduced by the payments related to capital lease obligations, repurchases of common stock, and tax payments related to shares withheld for vested RSUs. In August 2016, we completed a public offering of common stock and sold approximately 3,163 thousand shares of our common stock for total cash proceeds of approximately $271.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, and offering costs and expenses of approximately $13.2 million, which will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. We may also use the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions, or businesses that complement our business. In August 2017, our audit committee, under the authority delegated to it by our board of directors, approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $250.0 million of our common stock, which expires in August 2020. As of December 31, 2018, $200.0 million remained available for repurchases. Under the program, purchases may be made from time to time on the open market, and will be funded from available working capital.\nCash used in financing activities of $14.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of $14.7 million in common stock repurchases and $19.0 million in tax payments related to shares withheld for vested RSUs, offset by $19.4 million in proceeds from employee stock purchases and the exercise of stock options.\nCash used in financing activities of $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted primarily of $35.2 million in common stock repurchases and $13.8 million in tax payments related to shares withheld for vested RSUs, offset by $19.3 million in proceeds from employee stock purchases and the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities of $278.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted primarily of $271.4 million in net proceeds from our August 2016 public offering of 3,163 thousand shares of common stock, $17.3 million in proceeds from employee stock purchase and exercise of stock options, partially offset by $6.0 million in tax payments related to shares withheld for vested RSUs, payments of capital leases of $3.8 million, and $0.7 million in common stock repurchases.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, and operating leases were the only financing arrangements not reported on our financial statements.\nContractual Obligations\nAt December 31, 2018, our contractual payment obligations are as follows:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period (as of December 31, 2018)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>85,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td>57,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>144,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________\n(1) Purchase obligations are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum services to be used; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPending Transaction\nOn February 11, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with EM Eagle Purchaser, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Parent\u201d), and EM Eagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for our acquisition by private equity investment firm Thoma Bravo, LLC in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.7 billion (the Transaction\u201d). If the Transaction is completed, our stockholders will be entitled to receive $99.00 in cash for each share of our common stock they hold as of the effective time of the Transaction. The Transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2019, subject to approval by our stockholders and regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. See Note 14 Subsequent Event\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements for further details.\nOverview\nWe are the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry. Our technology solutions are used by lenders to originate and close residential mortgage loans. Banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders use our Encompass\u00ae all-in-one mortgage management solution to originate and fund mortgages and improve compliance, loan quality, and efficiency.\nMortgage originators use our Encompass software, a comprehensive digital mortgage solution that handles key business and management functions involved in running a residential mortgage origination business. Mortgage originators use Encompass as a single tool for marketing, loan origination, processing, and customer communication, and to interact electronically with lenders, investors, and service providers over the Ellie Mae Network. Our software also enables enforcement of rules and business practices designed to ensure loan quality, adherence to processing standards, and regulatory compliance.\nThe Ellie Mae Network electronically connects approximately 186,500 mortgage professionals using Encompass to the broad array of third-party service providers, mortgage lenders, and investors integral to the origination and funding of residential mortgages. During the mortgage origination process, mortgage originators may order various services through the Ellie Mae Network, including credit reports, product eligibility and pricing services, automated underwriting services, appraisals, title reports, insurance, flood certifications and flood insurance, compliance reviews, fraud detection, document preparation, and verification of income, identity, and employment. Mortgage originators can also initiate secure data transmission to and from lenders and investors.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method and applied Topic 606 to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and are reported under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nOur revenues are generated primarily from subscriptions to the cloud-based Encompass platform, including customers who pay fees based on the number of loans they close, subject to base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, or recurring monthly subscription fees and related professional services such as consulting, implementation, and training services. Our revenues also include software-related services that are sold on a transactional basis; Ellie Mae Network fees; fees for education and training; and loan product, policy and guideline data and analytics services.\nSeasonality and Current Industry Trends\nOur revenues generally follow the seasonality of the residential mortgage industry, with increased activity in the second and third quarters and reduced activity in the first and fourth quarters as home buyers tend to purchase their homes during the spring and summer. Mortgage volumes are also impacted by other factors such as interest rate fluctuations, home sale activity and pricing, regulatory changes, and general economic conditions, which can lead to departures from the typical seasonal pattern. A combination of tight housing inventory and rising mortgage interest rates resulted in a decline in mortgage volumes in 2018 relative to 2017. Although the market for mortgages is expected to transition to one in which increasing volumes are driven primarily by demand for home purchases, a tight housing supply in certain markets is currently limiting the rate of growth in purchase volumes.\nWe currently estimate that approximately 25% to 35% of our revenues have some direct sensitivity to volume. The base fee portion of success-based revenues, subscription revenues, and professional services revenues are generally not affected by fluctuations in mortgage origination volume. The impact on our revenues from a substantial decline in mortgage volumes is difficult to predict and subject to risk and uncertainty. Refer to the risks relating to a decline in mortgage lending volumes described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nOur Investments\nWe are investing aggressively in initiatives that we believe will help us continue to grow our business, improve our products and services, and strengthen our competitive advantage while bringing sustainable long-term value to our customers. Our recent launch of Encompass Developer Connect, Encompass Data Connect, and Encompass Investor Connect will enable developers to create new features for Encompass, easily integrate Encompass with external systems and data, and build and deploy custom applications in the cloud. In addition, lenders are also looking for a technology partner to deliver a better digital mortgage experience to consumers. We recently made generally available Encompass Consumer Connect, which enables our customers to originate loans directly from borrowers by offering an online loan application that can be accessed by anyone with a web browser. Furthermore, our acquisition of Velocify accelerates our vision of offering a fully digital mortgage by combining Velocify's lead management, engagement, and distribution capabilities with Encompass Consumer Connect.\nIn 2017 and 2018, we increased our investment in research and development, technology infrastructure, and data security to support our growing user base. This includes the roll out of our Connect solutions, the development of our hybrid cloud infrastructure, the additions and updates to loan applications required by the redesigned URLA, and the development of our next generation Encompass platform and capabilities, which we expect to continue to progressively roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020.\nWe have also invested in our sales and client services capabilities to continue to increase sales of our products and to assist our customers in implementing our solutions. To continue to support customers as we grow our business and further differentiate ourselves, we intend to invest in key areas, such as research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, data security, and our hybrid cloud infrastructure. We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase as we make additional and accelerated investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and data security, and as we place new internal-use software into service.\nIn addition to our internal initiatives, our business strategy has evolved in response to recent industry trends as follows:\nGreater focus on operational efficiencies. The average total production cost per loan was $8,174 in the third quarter of 2018(1). We expect operational costs to continue to be a significant consideration for mortgage originators due to the continuously changing regulatory environment and heightened quality standards. By automating many of the functions of mortgage origination, we enable our users to comply with regulations and process quality loans more efficiently and effectively. This reduces the cost of originating loans and lowers the risk of buy-back demands from investors resulting from poorly originated or documented loans or loans that fail to comply with applicable regulations. We continually address the changing needs of our customers by developing and enhancing tools to allow for simplified regulatory compliance, increased availability of information, and enhanced system functionality and performance.\nWith an eye towards providing customers with ever-improving tools to enhance efficiency, we currently anticipate that we will continue to develop new service offerings through the Ellie Mae Network and encourage adoption of our services through initiatives such as our Encompass Connect Solutions. By integrating and expanding our current and new services, we aim to provide a more comprehensive solution to our users.\nCustomers adopting multi-channel strategies. Customers are developing multi-channel strategies beyond a single retail, correspondent, or wholesale mortgage lending channel in order to grow their businesses. The requirements of these different channels vary, and in order to maintain a single operating system, customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality. Encompass includes support for multi-channel workflows, allowing our customers to drive efficiencies and boost productivity by creating distinct workflows for each channel that map to our customers' business needs. Encompass users can customize workflows based on channel, loan purpose or specific loan criteria - all of which can vary between lending channels. With the introduction of Encompass TPO Connect, Encompass users are able to utilize a customizable and interactive web experience for wholesale and correspondent lending channels, which gives lenders and investors a modern and collaborative web experience for their TPO partners that promotes compliance, data integrity, and easy bi-directional communication throughout the entire loan process. Additionally, Encompass Consumer Connect supports our customers' retail channel by enabling our customers to originate loans directly from borrowers by offering an online loan application that can be accessed by anyone with a web browser.\nChanges in regulation affecting lenders and investors. Mortgage lending regulations continue to change and many regulatory reforms have been introduced or proposed in recent years to promote increased underwriting standards and accountability by lenders and mortgage originators, ensure meaningful disclosures by lenders to borrowers, increase the transparency and objectivity of settlement services, and protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abusive lending practices. We devote considerable resources to continually upgrade our software to help our customers address regulatory changes. We offer Encompass Compliance Service, which analyzes mortgage loan data for compliance with consumer protection laws and institutionally mandated compliance policies and also alerts users to possible violations of these laws and policies. In addition, we have a staff of attorneys who work with compliance experts and help ensure that documents prepared using our software and the processes recommended by the Encompass workflow comply with applicable rules and regulations. For example, additional tools and product updates were required to address the Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage and Federal and State High Cost rules that became effective in January 2014. In addition, we updated certain of our products to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule changes that took effect in October 2015, and are providing complete offering of readiness initiatives, tools and training programs in advance of the 2018 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C collection and reporting changes which take effect through 2020. We are also making substantial changes to our products and services to accommodate the upcoming February 2020 adoption deadline for the redesigned Uniform Residential Loan Application. We believe we are well-positioned to help our customers comply with changing regulatory requirements as they are published and become effective. However, changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the residential mortgage industry could require us to incur significant costs to update our products and services so that our customers remain compliant with such laws and regulations.\nConsumer Demand for a Digital Based Experience from Lenders. Today's borrowers expect transparency, service and speed, and a human touch. To meet these requirements, lenders must offer a seamless, online experience that continues even after the application has been submitted. It is our goal to provide a true digital mortgage process that enables the lender to originate more loans, lower origination costs, reduce the time to close and make smarter decisions through data and predictive analytics, all while ensuring the highest levels of compliance, quality and efficiency. Our digital mortgage vision encompasses all phases of the mortgage loan lifecycle, with each milestone in the mortgage origination process informing the next.\nIncreased quality standards imposed by regulators, lenders, and investors. Lenders have eliminated many high-risk loan product offerings and significantly tightened underwriting and processing requirements. Similarly, investors seek higher-quality, lower-risk loans in which to invest. Encompass is designed to automate and streamline the process of originating mortgages to, among other things, satisfy increased quality requirements of investors. Relevant features of Encompass include enabling customers' management to impose processing rules and formats, and providing milestone and process reminders, automated population of forms with accurate data, and accurate and automated transmission of loan files and data from originators to investors and lenders.\nIn response to the increased quality standards and compliance mandates affecting the industry, we expect many non-Encompass mortgage lenders to assess new platform options and replace their legacy systems. We have increased the size of our customer acquisition, implementation, and support teams in order to address anticipated demand for our software solutions.\nGreater focus by customers and regulators on data security and consumer privacy. Recent high-profile data security incidents affecting banking institutions and their third-party service providers have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our customers and our customers' regulators. We are making significant investments in the security of the Encompass service, as well as our internal systems, processes, and monitoring capabilities to protect our customers' data and help minimize the risk of data security loss. We expect the industry focus on data security to continue to increase, and we anticipate that our investments in data security will increase substantially over time.\n________________\n(1) Mortgage Bankers Association, IBM Profits Lag in the Third Quarter, November 29, 2018.\nIncrease the number of lenders using Encompass and the number of loans originated on our platform. In addition to addressing the industry trends discussed above, we continue to focus our marketing, sales and product development efforts on increasing the number of mortgage lenders, commercial banks and credit unions using Encompass and our additional services, and the number of loans originated on our platform. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on all market segments, including the largest, or enterprise segment, of the lending industry.\nOperating Metrics\nWe use certain operational metrics to evaluate our business, determine allocation of our resources, and make decisions regarding corporate strategy. We focus on these metrics to determine our success in leveraging our user base to increase our revenues and to gauge the degree of our market penetration.\nOur key operating metrics are defined below.\nContracted revenues. Contracted revenues are those revenues that are fixed by the terms of a contract and are generally not affected by fluctuations in mortgage origination volume. These revenues consist of the base fee portion of Success-Based Pricing revenues, monthly per-user subscription revenues, professional services revenues, and subscription revenues paid for products other than Encompass.\nActive users. An active user is a mortgage origination professional who has used Encompass at least once within a 90-day period preceding the measurement date. A user is a mortgage origination professional working at an Encompass mortgage lender, such as a mortgage bank, commercial bank, thrift or credit union, which sources and funds loans and generally sells these funded loans to investors; or a mortgage brokerage, which typically processes and submits loan files to a mortgage lender or mega lender that funds the loan.\nAverage active users. Average active users during a period is calculated by averaging the monthly active users during a reporting period.\nEstimated Encompass closed loans. Estimated Encompass closed loans is an estimate of the number of loans originated by Encompass users, calculated as loans originated by our Success-Based Pricing customers, which does not include certain brokered loans or correspondent purchased loans, plus an estimate of the number of loans originated by Encompass customers who only subscribe to our SaaS offering, which estimate is derived by applying the ratio of active Success-Based Pricing customers to loans originated by these customers to the number of active SaaS users of Encompass for the same period of time.\nRevenues per loan. Revenue per loan is the sum of our revenues for the applicable period of time divided by Estimated Encompass closed loans originated during the same period.\nThe following table shows these operating metrics as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016:\n\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenue Recognition\nEffective January 1, 2018, we apply the provisions of Topic 606 for revenue recognition on contracts with customers. Pursuant to Topic 606, we recognize revenues under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the following five step approach is applied:\n \u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; \n \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u2022 Determination of the transaction price; \n \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.  We generate revenues primarily from cloud-based subscription services, transaction-based fees and related services, including professional services and our annual user conference, and recognize revenues as performance obligations are satisfied. Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from transaction price.\nOur revenues are generated from subscriptions to our cloud-based Encompass platform that customers access through the Internet. Our revenues are also comprised of fees for software services sold both as a subscription and on a transactional basis, including fees based on a per closed loan, or success basis, subject to monthly base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, as well as Ellie Mae Network fees, fees for loan product, policy and guideline data and analytics services, fees for lead management, marketing and customer relationship management, and fees for professional services which include consulting, implementation, and education and training services.\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of: salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense; data center operating costs; depreciation on data center computer equipment; amortization of internal-use software and acquired intangible assets such as developed technology; customer support; professional services associated with implementation of our software; third-party royalty expenses; and allocated facilities costs. We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we make additional and accelerated investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and data security, as we place new internal-use software into service. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in key areas such as development of internal-use software, technical support, data security, and data center infrastructure to better support our customers and further differentiate ourselves. This includes development of our next generation Encompass platform, which we expect to continue to roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020, as well as our continuous effort to move toward a hybrid cloud architecture.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions; allocated facilities costs; expenses for trade shows, public relations, our annual user conference, and other promotional and marketing activities; expenses for travel and entertainment; and amortization of acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we pursue additional strategic customer acquisitions and as our annual user conference continues to increase in size.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of: salaries and benefits, including bonuses and stock-based compensation expense; fees to contractors engaged in the development of the Encompass software, Ellie Mae Network, and other products; and allocated facilities costs. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our products and services, related next-generation enhancements and in our scalability efforts to expand our platform, including hiring additional engineering and product development personnel, and as we pursue additional strategic acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of: salaries and benefits, including bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees involved in finance, accounting, human resources, administration, information technology, and legal; third-party provider expenses such as general consulting, legal, accounting, and other professional services; and allocated facilities costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our facilities, hire additional personnel, and invest in our back-office infrastructure to enhance our system capacity, reliability, and security.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income earned on investments and cash accounts and investment premium accretion, offset by investment discount amortization, interest expense paid on equipment and software leases, and loss on the disposal of fixed assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, income taxes, stock-based compensation, goodwill and intangible assets, fair value of investments, deferred contract costs, and software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply the provisions of Topic 606 for revenue recognition on contracts with customers. Pursuant to Topic 606, we recognize revenues under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the following five step approach is applied:\n \u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; \n \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u2022 Determination of the transaction price; \n \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.  We generate revenues primarily from cloud-based subscription services, transaction-based fees, and related services including professional services and our annual user conference, and recognize revenues as performance obligations are satisfied. For subscription services where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance, revenues are recognized over time using an output method based on the passage of time as this provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of control. Under Encompass subscriptions that customers access through the Internet, revenues are comprised of software services sold both as a subscription and on a variable basis. Variable fees include fees billed on a per closed loan, or success basis, subject to monthly base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing. Other cloud-based subscription services consist of policy, guideline, data and analytics, lead management, marketing, and customer relationship management. Transaction-based fees are comprised of Ellie Mae Network fees and transaction fees charged for other services, including fees for loan products and the annual user conference. Fees for professional services include consulting, implementation, and education and training services. Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from the transaction price.\nIn contracts where recognizing variable consideration in the month it is earned does not meet the allocation objective of Topic 606, variable consideration is estimated and included in the transaction price. We estimate such amounts at contract inception considering historical trends, industry data, and contract specific factors to determine an expected amount to which we expect to be entitled. Estimates are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The assessment of whether such an estimate is constrained requires us to consider methods, inputs, and assumptions relating to the nature of the underlying products, customer-specific trends, and economic factors including industry data. Other forms of variable consideration such as refunds and penalties, which are recorded in accrued and other current liabilities, are estimated at contract inception and are allocated to the performance obligations to which they relate.\nWe enter into arrangements that generally include multiple subscriptions and professional services. For arrangements with multiple services, we evaluate whether the individual services qualify as distinct performance obligations. In our assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, we determine whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources and whether the service is separately identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires that we assess the nature of each individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services are significantly integrated, highly interrelated, or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract.\nWhen agreements involve multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate arrangement consideration to all performance obligations at the inception of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation. Where we have standalone sales data for performance obligations which are indicative of the price at which we sell a promised good or service separately to a customer, such data is used to establish standalone selling prices. In instances where standalone sales data is not available for a particular performance obligation, we estimate standalone selling prices by maximizing the use of observable market and cost-based inputs.\nWhen estimating standalone selling prices, we review company-specific factors used to determine list price and make adjustments as appropriate to reflect current market conditions and pricing behavior. Our process for establishing list price includes assessing the cost to provide a particular product or service, surveying customers to determine market expectations, analyzing customer demographics, and taking into account our similar products and services historically sold. We continue to review the factors used to establish list price and will adjust standalone selling price methodologies as necessary on a prospective basis.\nCloud-Based Subscription Revenues. Cloud-based subscription revenues generally include a combination of our products delivered as SaaS subscriptions that are a performance obligation consisting of a series of distinct services and support services. These arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. These revenues typically include the following:\nEncompass Revenues. We offer web-based, on-demand access to our cloud-based Encompass platform which has been determined to be a stand-ready obligation. Revenues are recognized over the contract terms as performance obligations are satisfied as this method best depicts the pattern of performance for such services. Contracts generally range from one year to five years.\nSome Encompass customers elect to pay on a success basis. Success basis contracts are subject to monthly billing calculations whereby customers are obligated to pay the greater of a contractual base fee or variable closed loan fee based on the number of closed loan transactions processed by the customer in the specific month. Under success basis contracts, monthly base fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as subscription performance obligations are satisfied and closed loan fees in excess of base fees are considered variable consideration.\nFor the majority of Encompass contracts that include variable consideration, such fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the Encompass platform for that period, consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606.\nFor certain contracts where the allocation objective would not be met by allocating variable consideration in this way, total variable consideration to be received is estimated at contract inception and recognized ratably over the contract term. The estimates of the total variable consideration expected to be received under such agreements is updated at each reporting date. For these contracts, variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method, utilizing forecast data for each contract to determine the expected value.\nWe evaluate our ability to accurately estimate such variable consideration considering all relevant facts and circumstances associated with both the likelihood of a downward adjustment in the estimate of variable consideration and the potential magnitude of a significant revenue reversal relative to the cumulative revenue recognized to-date under the contract. Because the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to broad economic factors outside our influence, have a broad range of possible consideration amounts, and the uncertainty", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors\u201d included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPending Transaction\nOn February 11, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) with EM Eagle Purchaser, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Parent\u201d), and EM Eagle Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ( Merger Sub\u201d), providing for our acquisition by private equity investment firm Thoma Bravo, LLC in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.7 billion (the Transaction\u201d). If the Transaction is completed, our stockholders will be entitled to receive $99.00 in cash for each share of our common stock they hold as of the effective time of the Transaction. The Transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2019, subject to approval by our stockholders and regulatory authorities and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. See Note 14 Subsequent Event\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements for further details.\nOverview\nWe are the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry. Our technology solutions are used by lenders to originate and close residential mortgage loans. Banks, credit unions, and mortgage lenders use our Encompass\u00ae all-in-one mortgage management solution to originate and fund mortgages and improve compliance, loan quality, and efficiency.\nMortgage originators use our Encompass software, a comprehensive digital mortgage solution that handles key business and management functions involved in running a residential mortgage origination business. Mortgage originators use Encompass as a single tool for marketing, loan origination, processing, and customer communication, and to interact electronically with lenders, investors, and service providers over the Ellie Mae Network. Our software also enables enforcement of rules and business practices designed to ensure loan quality, adherence to processing standards, and regulatory compliance.\nThe Ellie Mae Network electronically connects approximately 186,500 mortgage professionals using Encompass to the broad array of third-party service providers, mortgage lenders, and investors integral to the origination and funding of residential mortgages. During the mortgage origination process, mortgage originators may order various services through the Ellie Mae Network, including credit reports, product eligibility and pricing services, automated underwriting services, appraisals, title reports, insurance, flood certifications and flood insurance, compliance reviews, fraud detection, document preparation, and verification of income, identity, and employment. Mortgage originators can also initiate secure data transmission to and from lenders and investors.\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended (Topic 606) using the modified retrospective method and applied Topic 606 to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and are reported under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nOur revenues are generated primarily from subscriptions to the cloud-based Encompass platform, including customers who pay fees based on the number of loans they close, subject to base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, or recurring monthly subscription fees and related professional services such as consulting, implementation, and training services. Our revenues also include software-related services that are sold on a transactional basis; Ellie Mae Network fees; fees for education and training; and loan product, policy and guideline data and analytics services.\nSeasonality and Current Industry Trends\nOur revenues generally follow the seasonality of the residential mortgage industry, with increased activity in the second and third quarters and reduced activity in the first and fourth quarters as home buyers tend to purchase their homes during the spring and summer. Mortgage volumes are also impacted by other factors such as interest rate fluctuations, home sale activity and pricing, regulatory changes, and general economic conditions, which can lead to departures from the typical seasonal pattern. A combination of tight housing inventory and rising mortgage interest rates resulted in a decline in mortgage volumes in 2018 relative to 2017. Although the market for mortgages is expected to transition to one in which increasing volumes are driven primarily by demand for home purchases, a tight housing supply in certain markets is currently limiting the rate of growth in purchase volumes.\nWe currently estimate that approximately 25% to 35% of our revenues have some direct sensitivity to volume. The base fee portion of success-based revenues, subscription revenues, and professional services revenues are generally not affected by fluctuations in mortgage origination volume. The impact on our revenues from a substantial decline in mortgage volumes is difficult to predict and subject to risk and uncertainty. Refer to the risks relating to a decline in mortgage lending volumes described in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d for additional information.\nOur Investments\nWe are investing aggressively in initiatives that we believe will help us continue to grow our business, improve our products and services, and strengthen our competitive advantage while bringing sustainable long-term value to our customers. Our recent launch of Encompass Developer Connect, Encompass Data Connect, and Encompass Investor Connect will enable developers to create new features for Encompass, easily integrate Encompass with external systems and data, and build and deploy custom applications in the cloud. In addition, lenders are also looking for a technology partner to deliver a better digital mortgage experience to consumers. We recently made generally available Encompass Consumer Connect, which enables our customers to originate loans directly from borrowers by offering an online loan application that can be accessed by anyone with a web browser. Furthermore, our acquisition of Velocify accelerates our vision of offering a fully digital mortgage by combining Velocify's lead management, engagement, and distribution capabilities with Encompass Consumer Connect.\nIn 2017 and 2018, we increased our investment in research and development, technology infrastructure, and data security to support our growing user base. This includes the roll out of our Connect solutions, the development of our hybrid cloud infrastructure, the additions and updates to loan applications required by the redesigned URLA, and the development of our next generation Encompass platform and capabilities, which we expect to continue to progressively roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020.\nWe have also invested in our sales and client services capabilities to continue to increase sales of our products and to assist our customers in implementing our solutions. To continue to support customers as we grow our business and further differentiate ourselves, we intend to invest in key areas, such as research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, data security, and our hybrid cloud infrastructure. We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase as we make additional and accelerated investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and data security, and as we place new internal-use software into service.\nIn addition to our internal initiatives, our business strategy has evolved in response to recent industry trends as follows:\nGreater focus on operational efficiencies. The average total production cost per loan was $8,174 in the third quarter of 2018(1). We expect operational costs to continue to be a significant consideration for mortgage originators due to the continuously changing regulatory environment and heightened quality standards. By automating many of the functions of mortgage origination, we enable our users to comply with regulations and process quality loans more efficiently and effectively. This reduces the cost of originating loans and lowers the risk of buy-back demands from investors resulting from poorly originated or documented loans or loans that fail to comply with applicable regulations. We continually address the changing needs of our customers by developing and enhancing tools to allow for simplified regulatory compliance, increased availability of information, and enhanced system functionality and performance.\nWith an eye towards providing customers with ever-improving tools to enhance efficiency, we currently anticipate that we will continue to develop new service offerings through the Ellie Mae Network and encourage adoption of our services through initiatives such as our Encompass Connect Solutions. By integrating and expanding our current and new services, we aim to provide a more comprehensive solution to our users.\nCustomers adopting multi-channel strategies. Customers are developing multi-channel strategies beyond a single retail, correspondent, or wholesale mortgage lending channel in order to grow their businesses. The requirements of these different channels vary, and in order to maintain a single operating system, customers must use a robust system with customizable functionality. Encompass includes support for multi-channel workflows, allowing our customers to drive efficiencies and boost productivity by creating distinct workflows for each channel that map to our customers' business needs. Encompass users can customize workflows based on channel, loan purpose or specific loan criteria - all of which can vary between lending channels. With the introduction of Encompass TPO Connect, Encompass users are able to utilize a customizable and interactive web experience for wholesale and correspondent lending channels, which gives lenders and investors a modern and collaborative web experience for their TPO partners that promotes compliance, data integrity, and easy bi-directional communication throughout the entire loan process. Additionally, Encompass Consumer Connect supports our customers' retail channel by enabling our customers to originate loans directly from borrowers by offering an online loan application that can be accessed by anyone with a web browser.\nChanges in regulation affecting lenders and investors. Mortgage lending regulations continue to change and many regulatory reforms have been introduced or proposed in recent years to promote increased underwriting standards and accountability by lenders and mortgage originators, ensure meaningful disclosures by lenders to borrowers, increase the transparency and objectivity of settlement services, and protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abusive lending practices. We devote considerable resources to continually upgrade our software to help our customers address regulatory changes. We offer Encompass Compliance Service, which analyzes mortgage loan data for compliance with consumer protection laws and institutionally mandated compliance policies and also alerts users to possible violations of these laws and policies. In addition, we have a staff of attorneys who work with compliance experts and help ensure that documents prepared using our software and the processes recommended by the Encompass workflow comply with applicable rules and regulations. For example, additional tools and product updates were required to address the Ability-to-Repay/Qualified Mortgage and Federal and State High Cost rules that became effective in January 2014. In addition, we updated certain of our products to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule changes that took effect in October 2015, and are providing complete offering of readiness initiatives, tools and training programs in advance of the 2018 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C collection and reporting changes which take effect through 2020. We are also making substantial changes to our products and services to accommodate the upcoming February 2020 adoption deadline for the redesigned Uniform Residential Loan Application. We believe we are well-positioned to help our customers comply with changing regulatory requirements as they are published and become effective. However, changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the residential mortgage industry could require us to incur significant costs to update our products and services so that our customers remain compliant with such laws and regulations.\nConsumer Demand for a Digital Based Experience from Lenders. Today's borrowers expect transparency, service and speed, and a human touch. To meet these requirements, lenders must offer a seamless, online experience that continues even after the application has been submitted. It is our goal to provide a true digital mortgage process that enables the lender to originate more loans, lower origination costs, reduce the time to close and make smarter decisions through data and predictive analytics, all while ensuring the highest levels of compliance, quality and efficiency. Our digital mortgage vision encompasses all phases of the mortgage loan lifecycle, with each milestone in the mortgage origination process informing the next.\nIncreased quality standards imposed by regulators, lenders, and investors.

We have increased the size of our customer acquisition, implementation, and support teams in order to address anticipated demand for our software solutions.\nGreater focus by customers and regulators on data security and consumer privacy. Recent high-profile data security incidents affecting banking institutions and their third-party service providers have resulted in an increased focus on data security by our customers and our customers' regulators. We are making significant investments in the security of the Encompass service, as well as our internal systems, processes, and monitoring capabilities to protect our customers' data and help minimize the risk of data security loss. We expect the industry focus on data security to continue to increase, and we anticipate that our investments in data security will increase substantially over time.\n________________\n(1) Mortgage Bankers Association, IBM Profits Lag in the Third Quarter, November 29, 2018.\nIncrease the number of lenders using Encompass and the number of loans originated on our platform. In addition to addressing the industry trends discussed above, we continue to focus our marketing, sales and product development efforts on increasing the number of mortgage lenders, commercial banks and credit unions using Encompass and our additional services, and the number of loans originated on our platform. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on all market segments, including the largest, or enterprise segment, of the lending industry.\nOperating Metrics\nWe use certain operational metrics to evaluate our business, determine allocation of our resources, and make decisions regarding corporate strategy. We focus on these metrics to determine our success in leveraging our user base to increase our revenues and to gauge the degree of our market penetration.\nOur key operating metrics are defined below.\nContracted revenues.

An active user is a mortgage origination professional who has used Encompass at least once within a 90-day period preceding the measurement date. A user is a mortgage origination professional working at an Encompass mortgage lender, such as a mortgage bank, commercial bank, thrift or credit union, which sources and funds loans and generally sells these funded loans to investors; or a mortgage brokerage, which typically processes and submits loan files to a mortgage lender or mega lender that funds the loan.\nAverage active users.

In order to achieve that core principle, the following five step approach is applied:\n \u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; \n \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u2022 Determination of the transaction price; \n \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.  We generate revenues primarily from cloud-based subscription services, transaction-based fees and related services, including professional services and our annual user conference, and recognize revenues as performance obligations are satisfied. Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from transaction price.\nOur revenues are generated from subscriptions to our cloud-based Encompass platform that customers access through the Internet. Our revenues are also comprised of fees for software services sold both as a subscription and on a transactional basis, including fees based on a per closed loan, or success basis, subject to monthly base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing, as well as Ellie Mae Network fees, fees for loan product, policy and guideline data and analytics services, fees for lead management, marketing and customer relationship management, and fees for professional services which include consulting, implementation, and education and training services.\nCost of Revenues and Operating Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of revenues consists primarily of: salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation expense; data center operating costs; depreciation on data center computer equipment; amortization of internal-use software and acquired intangible assets such as developed technology; customer support; professional services associated with implementation of our software; third-party royalty expenses; and allocated facilities costs. We expect that our cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we make additional and accelerated investments to bolster our infrastructure and enhance our system capacity, reliability, and data security, as we place new internal-use software into service. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in key areas such as development of internal-use software, technical support, data security, and data center infrastructure to better support our customers and further differentiate ourselves. This includes development of our next generation Encompass platform, which we expect to continue to roll out to customers in 2019 and 2020, as well as our continuous effort to move toward a hybrid cloud architecture.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of: salaries, benefits and incentive compensation, including stock-based compensation expense and commissions; allocated facilities costs; expenses for trade shows, public relations, our annual user conference, and other promotional and marketing activities; expenses for travel and entertainment; and amortization of acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade names. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we pursue additional strategic customer acquisitions and as our annual user conference continues to increase in size.\nResearch and Development\nOur research and development expenses consist primarily of: salaries and benefits, including bonuses and stock-based compensation expense; fees to contractors engaged in the development of the Encompass software, Ellie Mae Network, and other products; and allocated facilities costs. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in our products and services, related next-generation enhancements and in our scalability efforts to expand our platform, including hiring additional engineering and product development personnel, and as we pursue additional strategic acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of: salaries and benefits, including bonuses and stock-based compensation expense for employees involved in finance, accounting, human resources, administration, information technology, and legal; third-party provider expenses such as general consulting, legal, accounting, and other professional services; and allocated facilities costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our facilities, hire additional personnel, and invest in our back-office infrastructure to enhance our system capacity, reliability, and security.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists of interest income earned on investments and cash accounts and investment premium accretion, offset by investment discount amortization, interest expense paid on equipment and software leases, and loss on the disposal of fixed assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, income taxes, stock-based compensation, goodwill and intangible assets, fair value of investments, deferred contract costs, and software and website development costs have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe apply the provisions of Topic 606 for revenue recognition on contracts with customers. Pursuant to Topic 606, we recognize revenues under the core principle to depict the transfer of control to our customers in an amount reflecting the consideration to which we expect to be entitled. In order to achieve that core principle, the following five step approach is applied:\n \u2022 Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; \n \u2022 Identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \n \u2022 Determination of the transaction price; \n \u2022 Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u2022 Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.  We generate revenues primarily from cloud-based subscription services, transaction-based fees, and related services including professional services and our annual user conference, and recognize revenues as performance obligations are satisfied. For subscription services where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit from our performance, revenues are recognized over time using an output method based on the passage of time as this provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of control. Under Encompass subscriptions that customers access through the Internet, revenues are comprised of software services sold both as a subscription and on a variable basis. Variable fees include fees billed on a per closed loan, or success basis, subject to monthly base fees, which we refer to as Success-Based Pricing. Other cloud-based subscription services consist of policy, guideline, data and analytics, lead management, marketing, and customer relationship management. Transaction-based fees are comprised of Ellie Mae Network fees and transaction fees charged for other services, including fees for loan products and the annual user conference. Fees for professional services include consulting, implementation, and education and training services. Sales taxes assessed by governmental authorities are excluded from the transaction price.\nIn contracts where recognizing variable consideration in the month it is earned does not meet the allocation objective of Topic 606, variable consideration is estimated and included in the transaction price. We estimate such amounts at contract inception considering historical trends, industry data, and contract specific factors to determine an expected amount to which we expect to be entitled. Estimates are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is considered probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The assessment of whether such an estimate is constrained requires us to consider methods, inputs, and assumptions relating to the nature of the underlying products, customer-specific trends, and economic factors including industry data. Other forms of variable consideration such as refunds and penalties, which are recorded in accrued and other current liabilities, are estimated at contract inception and are allocated to the performance obligations to which they relate.\nWe enter into arrangements that generally include multiple subscriptions and professional services. For arrangements with multiple services, we evaluate whether the individual services qualify as distinct performance obligations. In our assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, we determine whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources and whether the service is separately identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires that we assess the nature of each individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services are significantly integrated, highly interrelated, or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the contract.\nWhen agreements involve multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate arrangement consideration to all performance obligations at the inception of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices of each performance obligation. Where we have standalone sales data for performance obligations which are indicative of the price at which we sell a promised good or service separately to a customer, such data is used to establish standalone selling prices. In instances where standalone sales data is not available for a particular performance obligation, we estimate standalone selling prices by maximizing the use of observable market and cost-based inputs.\nWhen estimating standalone selling prices, we review company-specific factors used to determine list price and make adjustments as appropriate to reflect current market conditions and pricing behavior. Our process for establishing list price includes assessing the cost to provide a particular product or service, surveying customers to determine market expectations, analyzing customer demographics, and taking into account our similar products and services historically sold. We continue to review the factors used to establish list price and will adjust standalone selling price methodologies as necessary on a prospective basis.\nCloud-Based Subscription Revenues. Cloud-based subscription revenues generally include a combination of our products delivered as SaaS subscriptions that are a performance obligation consisting of a series of distinct services and support services. These arrangements are generally non-cancelable and do not contain refund-type provisions. These revenues typically include the following:\nEncompass Revenues. We offer web-based, on-demand access to our cloud-based Encompass platform which has been determined to be a stand-ready obligation. Revenues are recognized over the contract terms as performance obligations are satisfied as this method best depicts the pattern of performance for such services. Contracts generally range from one year to five years.\nSome Encompass customers elect to pay on a success basis. Success basis contracts are subject to monthly billing calculations whereby customers are obligated to pay the greater of a contractual base fee or variable closed loan fee based on the number of closed loan transactions processed by the customer in the specific month. Under success basis contracts, monthly base fees are recognized ratably over the contract terms as subscription performance obligations are satisfied and closed loan fees in excess of base fees are considered variable consideration.\nFor the majority of Encompass contracts that include variable consideration, such fees are recognized in the month in which they are earned because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the outcome from transferring the distinct time increment (month) of service and because such amounts reflect the fees to which we expect to be entitled for providing access to the Encompass platform for that period, consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606.\nFor certain contracts where the allocation objective would not be met by allocating variable consideration in this way, total variable consideration to be received is estimated at contract inception and recognized ratably over the contract term. The estimates of the total variable consideration expected to be received under such agreements is updated at each reporting date. For these contracts, variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method, utilizing forecast data for each contract to determine the expected value.\nWe evaluate our ability to accurately estimate such variable consideration considering all relevant facts and circumstances associated with both the likelihood of a downward adjustment in the estimate of variable consideration and the potential magnitude of a significant revenue reversal relative to the cumulative revenue recognized to-date under the contract. Because the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to broad economic factors outside our influence, have a broad range of possible consideration amounts, and the uncertainty"}
