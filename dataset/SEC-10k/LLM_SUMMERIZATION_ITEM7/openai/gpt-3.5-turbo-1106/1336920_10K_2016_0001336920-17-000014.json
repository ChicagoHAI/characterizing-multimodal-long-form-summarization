Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s (\"Leidos\") financial condition, results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nUnless indicated otherwise, references in this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAll amounts in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" are presented for our continuing operations.\nOn March 20, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement of our bylaws to change Leidos' year end from the Friday nearest the end of January to the Friday nearest the end of December. As a result of this change, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 11-month period which began on January 31, 2015, and ended on January 1, 2016. This change did not impact our prior reported fiscal years, which covered a 12-month period and ended on the Friday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015 began on February 1, 2014, and ended on January 30, 2015. This Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 covers a 12-month period that began on January 2, 2016, and ended on December 30, 2016.\nThe information presented in the Results of Operations compares fiscal 2016 (January 2, 2016 - December 30, 2016) to the 11-month transition period ended January 1, 2016 (January 31, 2015 - January 1, 2016) and compares the 11-month transition period ended January 1, 2016, to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015 (February 1, 2014 - January 2, 2015). As a result, fiscal 2016 includes an additional month of activity as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, which is a factor in the year-over-year changes discussed.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our intent, belief, or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, backlog, our industry, government budgets and spending, the impact of competition, and the performance and carrying value of our assets. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. See Risk Factors-Forward-Looking Statement Risks\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Risk Factors.\u201d Due to such uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to update these factors or to publicly announce the results of any changes to our forward-looking statements due to future events or developments.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 37\nPART II\nOverview\nWe are a global science and technology company that provides technology and engineering services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities: command, control, computing, communications and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (\"C4ISR\"); cybersecurity; systems engineering; large-scale agile software development; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; and operations and sustainment. Our domestic customers include agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), the Department of Health and Human Services, other U.S. Government civil agencies and state and local government agencies. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Australia. The majority of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located in the United States.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we completed our acquisition of Lockheed Martin's IS&GS Business (see \"Note 2-Acquisitions\"). Our fiscal 2016 results include the results of the IS&GS Business for the period from August 16, 2016, to December 30, 2016. The acquired IS&GS Business was identified as a new operating and reportable segment (see \"Note 19-Business Segments\"). In fiscal 2016, we sold our design, build and heavy construction business. Consequently, the reportable segment of Health and Engineering was renamed as Health and Infrastructure (see \"Note 3-Divestitures\" and \"Note 19-Business Segments\"). We now operate in the following segments: National Security Solutions (\"NSS\"), Information Systems & Global Solutions (\"IS&GS\"), Health and Infrastructure (\"HIS\") and Corporate and Other.\nFor additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Business\u201d in Part I and \"Note 19-Business Segments\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur significant initiatives include the following:\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>achieving internal, or non-acquisition related, annual revenue growth through internal collaboration and better leveraging of key differentiators across our company and the deployment of resources and investments into higher growth markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increasing the growth of our operating profits through improving the quality of our revenues and contract profitability, continued improvement in our IT systems infrastructure and related business processes for greater effectiveness and efficiency across all business functions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>disciplined deployment of our cash resources and use of our capital structure to enhance shareholder value while retaining an appropriate amount of financial leverage, through internal growth initiatives, stock repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, debt level management and other uses to achieve our goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Sales Trend. For fiscal 2016, revenues increased by $2.3 billion, or 49%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily attributable to revenues within our IS&GS segment. The revenue increase is also due to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, revenues increased by $22 million, or less than 1%, to $4.7 billion compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015, primarily due to growth in our engineering construction business as well as recent awards in our federal health business and for an international logistics program. This increase was partially offset by a decline in contract activities associated with support of Overseas Contingency Operations (\"OCO Contracts\") and continued decline in our commercial health business. See \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of our segment results.\nOperating Expenses and Income Trend. For fiscal 2016, operating expenses increased by $2.2 billion, or 51%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily attributable to the new IS&GS segment. Operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 5.9% compared to 6.8% for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred during fiscal 2016 related to the acquisition of the IS&GS Business. For fiscal 2016, our operating income was $417 million, a $97 million increase compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the newly acquired IS&GS Business.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 38\nPART II\nFor the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, operating expenses decreased by $489 million, or 10%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. Operating expenses decreased at a greater rate than revenues, resulting in an operating income margin of 6.8% for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, compared to a negative operating margin of 4.1% for the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, our operating income was $320 million, a $511 million increase compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. This increase in operating margin and income was primarily due to prior period goodwill and asset impairment charges and increased program margins coupled with improved product mix of higher margin security product sales. See \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of our segment results.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, our industry is under general competitive pressures due to spending from our largest customer, the U.S. Government, and has required and will require a higher level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive. Although the new Administration and Congress would like to significantly increase spending, primarily in the defense and homeland security sectors, it remains unclear whether or not they will be able to move such legislation through the Senate. We continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary.\nLockheed Martin Transaction\nOn January 26, 2016, Leidos announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the \"Merger Agreement\") with Lockheed Martin Corporation (\"Lockheed Martin\"); Abacus Innovations Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (\"Splitco\"); and Lion Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and, at the time of announcement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Leidos would combine with Lockheed Martin's realigned Information Systems & Global Solutions business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Lockheed Martin and Splitco entered into a Separation Agreement dated January 26, 2016 (as amended, the \"Separation Agreement\"), pursuant to which Lockheed Martin would separate the IS&GS Business from Lockheed Martin and transfer the IS&GS Business to Splitco. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement are referred to herein as the Transactions.\u201d\nOn August 16, 2016, the acquisition date, we completed the Transactions. In the Transactions, among other steps, (i) Lockheed Martin transferred the IS&GS Business to Splitco; (ii) Lockheed Martin offered to Lockheed Martin stockholders the right to exchange all or a portion of their shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Splitco common stock by way of an exchange offer (the \"Distribution\"); and (iii) Merger Sub merged with and into Splitco, with Splitco as the surviving corporation (the \"Merger\") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos. Additionally, on the closing date of the Transactions, Splitco's name was changed to Leidos Innovations Corporation. Upon consummation of the Transactions, those Lockheed Martin stockholders who elected to participate in the exchange offer received approximately 77 million shares of Leidos common stock, which represent approximately 50.5% of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock after consummation of the Transactions. Holders of Leidos shares prior to the transaction held the remaining 49.5% of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock immediately after the closing.\nPrior to the Distribution, Splitco incurred third-party debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion and immediately thereafter, Lockheed Martin transferred the IS&GS Business to Splitco and Splitco made a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin of $1.8 billion.\nIn connection with the Transactions, Leidos incurred new indebtedness and assumed Splitco's indebtedness in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $690 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, and entered into a new $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which replaced its existing revolving credit facility. See \"Note 11-Debt\" for further information regarding the new debt incurred and the new senior revolving credit facility.\nIn conjunction with the Transactions, Leidos' Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $13.64 per share of Leidos common stock. Consequently, on August 22, 2016, we paid $993 million to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016, and accrued $29 million of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding unvested equity awards. See \"Note 14-Stock Based Compensation\" for further information regarding the modifications made to our outstanding stock awards as a result of the special dividend.\nWe incurred $46 million of integration costs during fiscal 2016 and expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the Transactions through fiscal 2018.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 39\nPART II\nIn connection with the Transactions, certain additional agreements were entered into, including, among others an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, transition services agreements, an intellectual property matters agreement, agreements relating to certain government contracts matters, supply agreements and certain real estate related agreements.\nSpin-off Transaction\nIn accordance with a distribution agreement, on September 27, 2013 (the \"Distribution Date\"), Leidos completed a spin-off of its technical services and enterprise information technology services business into an independent, publicly traded company named Science Application International Corporation (\"New SAIC\"). The spin-off was effected through a tax-free distribution to Leidos' stockholders of 100% of the shares of New SAIC's common stock. As a result of the spin-off, the results of operations and cash flows of New SAIC have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nDivestitures\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn addition to the spin-off of New SAIC discussed above, in order to better align our business portfolio with our strategy, we sold or committed to plans to dispose of certain non-strategic components of our business in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which are reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nIn August 2014, we sold a business, historically included in our Health and Infrastructure segment, which primarily focused on full service emergency management consulting for disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation, for cash proceeds of $19 million, resulting in an immaterial gain on sale.\nIn January 2014, we committed to plans to dispose of Cloudshield Technologies, Inc. (\"Cloudshield\"), historically included in our National Security Solutions segment, which was previously acquired in fiscal 2011 and primarily focused on producing a suite of cybersecurity hardware and associated software and services. The sale transaction was completed in February 2015 with received cash proceeds of $5 million, resulting in an immaterial loss on sale.\nIn August 2013, we committed to plans to dispose of a business, historically included in our National Security Solutions segment, that primarily focused on technology used to detect if an individual is concealing explosive devices or other hidden weapons. In the first quarter ended May 2, 2014, we adjusted the carrying values of the business's assets to their fair value based on the estimated selling price of the business. The carrying value exceeded the fair value which resulted in $12 million of impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations, of which $9 million related to fixed assets and inventory and the remainder related to intangible assets. The sale transaction was completed in May 2014 with insignificant cash proceeds received, resulting in an immaterial loss on sale.\nThe operating results through the date of disposal of our discontinued operations discussed above for the periods presented were as follows: Table 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12 Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11 Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12 Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses (including impairment charges of $9 million for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2015)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 40\nPART II\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nU.S. Government Markets\nFor fiscal 2016, we generated approximately 81% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. Government. Revenues under contracts with the DoD, including subcontracts under which the DoD is the ultimate purchaser, represented approximately 56% of our total revenues for fiscal 2016. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. Government spending, especially national security, homeland security, and intelligence spending, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. Government.\nIn February 2016, the President delivered his requested budget for the government fiscal year (\"GFY\") 2017 budget cycle to Congress. The Appropriations Committee began its work for the year in March 2016 and made significant progress in committee. However, Congress failed to enact any of the 12 appropriations bills, which necessitated the passage of a series of continuing resolutions (\"CR\"). The federal government continues to operate under a CR which expires on April 28, 2017. There is a possibility of a government shutdown if Congress cannot agree to a long-term budget agreement; however, we believe that is unlikely. Furthermore, we expect the new Administration to submit a GFY 2018 budget later in the spring and, although Congress and the Administration are controlled by the same political party, there are no guarantees that any of the 12 appropriations bills will be enacted by the end of this government fiscal year.\nTrends in the U.S. Government contracting process, including a shift towards multiple-awards contracts (in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ\") and U.S. General Services Administration (\"GSA\") contract vehicles) and awarding contracts on a low price, technically acceptable basis, have increased competition for U.S. Government contracts, reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts, and increased pricing pressure. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInternational Markets\nSales to customers in international markets represented 9% of total revenues for fiscal 2016 compared to 4% of total revenues for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of the IS&GS Business. The acquisition has increased the relative contribution from international business, particularly in the United Kingdom and Australia, and has therefore increased our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks.\nKey Performance Measures\nThe primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted EPS. We also believe that bookings and backlog are useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues. In addition, we consider contract types to be a useful measure to management and investors in evaluating our operating income and margin performance.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 41\nPART II\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2016, the 11-month periods ended January 1, 2016, and January 2, 2015, and

The revenue increase was primarily attributable to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. These increases were partially offset by reduced revenue due to lower scope and completion of certain contracts.\nIn constant currency, revenues increased 13% for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The adverse impact of foreign currency of 1% was primarily due to the movement of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound.\nNational Security Solutions revenues decreased $127 million, or 4%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. The revenue contraction was primarily attributable to contract activities associated with OCO Contracts which includes a reduction of airborne programs that support intelligence collection. Excluding the revenue declines associated with OCO Contracts, the remaining revenue for the National Securities Solutions segment increased by 2% primarily due to an increase in our logistics program. OCO Contracts contributed approximately $175 million in revenues for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016.\nNational Security Solutions operating income increased $29 million, or 11%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. This increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased revenues.\nNational Security Solutions operating income decreased $7 million, or 3%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. This decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues.\n(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

The revenue decline is primarily attributable to the divestiture of our design, build and heavy construction engineering services business in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and the sale of the Plainfield plant, which closed in the second quarter of the prior year, as well as lower revenues in our engineering services business. This was partially offset by growth in the federal and commercial health businesses. Excluding the revenues from the divested businesses, HIS revenues increased $232 million, or 18.9%, primarily due to growth in the federal and commercial health businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in our engineering services business.\nHealth and Infrastructure revenues increased $130 million, or 10%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. The revenue growth reflects increased revenues in our engineering construction business, higher sales in the Federal Health business primarily due to our new Electronic Health Record system modernization program, and timing of security product shipments, which was partially offset by decreased volume in the commercial health business.\nHealth and Infrastructure operating income was $162 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to operating income of $76 million for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to $46 million of asset impairment charges and operating losses associated mainly with the Plainfield plant recorded in the prior year that did not recur in fiscal 2016, along with a decrease in bad debt expense.\nHealth and Infrastructure operating income was $76 million for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to operating loss of $442 million for the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. The increase in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in asset impairment charges in our commercial health and engineering businesses, primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge during fiscal 2015 of $486 million as well as higher operating income generated from our security products business due to an impairment charge in fiscal 2015 on our Reveal line of security products, increased volume of higher margin security products and lower indirect costs. The increase in operating income was partially offset by bad debt expense associated with a renewable energy power generation facility design build project that was completed in 2013.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

The increase in operating loss was also attributable to a $12 million unfavorable change in real estate activity, a $6 million loss recognized on our defined benefit pension plan and proceeds received during the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, related to the settlement of a litigation matter of $5 million.\nCorporate and Other operating loss was approximately $19 million for both the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015, respectively.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Evaluations\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, our Health Solutions and Infrastructure reporting units within the Health and Infrastructure reportable segment were adversely impacted by certain unexpected events that caused us to reassess that year and future years' performance expectations for both reporting units. Based on significant declines in forecasted revenue volumes and delayed award decisions, we conducted an interim goodwill impairment test using the two-step quantitative approach.\nBased on the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test performed during the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we determined that the carrying value of both the Health Solutions and Infrastructure reporting units were greater than the respective estimated fair values of the reporting units, and the second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test was performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment of the respective reporting units.\nAs a result of the second step evaluation, we recorded goodwill impairment charges in the Health Solutions and Infrastructure reporting units of $369 million and $117 million, respectively, during the second quarter of fiscal 2015. There were no other goodwill impairment charges as part of the interim goodwill impairment test recorded for the remaining reporting units. See \"Note 5-Goodwill\" within our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 45\nPART II\nAsset Impairment\nIn March 2015, we entered into a definitive Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the \"Agreement\") to sell 100% of our equity membership interest in Plainfield Renewable Energy Holdings, LLC (\"Plainfield\"). We adjusted the carrying values of Plainfield's assets to their fair values based on the estimated selling price of the business pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The carrying value exceeded the fair value, which resulted in approximately $40 million of impairment charges in fiscal 2015. In the second quarter of the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, further negotiations occurred related to the sale of Plainfield resulting in approximately $29 million of impairment charges. We adjusted the carrying values of Plainfield's assets to their fair values based on the estimated selling price of the business pursuant to the terms of the amended Agreement that was amended on July 17, 2015. On July 24, 2015, we completed the sale. See \"Note 3-Divestitures\" within our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the sale.\nRestructuring Expenses\nAfter the acquisition of the IS&GS Business, we began an initiative to review our cost structure, which included optimization of our real estate portfolio by vacating facilities that were not necessary for future requirements, and reducing headcount. For fiscal 2016, we recognized $12 million of restructuring expenses related to this program. We anticipate this restructuring program to last through fiscal 2018 and currently expect to incur approximately $125 million in connection with these restructuring activities.\nFor fiscal 2016, the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015, we recorded $2 million, $4 million and $3 million of restructuring expenses, respectively, related to the separation of New SAIC and our real estate optimization initiatives. Substantially all of these charges resulted from a revision of original estimates for vacating real estate leases.\nEquity earnings of non-consolidated subsidiaries\nAs a result of the Lockheed Martin transaction, we received certain non-controlling ownership interests in equity investments. For fiscal 2016, we recorded earnings of $10 million from our equity method investments.\nNon-Operating (Expense) Income\nNon-operating expense for fiscal 2016 was $99 million as compared to non-operating income of $35 million for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by the tax deductibility of the special cash dividend, related to the Transactions on shares held by the Leidos retirement plan, the income tax benefits of the research tax credit and the excess tax benefits related to employee share-based payments, partially offset by the impact of certain capitalized transactions costs related to the Transactions.\nThe effective tax rate for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, was favorably impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward for capital gains recognized during the current year as well as the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies with the tax authorities. The effective tax rate for the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015, was negatively impacted by the goodwill impairment charge of $486 million recorded in the quarter ended August 1, 2014, which was mostly not deductible.\nOur valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was $102 million as of December 30, 2016, and January 1, 2016.\nNon-controlling Interest\nAs a result of the Lockheed Martin transaction, we received an interest in Mission Support Alliance, LLC (\"MSA\"), a joint venture with Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. and Centerra Group, LLC. We have consolidated the financial results for MSA into our consolidated financial statements. Net income attributable to non-controlling interest, for fiscal 2016 was $2 million.\nBookings and Backlog\nWe had net bookings worth an estimated $6.9 billion and $6.8 billion during fiscal 2016 and the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, respectively. Net bookings represent the estimated amount of revenue to be earned in the future from funded and unfunded contract awards that were received during the year, net of any adjustments to previously awarded backlog amounts. We calculate net bookings as the year's ending backlog plus the year's revenues less the prior year's ending backlog and less the backlog obtained in acquisitions during the year.\nBacklog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. We segregate our backlog into two categories as follows:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Funded Backlog. Funded backlog for contracts with government agencies primarily represents contracts for which funding is appropriated less revenues previously recognized on these contracts, and does not include the unfunded portion of contracts where funding is incrementally appropriated or authorized on a quarterly or annual basis by the U.S. Government and other customers, even though the contract may call for performance over a number of years. Funded backlog for contracts with non-government agencies and commercial customers represents the estimated value on contracts, which may cover multiple future years, under which we are obligated to perform, less revenues previously recognized on these contracts.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Negotiated Unfunded Backlog. Negotiated unfunded backlog represents estimated amounts of revenue to be earned in the future from (1) negotiated contracts for which funding has not been appropriated or otherwise authorized and (2) unexercised priced contract options. Negotiated unfunded backlog does not include future potential task orders expected to be awarded under IDIQ, GSA Schedule, or other master agreement contract vehicles.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

Contract awards may be negatively impacted by ongoing industry-wide delays in procurement decisions and budget cuts by the U.S. Government as discussed in Business Environment and Trends\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. Government may cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. Government. In addition, certain contracts with commercial or non-U.S. Federal Government customers may include provisions that allow the customer to cancel at any time. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 48\nPART II\nContract Types\nOur earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract. For a discussion of the types of contracts under which we generate revenue, see Business-Contract Types\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The percentage of revenue derived from T&M and FP-LOE contracts decreased by 3% and FFP contracts increased by 3% for fiscal 2016 from the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily due to the contract mix of the acquired IS&GS Business.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview of Liquidity\nAs of December 30, 2016, we had $376 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, in August 2016, we entered into a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to $750 million in secured borrowing capacity, if required. This new credit facility replaced the previous unsecured credit facility held that provided $500 million of borrowing capacity. During fiscal 2016 and the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either of the credit facilities and we were in compliance with the financial covenants.\nIn August 2016, our Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $13.64 per share of Leidos common stock. Consequently, on August 22, 2016, we paid $993 million to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016, and accrued $29 million of dividend equivalents with respect to the outstanding unvested equity awards. In addition, we paid quarterly dividends of $142 million, $93 million and $95 million for fiscal 2016, the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively.\nAt December 30, 2016, and January 1, 2016, we had outstanding debt of $3.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. The notes outstanding as of December 30, 2016, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 30, 2016.\nIn connection with the Transactions, Leidos has incurred $2.5 billion of new indebtedness in the form of term loans (see \"Note 2-Acquisitions\"). Of the $2.5 billion, $1.8 billion of the term loans was secured by Leidos Innovations prior to being acquired and the funds were used to finance the special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The remaining $690 million of term loans was secured by Leidos to fund the special cash dividend. During fiscal 2016, we repaid $275 million of these term loans (see \"Note 11-Debt\").\nIn August 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the cash flows with respect to $1.2 billion of the aggregate principal outstanding on the Company's variable rate senior secured notes (see \"Note 10-Derivative Instruments\"). The objective of these instruments is to reduce variability in the forecasted interest payments of the Company's variable rate secured notes.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. In addition to the $275 million repaid in fiscal 2016 noted above, we paid $36 million and $175 million in the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015, respectively, to repurchase and retire a principal amount of $37 million and $183 million of outstanding debt, respectively.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 49\nPART II\nStock repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions with third parties including through accelerated share repurchase agreements. Whether repurchases are made and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depends on a variety of factors including price, corporate capital requirements, other market conditions and regulatory requirements. The repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2016, there were no open market repurchases of our common stock.\nIn the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (\"ASR\") agreement with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100 million, resulting in a delivery of 2.4 million shares, completed during the second quarter of the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016.\nIn fiscal 2015, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $200 million, resulting in a delivery of 5.3 million shares, completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2015.\nIn fiscal 2014, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $300 million. The final delivery of approximately 1.0 million shares for a total value of $45 million under the program was completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\nWe anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility.\nSummary of Cash Flows\nThe following table summarizes cash flow information for fiscal 2016, the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015: Table 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12 Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11 Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12 Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in financing activities of continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(751\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(249\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(478\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by operating activities of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash (used in) provided by investing activities of discontinued operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(280\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Provided by Operating Activities of Continuing Operations. Cash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased $47 million for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The increase was primarily due to timing of collections of receivables and early funding for employee benefit programs of $30 million in the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016 that did not recur in fiscal 2016, partially offset by payments for acquisition and integration expenses, pre-funding IS&GS expenses in accordance with the transition services agreement with Lockheed Martin and increased interest payments in fiscal 2016.\nCash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations increased $3 million for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to a net increase in working capital of $117 million, partially offset by a decrease in net income adjusted for non-cash items of $78 million. The net increase in working capital was primarily due to lower tax payments and a net increase from the timing of collections from customers and payments to vendors. Cash flows provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the advancement of funding for employee benefit programs of $30 million.\nCash flows provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $11 million in the month of January 2015, consisting of net income adjusted for non cash items of $39 million partially offset by a net decrease in working capital of $24 million.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 50\nPART II\nCash Provided by Investing Activities of Continuing Operations. We generated $26 million of cash flows from investing activities for fiscal 2016, including cash acquired as part of the acquisition of the IS&GS Business of $25 million and proceeds from the divestiture of our design, build and heavy construction engineering services business of $23 million, partially offset by $29 million of payments for capital expenditures.\nWe generated $64 million of cash flows from investing activities of continuing operations for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, including $79 million of proceeds from the sale of assets, primarily due to the sale of the remaining building, parcels of land and the multi-level surface parking garage of our former headquarters of $70 million, as well as $27 million received from the disposition of our equity interest in Plainfield. This increase is partially offset by $27 million to purchase property, plant, and equipment and $13 million paid for income tax related matters in connection with a prior acquisition. We did not have cash flows from investing activities for the month of January 2015.\nWe generated $51 million of cash flows from investing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2015, including $80 million of proceeds from the U.S. Treasury cash grant in connection with the Plainfield plant, offset by $29 million to purchase property, plant, and equipment.\nCash Used in Financing Activities of Continuing Operations. We used $751 million of cash in support of financing activities of continuing operations for fiscal 2016, primarily due to a special cash dividend payment in connection with the Transactions of $993 million and dividend payments of $142 million, partially offset by net borrowings of $385 million.\nWe used $249 million of cash in support of financing activities of continuing operations for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily due to the repayment and retirement of debt of $36 million, the payment of dividends of $93 million and $100 million to repurchase shares of our stock related to the May 2015 ASR.\nWe used $47 million of cash in support of financing activities of continuing operations for the month of January 2015, including the repayment and retirement of debt of $23 million and the payment of dividends of $24 million.\nWe used $478 million of cash in support of financing activities of continuing operations in fiscal 2015, including the repurchase and retirement of debt of $175 million, the payment of dividends of $95 million and $200 million to repurchase shares of our stock from the fiscal 2015 ASR, partially offset by $7 million in proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") and exercise of stock options.\nCash Flows from Discontinued Operations\nCash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities of Discontinued Operations. There were no cash flows provided by operating activities of discontinued operations for fiscal 2016. Cash flows provided by operating activities of discontinued operations decreased $22 million for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to a decrease of net income adjusted for non-cash items of $12 million and a decrease in working capital of $8 million. Cash flows provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $20 million in the month of January 2015, primarily due to a tax benefit of $18 million from the conversion of one of our domestic subsidiaries held in discontinued operations.\nCash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities of Discontinued Operations. Cash flows provided by investing activities of discontinued operations were $1 million for fiscal 2016. Cash flows provided by investing activities of discontinued operations were $6 million for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, due to cash proceeds received primarily for the sale of a component of our business focused on producing a suite of cybersecurity hardware and associated software and services completed in February 2015. There were no cash flows from investing activities of discontinued operations in the month of January 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities of discontinued operations were $29 million for fiscal 2015 due to cash proceeds received for the sale of certain components of our business in fiscal 2015.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

Annual Report - 52\nPART II\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates and assumptions have been prepared by management on the basis of the most current reasonably available information. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nWe have several critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Typically, the circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and complex have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our critical accounting policies are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate our revenues from various types of contracts, which include firm-fixed-price, time-and-materials, fixed-price-level-of-effort, cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee and fixed-price-incentive fee contracts.\nFirm-fixed-price contracts-Revenues and fees on these contracts that are system integration or engineering in nature are primarily recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting utilizing the cost-to-cost method. The completed contract method is utilized when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made.\nTime-and-materials contracts-Revenue is recognized on time-and-materials contracts based on the hours provided in performance under the contract multiplied by the negotiated contract billing rates, plus the negotiated contract billing rate of any allowable material and subcontract costs and out-of-pocket expenses.\nFixed-price-level-of-effort contracts (\"FP-LOE\")-These contracts are substantially similar to time-and-materials contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time. Accordingly, we recognize revenue on FP-LOE contracts with the U.S. Government in a manner similar to time-and-materials contracts in which we measure progress toward completion based on the hours provided in performance under the contract multiplied by the negotiated contract billing rates plus the negotiated contract billing rate of any allowable material costs and out-of-pocket expenses.\nCost-plus-fixed-fee contracts-Revenue is recognized on cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts with the U.S. Government on the basis of partial performance equal to costs incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned as we become contractually entitled to reimbursement of costs and the applicable fees.\nCost-plus-award-fee/cost-plus-incentive fee contracts-Revenues and fees on these contracts with the U.S. Government are primarily recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting most often based on the cost-to-cost method. We include an estimate of the ultimate incentive or award fee to be received on the contract in the estimate of contract revenues for purposes of applying the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.\nFixed-price-incentive fee ( FP-IF\u201d) contracts-Contracts are substantially similar to cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting except they require specified targets for cost and profit, price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor) and profit adjustment formula. Under an FP-IF contract, the allowable costs incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to a cost-share arrangement, which affects profitability. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 53\nPART II\nRevenues from services and maintenance contracts, notwithstanding contract type, are recognized over the term of the respective contracts as the services are performed and revenue is earned. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output. Revenues from the sale of manufactured products are recorded upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer, which is generally upon delivery, provided that all other requirements for revenue recognition have been met.\nWe also use the efforts-expended method of percentage-of-completion using measures such as labor dollars for measuring progress toward completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract. For example, the efforts-expended method is utilized when there are significant amounts of materials or hardware procured for the contract that is not representative of progress on the contract. Additionally, we utilize the units-of-delivery method under percentage-of-completion on contracts where separate units of output are produced. Under the units-of-delivery method, revenue is generally recognized when the units are delivered to the customer, provided that all other requirements for revenue recognition have been met.\nWe also evaluate contracts for multiple elements, and when appropriate, separate the contracts into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition. Revenues generated from product sales do not represent a material amount of the Company's total revenues.\nWe provide for anticipated losses on contracts by recording an expense during the period in which the losses are determined. Amounts billed and collected but not yet recognized as revenues under contracts are deferred. Contract costs incurred for U.S. Government contracts, including indirect costs, are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between us and government representatives. Our indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2012 and subsequent fiscal years for Leidos, Inc. and for fiscal 2009 and subsequent fiscal years for Leidos Innovations Corporation. Revenues on U.S. Government contracts have been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final settlement.\nContract claims are unanticipated additional costs incurred but not provided for in the executed contract price that we seek to recover from the customer. Such costs are expensed as incurred. Additional revenue related to contract claims is recognized when the amounts are awarded by the customer. Un-priced change orders are included in revenue when they are probable of recovery in an amount at least equal to the cost.\nIn certain situations, primarily where we are not the primary obligor on certain elements of a contract such as the provision of administrative oversight and/or management of government-owned facilities or logistical support services related to other vendor's products, we recognize as revenues the net management fee associated with the services and exclude from our income statement the gross sales and costs associated with the facility or other vendor's products.\nChanges in Estimates on Contracts\nChanges in estimates related to contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting are recognized in the period in which such changes are made for the inception-to-date effect of the changes, with the exception of IS&GS contracts where the adjustment is for the period commencing from the date of acquisition. Changes in these estimates can routinely occur over the contract performance period for a variety of reasons, including changes in contract scope, contract cost estimates and estimated incentive or award fees.\nChanges in estimates on contracts for fiscal 2016, the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015 were as follows:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12 Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11 Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12 Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 1,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in millions, except for per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net favorable impact to income (loss) from continuing operations before taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to Leidos common stockholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 54\nPART II\nReceivables\nOur accounts receivable include amounts billed and currently due from customers. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, the amounts billable within the next month were classified as billed receivables. Such receivables were classified as unbilled receivables for fiscal 2016. Since our receivables are primarily with the U.S. Government, we do not have exposure to a material credit risk. Unbilled receivables consist of amounts billable and contract retentions. Amounts billable are stated at estimated realizable value and consist of costs and fees, substantially all of which are expected to be billed and collected within one year. Amounts billable also include rate variances that are billable upon negotiation of final indirect rates with the U.S. Government and, once billed, are subject to audit and approval by government representatives. Contract retentions are billed upon contract completion, or the occurrence of a specified event, and when negotiation of final indirect rates with the U.S. Government is complete. Consequently, the timing of collection of retention balances is outside our control. Based on our historical experience, the majority of retention balances are expected to be collected beyond one year and write-offs of retention balances have not been significant. When events or conditions indicate that amounts outstanding from customers may become uncollectible, an allowance is estimated and recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe accounting for business combinations requires management to make judgments and estimates of the fair value of assets acquired, including the identification and valuation of intangible assets, as well as the liabilities and contingencies assumed. Such judgments and estimates directly impact the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with each acquisition.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill represents purchase consideration paid in a business combination that exceeds the fair values of the net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, on the first day of the fourth quarter, and during interim periods, if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nOur policy is to perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.\nThe change in our fiscal year-end from the Friday nearest the end of January to the Friday nearest the end of December resulted in an annual goodwill impairment test date for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, that was approximately one month earlier than in previous years. The change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date was deemed to be a change in accounting principle, which we believe to be preferable. The change was made to better align with our most significant customer's fiscal year as well as our year-end reporting cycle and annual planning and budgeting process, which is a significant element in the annual goodwill impairment test. This change in accounting principle did not delay, accelerate or avoid a goodwill impairment charge. The annual goodwill impairment test was performed on November 1, 2014, for fiscal 2015, and on October 3, 2015, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, such that a period greater than 12 months did not elapse between test dates. The change in the annual goodwill impairment testing date was applied prospectively beginning on October 3, 2015, and had no effect on the consolidated financial statements. This change was not applied retrospectively as it is impracticable to objectively determine valuation estimates in prior periods.\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment either under a qualitative assessment option or a two-step quantitative approach depending on the facts and circumstances of a reporting unit, including consideration of the excess of fair value over carrying amount in previous assessments and changes in business environment.\nWhen performing a qualitative assessment, we consider factors including, but not limited to, current macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance and other events relevant to the entity or reporting unit under evaluation to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is performed.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 55\nPART II\nIn evaluating the first step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value, which includes the allocated goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying value, no further analysis is required. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit's identifiable assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value calculated in the first step. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment charge equal to the difference.\nWe estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using both market and income approaches when a quantitative analysis is performed.\nThe market approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on fair values of publicly-traded companies that provide a reasonable basis of comparison with the reporting unit. Valuation ratios are selected that relate market prices to selected financial metrics from comparable companies. These ratios are applied after consideration of adjustments and weightings related to financial position, growth, volatility, working capital movement, and other factors. Due to the fact that stock prices of comparable companies represent minority interests we also consider an acquisition control premium to reflect the impact of additional value associated with a controlling interest.\nThe income approach is a technique where the fair value is calculated based on present value future cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates, which represent the weighted-average cost of capital (\"WACC\") for each reporting unit. Determination of WACC includes assessing the cost of equity and debt as of the valuation date. In addition, a terminal value is developed for forecasted future cash flows beyond the projection period discounted back to the present value. The forecasts used in our estimation of fair value are developed by management based on business and market considerations.\nThe goodwill impairment test process and valuation model is based upon certain key assumptions that require the exercise of significant judgment including judgments for the use of appropriate financial projections, economic expectations, discount rates and WACC as well as using available market data. The goodwill impairment test process also requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions, including revenue, profit, expected long-term growth rates and cash flow forecasts about the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned. The fair values of our reporting units are based on estimates and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. Significant changes to these estimates and assumptions could adversely impact our conclusions and actual future results may differ from the estimates. In addition, the identification of reporting units and the allocation of assets and liabilities to the reporting units when determining the carrying value of each reporting unit also requires judgment.\nOur annual goodwill impairment analysis for fiscal 2016, which excluded the recently acquired IS&GS Business, indicated the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.\nWe face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the U.S. Government, our primary customer, as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry, compounded by lower levels of U.S. Government reimbursements, including reductions in Medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital IT spending. Adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability. These circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or other intangibles. Also adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or other intangibles.\nIntangible Assets Impairment\nIntangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Additionally, other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not being amortized until such time that the useful life is determined to no longer be indefinite.\nIn the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, and fiscal 2015, we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of $4 million and $41 million, respectively. There were no intangible asset impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2016. The carrying value of intangible assets as of December 30, 2016, was $1.6 billion, which included the preliminary fair value of intangible assets acquired.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 56\nPART II\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Under this method, changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in income in the period such changes are enacted. The provision for federal, state, foreign and local income taxes is calculated on income before income taxes based on current tax law and includes the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provision differs from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different reporting periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes.\nRecording our provision for income taxes requires management to make significant judgments and estimates for matters whose ultimate resolution may not become known until the final resolution of an examination by the IRS or state agencies. Additionally, recording liabilities for uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in evaluating our tax positions and developing our best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid.\nWe record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. If we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount or would no longer be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future as currently recorded, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would decrease or increase the provision for income taxes.\nWe also recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that a tax position will not be sustained upon examination and settlement with various taxing authorities. Liabilities for uncertain tax positions are measured based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We have experienced years when liabilities for uncertain tax positions were settled for amounts different from recorded amounts as described in \"Note 15-Income Taxes\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period, net of an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe fair value of the restricted stock awards and performance-based stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of certain performance-based awards with market conditions.\nWe determine the fair value of stock option awards granted using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The estimation of stock option fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about, among other things, employee exercise behavior, forfeiture rates, and the expected volatility of Leidos common stock over the expected option term. These judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized.\nDuring fiscal 2015, the expected term for all stock option awards granted was derived utilizing the simplified\u201d method due to the lack of historical experience post separation of New SAIC and expected volatility was estimated as of each grant date during fiscal 2015 based on a weighted average historical volatility of a group of publicly-traded peer companies for a period consistent with the expected option term due to lack of historical volatility after the spin-off of New SAIC in fiscal 2014. In the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, the expected volatility was estimated using a blended volatility method for a period consistent with the expected term based more significantly on the weighted average historical volatility of a group of publicly-traded peer companies and the weighted average implied volatility from traded options on Leidos stock for a time period prior to the grant date.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 57\nPART II\nDuring fiscal 2016, expected volatility was based on using a blended approach, which included weighted average historical volatility of a group of publicly-traded peer companies, our weighted average historical volatility and the weighted average implied volatility. We will continue to use peer group volatility information, until sufficient historical volatility of our common stock is relevant, to measure expected volatility for future option grants. The expected volatility increased from pre-acquisition to post-acquisition of the IS&GS Business in fiscal 2016 due to a higher allocation of peer group volatility used post-acquisition compared to a higher allocation of historical volatility used pre-acquisition. The post-acquisition volatility reflected an updated peer group mix. For fiscal 2016, we assumed weighted average volatilities of 29.9% and 37.9% before and after the acquisition of the IS&GS Business, respectively. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016 and fiscal 2015 we assumed a weighted average volatility of 24.5% and 25.1%, respectively. If other assumptions are held constant, an increase or decrease by 10% in our fiscal 2016 volatility assumptions would have changed the grant-date fair value of our stock options awarded during fiscal 2016 by approximately 12%.\nThe risk-free rate is derived using the yield curve of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option on the grant date and was derived in the same manner as in the prior years presented. The dividend yield increased from pre-acquisition to post-acquisition due to historical stock price fluctuations. We use historical data to estimate forfeitures.\nRecently Adopted and Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of these items, see \"Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEffects of Inflation\nApproximately 51% of our revenues are derived from cost-reimbursement type contracts, which are generally completed within one year. Bids for longer-term FFP and T&M and FP-LOE contracts typically include sufficient provisions for labor and other cost escalations to cover anticipated cost increases over the period of performance. As a result, our revenues and costs have generally both increased commensurate with inflation and net income as a percentage of total revenues has not been significantly affected.", "summary": "This report discusses Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal periods ending December 30, 2016, and January 1, 2016.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of Leidos Holdings, Inc.'s (\"Leidos\") financial condition, results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nUnless indicated otherwise, references in this report to the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer collectively to Leidos and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nAll amounts in this \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" are presented for our continuing operations.\nOn March 20, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement of our bylaws to change Leidos' year end from the Friday nearest the end of January to the Friday nearest the end of December. As a result of this change, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 11-month period which began on January 31, 2015, and ended on January 1, 2016. This change did not impact our prior reported fiscal years, which covered a 12-month period and ended on the Friday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015 began on February 1, 2014, and ended on January 30, 2015. This Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 covers a 12-month period that began on January 2, 2016, and ended on December 30, 2016.\nThe information presented in the Results of Operations compares fiscal 2016 (January 2, 2016 - December 30, 2016) to the 11-month transition period ended January 1, 2016 (January 31, 2015 - January 1, 2016) and compares the 11-month transition period ended January 1, 2016, to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015 (February 1, 2014 - January 2, 2015). As a result, fiscal 2016 includes an additional month of activity as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, which is a factor in the year-over-year changes discussed.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our intent, belief, or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, backlog, our industry, government budgets and spending, the impact of competition, and the performance and carrying value of our assets.

Annual Report - 37\nPART II\nOverview\nWe are a global science and technology company that provides technology and engineering services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities: command, control, computing, communications and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (\"C4ISR\"); cybersecurity; systems engineering; large-scale agile software development; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; and operations and sustainment. Our domestic customers include agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), the Department of Health and Human Services, other U.S. Government civil agencies and state and local government agencies. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Australia. The majority of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located in the United States.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we completed our acquisition of Lockheed Martin's IS&GS Business (see \"Note 2-Acquisitions\"). Our fiscal 2016 results include the results of the IS&GS Business for the period from August 16, 2016, to December 30, 2016. The acquired IS&GS Business was identified as a new operating and reportable segment (see \"Note 19-Business Segments\"). In fiscal 2016, we sold our design, build and heavy construction business. Consequently, the reportable segment of Health and Engineering was renamed as Health and Infrastructure (see \"Note 3-Divestitures\" and \"Note 19-Business Segments\"). We now operate in the following segments: National Security Solutions (\"NSS\"), Information Systems & Global Solutions (\"IS&GS\"), Health and Infrastructure (\"HIS\") and Corporate and Other.\nFor additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Business\u201d in Part I and \"Note 19-Business Segments\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur significant initiatives include the following:\n \u2022 achieving internal, or non-acquisition related, annual revenue growth through internal collaboration and better leveraging of key differentiators across our company and the deployment of resources and investments into higher growth markets; \n \u2022 increasing the growth of our operating profits through improving the quality of our revenues and contract profitability, continued improvement in our IT systems infrastructure and related business processes for greater effectiveness and efficiency across all business functions; and \n \u2022 disciplined deployment of our cash resources and use of our capital structure to enhance shareholder value while retaining an appropriate amount of financial leverage, through internal growth initiatives, stock repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, debt level management and other uses to achieve our goals.  Sales Trend. For fiscal 2016, revenues increased by $2.3 billion, or 49%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily attributable to revenues within our IS&GS segment. The revenue increase is also due to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, revenues increased by $22 million, or less than 1%, to $4.7 billion compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015, primarily due to growth in our engineering construction business as well as recent awards in our federal health business and for an international logistics program. This increase was partially offset by a decline in contract activities associated with support of Overseas Contingency Operations (\"OCO Contracts\") and continued decline in our commercial health business. See \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of our segment results.\nOperating Expenses and Income Trend. For fiscal 2016, operating expenses increased by $2.2 billion, or 51%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily attributable to the new IS&GS segment. Operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 5.9% compared to 6.8% for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred during fiscal 2016 related to the acquisition of the IS&GS Business. For fiscal 2016, our operating income was $417 million, a $97 million increase compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the newly acquired IS&GS Business.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 38\nPART II\nFor the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, operating expenses decreased by $489 million, or 10%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. Operating expenses decreased at a greater rate than revenues, resulting in an operating income margin of 6.8% for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, compared to a negative operating margin of 4.1% for the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, our operating income was $320 million, a $511 million increase compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. This increase in operating margin and income was primarily due to prior period goodwill and asset impairment charges and increased program margins coupled with improved product mix of higher margin security product sales. See \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of our segment results.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, our industry is under general competitive pressures due to spending from our largest customer, the U.S. Government, and has required and will require a higher level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive. Although the new Administration and Congress would like to significantly increase spending, primarily in the defense and homeland security sectors, it remains unclear whether or not they will be able to move such legislation through the Senate. We continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary.\nLockheed Martin Transaction\nOn January 26, 2016, Leidos announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the \"Merger Agreement\") with Lockheed Martin Corporation (\"Lockheed Martin\"); Abacus Innovations Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (\"Splitco\"); and Lion Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and, at the time of announcement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Leidos would combine with Lockheed Martin's realigned Information Systems & Global Solutions business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Lockheed Martin and Splitco entered into a Separation Agreement dated January 26, 2016 (as amended, the \"Separation Agreement\"), pursuant to which Lockheed Martin would separate the IS&GS Business from Lockheed Martin and transfer the IS&GS Business to Splitco. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement are referred to herein as the Transactions.\u201d\nOn August 16, 2016, the acquisition date, we completed the Transactions. In the Transactions, among other steps, (i) Lockheed Martin transferred the IS&GS Business to Splitco; (ii) Lockheed Martin offered to Lockheed Martin stockholders the right to exchange all or a portion of their shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Splitco common stock by way of an exchange offer (the \"Distribution\"); and (iii) Merger Sub merged with and into Splitco, with Splitco as the surviving corporation (the \"Merger\") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos. Additionally, on the closing date of the Transactions, Splitco's name was changed to Leidos Innovations Corporation. Upon consummation of the Transactions, those Lockheed Martin stockholders who elected to participate in the exchange offer received approximately 77 million shares of Leidos common stock, which represent approximately 50.5% of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock after consummation of the Transactions. Holders of Leidos shares prior to the transaction held the remaining 49.5% of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock immediately after the closing.\nPrior to the Distribution, Splitco incurred third-party debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion and immediately thereafter, Lockheed Martin transferred the IS&GS Business to Splitco and Splitco made a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin of $1.8 billion.\nIn connection with the Transactions, Leidos incurred new indebtedness and assumed Splitco's indebtedness in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $690 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, and entered into a new $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which replaced its existing revolving credit facility. See \"Note 11-Debt\" for further information regarding the new debt incurred and the new senior revolving credit facility.\nIn conjunction with the Transactions, Leidos' Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $13.64 per share of Leidos common stock. Consequently, on August 22, 2016, we paid $993 million to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016, and accrued $29 million of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding unvested equity awards. See \"Note 14-Stock Based Compensation\" for further information regarding the modifications made to our outstanding stock awards as a result of the special dividend.\nWe incurred $46 million of integration costs during fiscal 2016 and expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the Transactions through fiscal 2018.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

The spin-off was effected through a tax-free distribution to Leidos' stockholders of 100% of the shares of New SAIC's common stock. As a result of the spin-off, the results of operations and cash flows of New SAIC have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nDivestitures\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn addition to the spin-off of New SAIC discussed above, in order to better align our business portfolio with our strategy, we sold or committed to plans to dispose of certain non-strategic components of our business in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, which are reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nIn August 2014, we sold a business, historically included in our Health and Infrastructure segment, which primarily focused on full service emergency management consulting for disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation, for cash proceeds of $19 million, resulting in an immaterial gain on sale.\nIn January 2014, we committed to plans to dispose of Cloudshield Technologies, Inc. (\"Cloudshield\"), historically included in our National Security Solutions segment, which was previously acquired in fiscal 2011 and primarily focused on producing a suite of cybersecurity hardware and associated software and services. The sale transaction was completed in February 2015 with received cash proceeds of $5 million, resulting in an immaterial loss on sale.\nIn August 2013, we committed to plans to dispose of a business, historically included in our National Security Solutions segment, that primarily focused on technology used to detect if an individual is concealing explosive devices or other hidden weapons. In the first quarter ended May 2, 2014, we adjusted the carrying values of the business's assets to their fair value based on the estimated selling price of the business. The carrying value exceeded the fair value which resulted in $12 million of impairment charges recorded in discontinued operations, of which $9 million related to fixed assets and inventory and the remainder related to intangible assets. The sale transaction was completed in May 2014 with insignificant cash proceeds received, resulting in an immaterial loss on sale.\nThe operating results through the date of disposal of our discontinued operations discussed above for the periods presented were as follows: \nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 40\nPART II\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nU.S. Government Markets\nFor fiscal 2016, we generated approximately 81% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. Government. Revenues under contracts with the DoD, including subcontracts under which the DoD is the ultimate purchaser, represented approximately 56% of our total revenues for fiscal 2016. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. Government spending, especially national security, homeland security, and intelligence spending, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. Government.\nIn February 2016, the President delivered his requested budget for the government fiscal year (\"GFY\") 2017 budget cycle to Congress. The Appropriations Committee began its work for the year in March 2016 and made significant progress in committee. However, Congress failed to enact any of the 12 appropriations bills, which necessitated the passage of a series of continuing resolutions (\"CR\"). The federal government continues to operate under a CR which expires on April 28, 2017. There is a possibility of a government shutdown if Congress cannot agree to a long-term budget agreement; however, we believe that is unlikely. Furthermore, we expect the new Administration to submit a GFY 2018 budget later in the spring and, although Congress and the Administration are controlled by the same political party, there are no guarantees that any of the 12 appropriations bills will be enacted by the end of this government fiscal year.\nTrends in the U.S. Government contracting process, including a shift towards multiple-awards contracts (in which certain contractors are preapproved using indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (\"IDIQ\") and U.S. General Services Administration (\"GSA\") contract vehicles) and awarding contracts on a low price, technically acceptable basis, have increased competition for U.S. Government contracts, reduced backlogs by shortening periods of performance on contracts, and increased pricing pressure. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. For more information on these risks and uncertainties, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInternational Markets\nSales to customers in international markets represented 9% of total revenues for fiscal 2016 compared to 4% of total revenues for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily due to our acquisition of the IS&GS Business. The acquisition has increased the relative contribution from international business, particularly in the United Kingdom and Australia, and has therefore increased our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks.\nKey Performance Measures\nThe primary financial performance measures we use to manage our business and monitor results of operations are revenue, operating income, cash flows from operations and diluted EPS. We also believe that bookings and backlog are useful measures for management and investors to evaluate our performance and potential future revenues. In addition, we consider contract types to be a useful measure to management and investors in evaluating our operating income and margin performance.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

Annual Report - 42\nPART II\nThe revenue increase in constant currency(1) for fiscal 2016 was 50% as compared to an overall increase of 49%. The adverse foreign currency impact was attributable to our U.K. business in the NSS segment. Foreign currency impacts for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015, were immaterial.\nRevenues for fiscal 2016 include revenues from the recently acquired IS&GS Business. See \"Note 2-Acquisitions\" and the discussion on the IS&GS segment below.\nWe classify indirect costs incurred within or allocated to our U.S. Government customers as overhead (included in cost of revenues) and general and administrative expenses in the same manner as such costs are defined in our disclosure statements under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards. Effective January 31, 2015, we updated our disclosure statements, resulting in certain costs being classified differently either as cost of revenues or as general and administrative expenses on a prospective basis. These changes did not have an overall impact on the total expense or income reported.\nReportable Segment Results\nNational Security Solutions\n\nNational Security Solutions revenues increased $400 million, or 12%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. These increases were partially offset by reduced revenue due to lower scope and completion of certain contracts.\nIn constant currency, revenues increased 13% for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The adverse impact of foreign currency of 1% was primarily due to the movement of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound.\nNational Security Solutions revenues decreased $127 million, or 4%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. The revenue contraction was primarily attributable to contract activities associated with OCO Contracts which includes a reduction of airborne programs that support intelligence collection. Excluding the revenue declines associated with OCO Contracts, the remaining revenue for the National Securities Solutions segment increased by 2% primarily due to an increase in our logistics program. OCO Contracts contributed approximately $175 million in revenues for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016.\nNational Security Solutions operating income increased $29 million, or 11%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. This increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased revenues.\nNational Security Solutions operating income decreased $7 million, or 3%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. This decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues.\n(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the comparable period's foreign currency exchange rates. This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc.

As a result of this change, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the 11-month period which began on January 31, 2015, and ended on January 1, 2016. This change did not impact our prior reported fiscal years, which covered a 12-month period and ended on the Friday closest to January 31. Fiscal 2015 began on February 1, 2014, and ended on January 30, 2015. This Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016 covers a 12-month period that began on January 2, 2016, and ended on December 30, 2016.\nThe information presented in the Results of Operations compares fiscal 2016 (January 2, 2016 - December 30, 2016) to the 11-month transition period ended January 1, 2016 (January 31, 2015 - January 1, 2016) and compares the 11-month transition period ended January 1, 2016, to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015 (February 1, 2014 - January 2, 2015). As a result, fiscal 2016 includes an additional month of activity as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, which is a factor in the year-over-year changes discussed.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our intent, belief, or current expectations with respect to, among other things, trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations, backlog, our industry, government budgets and spending, the impact of competition, and the performance and carrying value of our assets.

Annual Report - 37\nPART II\nOverview\nWe are a global science and technology company that provides technology and engineering services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities: command, control, computing, communications and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (\"C4ISR\"); cybersecurity; systems engineering; large-scale agile software development; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; and operations and sustainment. Our domestic customers include agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"), the Department of Health and Human Services, other U.S. Government civil agencies and state and local government agencies. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in the United Kingdom, the Middle East and Australia. The majority of our revenues and tangible long-lived assets are generated by or owned by entities located in the United States.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we completed our acquisition of Lockheed Martin's IS&GS Business (see \"Note 2-Acquisitions\"). Our fiscal 2016 results include the results of the IS&GS Business for the period from August 16, 2016, to December 30, 2016. The acquired IS&GS Business was identified as a new operating and reportable segment (see \"Note 19-Business Segments\"). In fiscal 2016, we sold our design, build and heavy construction business. Consequently, the reportable segment of Health and Engineering was renamed as Health and Infrastructure (see \"Note 3-Divestitures\" and \"Note 19-Business Segments\"). We now operate in the following segments: National Security Solutions (\"NSS\"), Information Systems & Global Solutions (\"IS&GS\"), Health and Infrastructure (\"HIS\") and Corporate and Other.\nFor additional information regarding our reportable segments, see Business\u201d in Part I and \"Note 19-Business Segments\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur significant initiatives include the following:\n \u2022 achieving internal, or non-acquisition related, annual revenue growth through internal collaboration and better leveraging of key differentiators across our company and the deployment of resources and investments into higher growth markets; \n \u2022 increasing the growth of our operating profits through improving the quality of our revenues and contract profitability, continued improvement in our IT systems infrastructure and related business processes for greater effectiveness and efficiency across all business functions; and \n \u2022 disciplined deployment of our cash resources and use of our capital structure to enhance shareholder value while retaining an appropriate amount of financial leverage, through internal growth initiatives, stock repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, debt level management and other uses to achieve our goals.  Sales Trend. For fiscal 2016, revenues increased by $2.3 billion, or 49%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily attributable to revenues within our IS&GS segment. The revenue increase is also due to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, revenues increased by $22 million, or less than 1%, to $4.7 billion compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015, primarily due to growth in our engineering construction business as well as recent awards in our federal health business and for an international logistics program. This increase was partially offset by a decline in contract activities associated with support of Overseas Contingency Operations (\"OCO Contracts\") and continued decline in our commercial health business. See \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of our segment results.\nOperating Expenses and Income Trend. For fiscal 2016, operating expenses increased by $2.2 billion, or 51%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, primarily attributable to the new IS&GS segment. Operating margin for fiscal 2016 was 5.9% compared to 6.8% for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The decrease in operating margin was primarily due to acquisition and integration costs incurred during fiscal 2016 related to the acquisition of the IS&GS Business. For fiscal 2016, our operating income was $417 million, a $97 million increase compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily attributable to the operating results of the newly acquired IS&GS Business.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 38\nPART II\nFor the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, operating expenses decreased by $489 million, or 10%, compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. Operating expenses decreased at a greater rate than revenues, resulting in an operating income margin of 6.8% for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, compared to a negative operating margin of 4.1% for the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. For the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, our operating income was $320 million, a $511 million increase compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. This increase in operating margin and income was primarily due to prior period goodwill and asset impairment charges and increased program margins coupled with improved product mix of higher margin security product sales. See \"Results of Operations\" below for further discussion of our segment results.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, our industry is under general competitive pressures due to spending from our largest customer, the U.S. Government, and has required and will require a higher level of cost management focus to allow us to remain competitive. Although the new Administration and Congress would like to significantly increase spending, primarily in the defense and homeland security sectors, it remains unclear whether or not they will be able to move such legislation through the Senate. We continue to review our cost structure against our anticipated sales and undertake cost management actions and efficiency initiatives where necessary.\nLockheed Martin Transaction\nOn January 26, 2016, Leidos announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (as amended, the \"Merger Agreement\") with Lockheed Martin Corporation (\"Lockheed Martin\"); Abacus Innovations Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin (\"Splitco\"); and Lion Merger Co., a Delaware corporation and, at the time of announcement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Leidos would combine with Lockheed Martin's realigned Information Systems & Global Solutions business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Lockheed Martin and Splitco entered into a Separation Agreement dated January 26, 2016 (as amended, the \"Separation Agreement\"), pursuant to which Lockheed Martin would separate the IS&GS Business from Lockheed Martin and transfer the IS&GS Business to Splitco. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement are referred to herein as the Transactions.\u201d\nOn August 16, 2016, the acquisition date, we completed the Transactions. In the Transactions, among other steps, (i) Lockheed Martin transferred the IS&GS Business to Splitco; (ii) Lockheed Martin offered to Lockheed Martin stockholders the right to exchange all or a portion of their shares of Lockheed Martin common stock for shares of Splitco common stock by way of an exchange offer (the \"Distribution\"); and (iii) Merger Sub merged with and into Splitco, with Splitco as the surviving corporation (the \"Merger\") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos. Additionally, on the closing date of the Transactions, Splitco's name was changed to Leidos Innovations Corporation. Upon consummation of the Transactions, those Lockheed Martin stockholders who elected to participate in the exchange offer received approximately 77 million shares of Leidos common stock, which represent approximately 50.5% of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock after consummation of the Transactions. Holders of Leidos shares prior to the transaction held the remaining 49.5% of the outstanding shares of Leidos common stock immediately after the closing.\nPrior to the Distribution, Splitco incurred third-party debt financing in an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion and immediately thereafter, Lockheed Martin transferred the IS&GS Business to Splitco and Splitco made a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin of $1.8 billion.\nIn connection with the Transactions, Leidos incurred new indebtedness and assumed Splitco's indebtedness in the form of term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $690 million and $1.8 billion, respectively, and entered into a new $750 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which replaced its existing revolving credit facility. See \"Note 11-Debt\" for further information regarding the new debt incurred and the new senior revolving credit facility.\nIn conjunction with the Transactions, Leidos' Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $13.64 per share of Leidos common stock. Consequently, on August 22, 2016, we paid $993 million to stockholders of record as of August 15, 2016, and accrued $29 million of dividend equivalents with respect to outstanding unvested equity awards. See \"Note 14-Stock Based Compensation\" for further information regarding the modifications made to our outstanding stock awards as a result of the special dividend.\nWe incurred $46 million of integration costs during fiscal 2016 and expect to incur additional integration costs in connection with the Transactions through fiscal 2018.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 39\nPART II\nIn connection with the Transactions, certain additional agreements were entered into, including, among others an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, transition services agreements, an intellectual property matters agreement, agreements relating to certain government contracts matters, supply agreements and certain real estate related agreements.\nSpin-off Transaction\nIn accordance with a distribution agreement, on September 27, 2013 (the \"Distribution Date\"), Leidos completed a spin-off of its technical services and enterprise information technology services business into an independent, publicly traded company named Science Application International Corporation (\"New SAIC\"). The spin-off was effected through a tax-free distribution to Leidos' stockholders of 100% of the shares of New SAIC's common stock.

The revenue increase was primarily attributable to revenues from our international business and increases in fees resulting from the achievement of contract milestones and related profit write-ups on certain contracts. These increases were partially offset by reduced revenue due to lower scope and completion of certain contracts.\nIn constant currency, revenues increased 13% for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. The adverse impact of foreign currency of 1% was primarily due to the movement of the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the British pound.\nNational Security Solutions revenues decreased $127 million, or 4%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. The revenue contraction was primarily attributable to contract activities associated with OCO Contracts which includes a reduction of airborne programs that support intelligence collection. Excluding the revenue declines associated with OCO Contracts, the remaining revenue for the National Securities Solutions segment increased by 2% primarily due to an increase in our logistics program. OCO Contracts contributed approximately $175 million in revenues for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016.\nNational Security Solutions operating income increased $29 million, or 11%, for fiscal 2016 as compared to the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016. This increase in operating income was primarily attributable to increased revenues.\nNational Security Solutions operating income decreased $7 million, or 3%, for the 11-month period ended January 1, 2016, as compared to the 11-month period ended January 2, 2015. This decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues.\n(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the comparable period's foreign currency exchange rates.
