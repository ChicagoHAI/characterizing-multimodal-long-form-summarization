MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition, results of operations or percentage relationships for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts in the tables included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2001. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.\nWe were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (1) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (2) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our investment objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with each investment generally ranging from $8 million to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment. We expect that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 90.0% debt investments and 10.0% equity investments, at cost. As of September 30, 2018, our investment portfolio was made up of approximately 91.4% debt investments and 8.6% equity investments, at cost.\nWe focus on investing in lower middle market companies (which we generally define as companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3 million to $15 million) in the U.S. that meet certain criteria, including, but not limited to, the following: the sustainability of the business' free cash flow and its ability to grow it over time, adequate assets for loan collateral, experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower, reasonable capitalization of the borrower, including an ample equity contribution or cushion based on prevailing enterprise valuation multiples and, to a lesser extent, the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position, if any. We lend to borrowers that need funds for growth capital or to finance acquisitions or recapitalize or refinance their existing debt facilities. We seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises. Our targeted portfolio companies are generally considered too small for the larger capital marketplace. We invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity and have opportunistically made several co-investments with our affiliate Gladstone Investment, a BDC also managed by our Adviser, pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the SEC. We believe this ability to co-invest will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone.\nBusiness\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nIn general, our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years, accrue interest at variable rates (generally based on the one-month LIBOR) and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. We seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or, at a minimum, quarterly, may have a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only, with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity. Generally, success fees accrue at a set rate and are contractually due upon a change of control of a portfolio company, typically from an exit or sale. Some debt securities have deferred interest whereby some portion of the interest payment is added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid, together with the principal, at maturity. This form of deferred interest is often called PIK interest.\nTypically, our equity investments consist of common stock, preferred stock, limited liability company interests, or warrants to purchase the foregoing. Often, these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment, recapitalizing a business, or refinancing existing debt.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we invested $67.9 million in ten new portfolio companies and extended $38.7 million of investments to existing portfolio companies. In addition, during the year ended September 30, 2018, we exited seven portfolio companies through sales and early payoffs. We received a total of $66.9 million in combined net proceeds and principal repayments from the aforementioned portfolio company exits as well as existing portfolio companies during the year ended September 30, 2018. This activity resulted in a net increase in our overall portfolio by three portfolio companies to 50 and a net increase of $16.0 million in our portfolio at cost since September 30, 2017. From our initial public offering in August 2001 through September 30, 2018, we have made 495 different loans to, or investments in, 226 companies for a total of approximately $1.8 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, the following significant transactions occurred:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> In October 2017, we sold our investment in Flight Fit N Fun LLC for a realized gain of $0.6 million.

We have successfully extended the Credit Facility's revolving period multiple times, most recently to January 2021, and currently have a total commitment amount of $190.0 million. Additionally, we issued 2.1 million shares of our 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cSeries 2024 Term Preferred Stock\u201d) at a public offering price of $25 per share, for gross proceeds of $51.8 million in September 2017, inclusive of the overallotment, and approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $17.3 million in October 2016, inclusive of the November 2016 overallotment. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2018, we sold 2,341,296 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program at a weighted-average price of $9.39 per share and raised $22.0 million of gross proceeds. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility.\nAlthough we were able to access the capital markets historically and in recent years, we believe uncertain market conditions could affect the trading price of our capital stock and thus may inhibit our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity. When our common stock trades below NAV per common share, as it has often done in previous years, our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below NAV per common share without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors, other than through sales to our then-existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering. We did not request that our stockholders approve the Company's ability to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share at our annual meeting of stockholders held on February 8, 2018. Should we decide to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share in the future, we will seek the requisite approval of our stockholders at such time.\nOn November 13, 2018, the closing market price of our common stock was $9.28, an 11.5% premium to our September 30, 2018 NAV per share of $8.32.\nRefer to Note 15-Subsequent Events in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional capital raised in connection with issuance of the 2023 Notes.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOur ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have an asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act) of at least 200% (currently) or 150% (effective April 10, 2019) on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d and our \u201csenior securities that are stock.\u201d\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the date of the Board of Directors' approval; or April 10, 2019. Under the current 200% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 10, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to certain provisions of our Credit Facility and our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d was 359.0% and our asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities that are stock\u201d was 244.4%.\nRecent Developments\nDebt Offering\nIn November 2018, we completed a public debt offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2023, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after November 1, 2020. The 2023 Notes are traded under the ticker symbol \u201cGLADD\u201d on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nDistributions\nOn October 9, 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution\nper Common\nShare </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution\nper Series\n2024 Term\nPreferred\nShare </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 19, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 20, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>November 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 20, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total for the Quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Portfolio and Investment Activity\nIn October 2018, our investment in TWS Acquisition Corporation paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $2.0 million.\nIn October and November 2018, we invested a total of $1.6 million in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. through secured second lien debt.\nIn November 2018, we invested $2.0 million in GOBP Holdings, Inc.

ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the weighted average balance outstanding on our interest-bearing portfolio and an increase in the weighted average yield on our interest-bearing portfolio. The weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended September 30, 2018, was $372.2 million, compared to $320.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $52.1 million, or 16.3%. The weighted average yield on our interest-bearing investments is based on the current stated interest rates on interest-bearing investments which increased to 11.8% for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to 11.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017, inclusive of any allowances on interest receivables made during those periods.\nAs of September 30, 2018, one portfolio company, Francis Drilling Fluids, Ltd. (\u201cFDF\u201d) was on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $26.9 million, or 6.9% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2017, two portfolio companies, Sunshine and Alloy Die Casting Co. (\u201cADC\u201d), were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $27.9 million, or 7.5% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio.\nOther income decreased by 24.9% during the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in success fees recognized year over year. For the year ended September 30, 2018, other income consisted primarily of $0.6 million in prepayment fees received, $0.5 million in dividend income, and $0.4 million in success fees recognized. For the year ended September 30, 2017, other income consisted primarily of $1.5 million in success fees recognized, $0.3 million in dividend income, and $0.3 million in prepayment fees received.\nThe following tables list the investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments at fair value during the respective years:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nInvestment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IA Tech, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NetFortris Corp.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lignetics, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact!

This increase was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in our net base management and incentive fees to the Adviser and a $2.8 million increase in interest expense on borrowings, partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in dividend expense on mandatorily redeemable preferred stock.\nInterest expense increased by 90.6% during the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to an increase in the weighted average balance outstanding on our Credit Facility. The weighted average balance outstanding during the year ended September 30, 2018, was $114.7 million, as compared to $58.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 96.4%. The effective interest rate on our Credit Facility, including unused commitment fees incurred but excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, was 5.1% during the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to 5.3% during the prior year. The decrease in the effective interest rate was driven by a decrease in the marginal interest rate on our Credit Facility effective March 9, 2018 and a decrease in unused commitment fees paid in the current year due to a greater amount outstanding on the credit facility. These factors were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR as compared to the prior year.\nThe net base management fee earned by the Adviser increased by $1.7 million, or 42.2%, during the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year, resulting from an increase in average total assets subject to the base management fee and a decrease in credits from the Adviser year over year.\nThe net income-based incentive fee increased by $1.2 million, or 48.3%, for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year, due to higher pre-incentive fee net investment income, partially offset by an increase in net assets, which drives the hurdle, over the prior year. Our Board of Directors accepted a non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credit from the Adviser of $1.7 million to reduce the income-based incentive fee to the extent net investment income did not cover 100.0% of our distributions to common stockholders during the year ended September 30, 2018. The credit granted during the year ended September 30, 2017, totaled $2.3 million.\nThe base management, loan servicing and incentive fees, and associated non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits, are computed quarterly, as described under \u201cTransactions with the Adviser\u201d in Note 4-Related Party Transactions of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized in the following table:\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average total assets subject to base management fee(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>401,886 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiplied by annual base management fee of 1.75%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base management fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,781 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio company fee credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,020 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,588 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicated loan fee credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(364 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(221 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Base Management Fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,972 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,042 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit to base management fee -

ended September 30, 2017, were an increase in the value of WadeCo, increased performance on certain of our portfolio companies, and the reversal of previously recorded depreciation on our investment in Sunshine upon partial write-off. These factors were partially offset by a decline in performance and decrease in comparable multiples used in the valuation of certain of our other portfolio companies and the reversal of $3.2 million of previously recorded unrealized appreciation on our investment in Behrens upon exit.\nAs of September 30, 2018, the fair value of our investment portfolio was less than its cost basis by approximately $37.4 million and our entire investment portfolio was valued at 91.2% of cost, as compared to cumulative net unrealized depreciation of $59.1 million and a valuation of our entire portfolio at 85.6% of cost as of September 30, 2017. This year over year increase in the cumulative unrealized depreciation on investments represents net unrealized appreciation of $21.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.\nThe cumulative net unrealized depreciation of our investments does not have an impact on our current ability to pay distributions to stockholders; however, it may be an indication of future realized losses, which could ultimately reduce our income available for distribution to stockholders.\nNet Unrealized (Appreciation) Depreciation of Other\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded $0.1 million of

ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the weighted average yield on our interest-bearing portfolio. The weighted average yield on our interest-bearing investments is based on the current stated interest rate on interest-bearing investments which increased to 11.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to 11.1% for the year ended September 30, 2016, inclusive of any allowances on interest receivables made during those periods. The weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended September 30, 2017, was $320.1 million, compared to $317.0 million for the prior year, an increase of $3.1 million, or 1.0%.\nAs of September 30, 2017, certain loans to two portfolio companies, Sunshine and ADC, were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $27.9 million, or 7.5% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2016, certain loans to two portfolio companies, Sunshine and Vertellus Holdings, LLC, were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $26.5 million, or 7.7% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio.\nOther income decreased by 44.5% during the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.9 million decrease in success fees recognized year over year. For the year ended September 30, 2017, other income consisted primarily of $1.5 million in success fees recognized, $0.3 million in dividend income, and $0.3 million in prepayment fees received. For the year ended September 30, 2016, other income consisted primarily of $3.4 million in success fees recognized, $0.3 million in dividend income, and $0.2 million in prepayment fees.\nThe following tables list the investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments at fair value during the respective years:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nInvestment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NetFortris Corp.

Adviser, decreased by 9.3% for the year ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in our net base management and incentive fees to the Advisor.\nInterest expense increased by 6.0% during the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the prior year, due to an increase in the LIBOR component of the effective interest rate partially offset by a lower weighted average balance outstanding. The effective interest rate on our Credit Facility, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs, was 5.3% during the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to 4.5% during the prior year period. The weighted average balance outstanding on our Credit Facility during the year ended September 30, 2017, was approximately $58.4 million, as compared to $64.0 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 8.8%.\nOther expenses decreased by 20.9% during the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in shareholder related costs and professional fees.\nNet base management fee earned by the Adviser decreased by $0.8 million, or 17.4%, during the year ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the prior year period, resulting from an increase in portfolio company fee credits due to new investments made in the current year period.\nOur Board of Directors accepted non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits from the Adviser to reduce the income-based incentive fee to the extent net investment income did not cover 100.0% of our distributions to common stockholders during the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, which credits totaled $2.3 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\nThe base management, loan servicing and incentive fees, and associated non-contractual, unconditional and irrevocable credits, are computed quarterly, as described under \u201cTransactions with the Adviser\u201d in Note 4-Related Party Transactions of the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are summarized in the following table:\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average total assets subject to base management fee(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>330,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,800 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Multiplied by annual base management fee of 1.75%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Base management fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,684 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio company fee credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,588 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(785 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Syndicated loan fee credit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(221 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net Base Management Fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,807 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan servicing fee(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,890 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit to base management fee -

were a decline in financial and operation performance of certain portfolio companies and the reversal of $16.0 million of previously recorded unrealized appreciation on our investment in Funko, LLC upon exit. This depreciation was partially offset by unrealized appreciation, primarily on RBC of $11.9 million, which was driven by proceeds received associated with the sale of RBC in November 2016, and the reversal of $4.2 million of previously recorded unrealized depreciation on our investment in Targus upon restructure.\nAs of September 30, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio was less than its cost basis by approximately $59.1 million and our entire investment portfolio was valued at 85.6% of cost, as compared to cumulative net unrealized depreciation of $59.7 million and a valuation of our entire portfolio at 84.4% of cost as of September 30, 2016. This year over year increase in the cumulative unrealized depreciation on investments represents net unrealized appreciation of $0.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2017.\nThe cumulative net unrealized depreciation of our investments does not have an impact on our current ability to pay distributions to stockholders; however, it may be an indication of future realized losses, which could ultimately reduce our income available for distribution to stockholders.\nNet Unrealized (Appreciation) Depreciation of Other\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded $0.1 million of unrealized depreciation on our Credit Facility at fair value. During the year ended September 30, 2016, we reversed $0.1 million of unrealized depreciation related to the expiration of our interest rate cap agreement in January 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOperating Activities\nOur cash flows from operating activities are primarily generated from the interest payments on debt securities that we receive from our portfolio companies, as well as net proceeds received through repayments or sales of our investments. We utilize this cash primarily to fund new investments, make interest payments on our Credit Facility, make distributions to our stockholders, pay management and administrative fees to the Adviser and Administrator, and for other operating expenses.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2018 was $17.6 million as compared to $12.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2017. The change was primarily due to a decrease in principal repayments and net proceeds from sales of investments partially offset by a decrease in purchases of investments year over year. Repayments and net proceeds from sales were $67.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to $83.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2017. Purchase of investments was $106.6 million during the year ended September 30, 2018, compared to $112.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $12.9 million as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $60.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2016. The change was primarily due to an increase in purchases of investments and a decrease in principal repayments on investments and net proceeds from sale of investments period over period. Purchases of investments were $112.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $80.0 million during the prior year period. Repayments and net proceeds from sales were $83.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2017 compared to $121.1 million during the year ended September 30, 2016.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had loans to, syndicated participations in or equity investments in 50 companies, with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $427.5 million. As of September 30, 2017, we had loans to, syndicated participations in or equity investments in 47 companies, with an aggregate cost basis of approximately $411.4 million.\nThe following table

million in net borrowings on our Credit Facility and $22.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by $22.8 million in distributions to common stockholders.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2017 was $11.7 million, which consisted primarily of $21.7 million in net borrowings on our Credit Facility and $22.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, partially offset by $21.4 million in distributions to common stockholders and a net decrease of $9.3 million in term preferred stock due to the redemption of our Series 2021 Term Preferred Stock and issuance of a lesser amount of Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2016 was $57.7 million, which consisted primarily of $56.0 million in net repayments on our Credit Facility and $19.5 million in distributions to common stockholders, partially offset by $19.7 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock, net of underwriting costs.\nDistributions to Stockholders\nCommon Stock Distributions\nTo qualify to be taxed as a RIC and thus avoid corporate level federal income tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders, we are required to distribute to our stockholders on an annual basis at least 90.0% of our investment company taxable income. Additionally, our Credit Facility has a covenant that generally restricts the amount of distributions to stockholders that we can pay out to be no greater than our aggregate net investment income, net capital gains and amounts elected to have been paid during the prior year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. In accordance with these requirements, we paid monthly cash distributions of $0.07 per common share for each month during the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, which totaled an aggregate of $22.8 million, $21.4 million and $19.5 million, respectively. In October 2018, our Board of Directors declared a monthly distribution of $0.07 per common share for each of October, November and December 2018. Our Board of Directors declared these distributions to our stockholders based on our estimates of our investment company taxable income for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. From inception through September 30, 2018, we have paid 188 either monthly or quarterly consecutive distributions to common stockholders totaling approximately $320.6 million or $18.61 per share.\nFor each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, Investment Company Taxable Income exceeded distributions declared and paid, and, in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code, we elected to treat $0.3 million, $0.3 million, and $5.5 million, respectively, of the first distributions paid to common stockholders in the respective subsequent fiscal year as having been paid in the respective prior year.\nPreferred Stock Dividends\nOur Board of Directors declared and we paid monthly cash dividends of $0.140625 per share to holders of our Series 2021 Term Preferred Stock for each month during the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, which totaled an aggregate of $4.1 million during each of the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. In October 2017, our Board of Directors declared a combined dividend for the pro-rated period from and including the issuance date, September 27, 2017, to and including September 30, 2017 and the full month of October 2017, which totaled $0.141667 per share, to the holders of our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock and monthly cash dividends of $0.125 per share to holders of our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock for each of the eleven months from November 2017 through September 2018.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we treat these monthly dividends as an operating expense. For federal income tax purposes, the dividends paid by us to preferred stockholders generally constitute ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and is reported after the end of the calendar year based on tax information for the full fiscal year. Such a characterization made on an interim, quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax characterization for the full year.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nOur common stockholders who hold their shares through our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc. (\u201cComputershare\u201d), have the option to participate in a dividend reinvestment plan offered by Computershare, as the plan agent. This is an \u201copt in\u201d dividend reinvestment plan, meaning that common stockholders may elect to have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock. Common stockholders who do make such election will receive their distributions in cash. Common stockholders who receive distributions in the form of stock will be subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as stockholders who elect to receive their distributions in cash. The common stockholder will have an adjusted basis in the additional common shares purchased through the plan equal to the amount of the reinvested distribution. The additional shares will have a new holding period commencing on the day following the date on which the shares are credited to the common stockholder's account. Computershare purchases shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan. The Computershare dividend reinvestment plan is not open to holders of our preferred stock.\nEquity\nRegistration Statement\nWe filed Post-Effective Amendment No. 5 to our current universal shelf registration statement on Form N-2 (our \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d) (File No. 333-208637) with the SEC on December 19, 2017, which was declared effective by the SEC on February 1, 2018. Our Registration Statement permits us to issue, through one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of $300.0 million in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, subscription rights, debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. As of September 30, 2018, we had the ability to issue up to $202.6 million in securities under the Registration Statement.\nCommon Stock\nIn February 2015, we entered into equity distribution agreements (commonly referred to as \u201cat-the-market agreements\u201d or the \u201cSales Agreements\u201d) with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., each a \u201cSales Agent,\u201d under which we had the ability to issue and sell, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, up to an aggregate offering price of $50.0 million shares of our common stock. In May 2017, we terminated the Sales Agreement with KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. and amended the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to reference our current registration statement. All other material terms of the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. remained unchanged. During the year ended September 30, 2018, we sold 2,341,296 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., at a weighted-average price of $9.39 per share and raised $22.0 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds, after deducting commissions and offering costs borne by us, were approximately $21.6 million. As of September 30, 2018, we had a remaining capacity to sell up to $20.5 million of common stock under the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. During the year ended September 30, 2017, we sold 642,818 shares of our common stock under the Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., at a weighted-average price of $9.88 per share and raised $6.4 million of gross proceeds. Net proceeds, after deducting commissions and offering costs borne by us, were approximately $6.1 million.\nPursuant to our Registration Statement, in October 2016, we completed a public offering of 2.0 million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.98 per share, which was below our then-current NAV per share. In November 2016, the underwriters partially exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional 173,444 shares of our common stock. Gross proceeds totaled $17.3 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs borne by us, were approximately $16.4 million. The net proceeds of this offering were used to repay borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nWe anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future. However, we cannot determine the timing or terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us, or at all. To the extent that our common stock trades at a market price below our NAV per share, we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock, other than pursuant to stockholder and independent director approval or a rights offering to existing common stockholders. We did not request that our stockholders approve the Company's ability to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV at our annual meeting of stockholders held on February 8, 2018. Should we decide to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV in the future, we will seek the requisite approval of our stockholders at such time.\nOn November 13, 2018, the closing market price of our common stock was $9.28, an 11.5% premium to our September 30, 2018 NAV per share of $8.32.\nTerm Preferred Stock\nPursuant to our Registration Statement, in September 2017, we completed a public offering of approximately 2.1 million shares of our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock at a public offering price of $25.00 per share. Gross proceeds totaled $51.8 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us, were approximately $49.8 million. We incurred approximately $1.9 million in total underwriting discounts and offering costs related to the issuance of the Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock, which have been recorded as discounts to the liquidation value on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities and are being amortized over the period from issuance through September 30, 2024, the mandatory redemption date. The offering proceeds plus borrowings under our Credit Facility were used to voluntarily redeem all 2.4 million outstanding shares of our then existing Series 2021 Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. In connection with the voluntary redemption of our Series 2021 Term Preferred Stock, we incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.3 million, which has been reflected in Realized loss on other in our accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and which is primarily comprised of the unamortized deferred issuance costs at the time of redemption.\nThe shares of our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock are traded under the ticker symbol \u201cGLADN\u201d on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock is not convertible into our common stock or any other security and provides for a fixed dividend equal to 6.00% per year, payable monthly (which equates in total to approximately $3.1 million per year). We are required to redeem all of the outstanding Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock on September 30, 2024 for cash at a redemption price equal to $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to all unpaid dividends and distributions per share accumulated to (but excluding) the date of redemption (the \u201cRedemption Price\u201d). We may additionally be required to mandatorily redeem some or all of the shares of our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock early, at the Redemption Price, in the event of the following: (1) upon the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a change in control, or (2) if we fail to maintain an asset coverage of at least 200% on our \u201csenior securities that are stock\u201d (which is currently only our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock) and the failure remains for a period of 30 days following the filing date of our next SEC quarterly or annual report. The asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities that are stock\u201d as of September 30, 2018 was 244.4%, calculated in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act.\nWe may also voluntarily redeem all or a portion of the Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock at our option at the Redemption Price at any time after September 30, 2019. If we fail to redeem our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock pursuant to the mandatory redemption required on September 30, 2024, or in any other circumstance in which we are required to mandatorily redeem our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock, then the fixed dividend rate will increase by 4.0% for so long as such failure continues. As of September 30, 2018, we have not redeemed, nor have we been required to redeem, any shares of our outstanding Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn March 9, 2018, we, through Business Loan, entered into Amendment No. 4 to our Credit Facility with KeyBank, which increased the commitment amount from $170.0 million to $190.0 million, extended the revolving period end date by approximately 2 years to January 15, 2021, decreased the marginal interest rate added to 30-day LIBOR from 3.25% to 2.85% per annum, and changed the unused commitment fee from 0.50% of the total unused commitment amount to 0.50% when the average unused commitment amount for the reporting period is less than or equal to 50%, 0.75% when the average unused commitment amount for the reporting period is greater than 50% but less than or equal to 65%, and 1.00% when the average unused commitment amount for the reporting period is greater than 65%. If our Credit Facility is not renewed or extended by January 15, 2021, all principal and interest will be due and payable on or before April 15, 2022 (fifteen months after the revolving period end date). Subject to certain terms and conditions, our Credit Facility may be expanded up to a total of $265.0 million through additional commitments of new or existing lenders. We incurred fees of approximately $1.2 million in connection with this amendment, which are being amortized through our Credit Facility's revolving period end date of January 15, 2021.\nInterest is payable monthly during the term of our Credit Facility. Available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under our Credit Facility, based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by Business Loan, which varies as loans are added and repaid, regardless of whether such repayments are prepayments or made as contractually required. Our Credit Facility also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with KeyBank and with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. as custodian. KeyBank, which also serves as the trustee of the account, generally remits the collected funds to us once a month.\nOur Credit Facility contains covenants that require Business Loan to maintain its status as a separate legal entity, prohibit certain significant corporate transactions (such as mergers, consolidations, liquidations or dissolutions), and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies without the lenders' consents. Our Credit Facility generally limits distributions to our stockholders on a fiscal year basis to the sum of our net investment income, net capital gains and amounts elected to have been paid during the prior year in accordance with Section 855(a) of the Code. Business Loan is also subject to certain limitations on the type of loan investments it can apply as collateral towards the borrowing base to receive additional borrowing availability under our Credit Facility, including restrictions on geographic concentrations, sector concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life, portfolio company leverage and lien property. Our Credit Facility further requires Business Loan to comply with other financial and operational covenants, which obligate Business Loan to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of 25 obligors required in the borrowing base.\nAdditionally, we are subject to a performance guaranty that requires us to maintain (i) a minimum net worth (defined in our Credit Facility to include our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock) of $205.0 million plus 50% of all equity and subordinated debt raised after May 1, 2015 less 50% of any equity and subordinated debt retired or redeemed after May 1, 2015, which equates to $232.8 million as of September 30, 2018, (ii) asset coverage with respect to \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d of at least 200%, in accordance with Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act and (iii) our status as a BDC under the 1940 Act and as a RIC under the Code.\nAs of September 30, 2018, and as defined in the performance guaranty of our Credit Facility, we had a net worth of $285.8 million, asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d of 359.0% and an active status as a BDC and RIC. In addition, we had 32 obligors in our Credit Facility's borrowing base as of September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all of our Credit Facility covenants. Refer to Note 5-Borrowings of our accompanying Note to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our Credit Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe generally recognize success fee income when the payment has been received. As of September 30, 2018 and 2017, we had off-balance sheet success fee receivables on our accruing debt investments of $5.1 million and $4.6 million (or approximately $0.18 per common share for each period), respectively, that would be owed to us, generally upon a change of control of the portfolio companies. Consistent with GAAP, we generally have not recognized our success fee receivables and related income in our Consolidated Financial Statements until earned. Due to the contingent nature of our success fees, there are no guarantees that we will be able to collect all of these success fees or know the timing of such collections.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have lines of credit, delayed draw term loans, and an uncalled capital commitment with certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn. Since these commitments have expiration dates and we expect many will never be fully drawn, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We estimate the fair value of the combined unused lines of credit, the unused delayed draw term loans and the uncalled capital commitment as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017 to be immaterial.\nThe following table shows our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2018, at cost:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Stock\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,750 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense on debt obligations(C)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,391 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9, 249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>202,141 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>(A) </td> <td> Excludes our unused line of credit commitments, an unused delayed draw term loan and uncalled capital commitments to our portfolio companies in an aggregate amount of $10.1 million, at cost, as of September 30, 2018.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td>(B) </td> <td> Principal balance of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, based on the current contractual revolver period end date to the revolving nature of the facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>(C) </td> <td> Includes estimated interest payments on our Credit Facility and dividend obligations on our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock.

Actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified our investment valuation policy (which has been approved by our Board of Directors) (the \u201cPolicy\u201d) as our most critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, refer to Note 3-Investments in our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our application of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \u201cFair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d We have also identified our revenue recognition policy as a critical accounting policy, which is described in Note 2- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInvestment Valuation\nCredit Monitoring and Risk Rating\nThe Adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance and, in some instances, used as inputs in our valuation techniques. Generally, we, through the Adviser, participate in periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold board seats and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using these statements or comparable information and board discussions, the Adviser calculates and evaluates certain credit statistics.\nThe Adviser risk rates all of our investments in debt securities. The Adviser does not risk rate our equity securities. For syndicated loans that have been rated by an SEC registered Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (\u201cNRSRO\u201d), the Adviser generally uses the average of two corporate level NRSRO's risk ratings for such security. For all other debt securities, the Adviser uses a proprietary risk rating system. While the Adviser seeks to mirror the NRSRO systems, we cannot provide any assurance that the Adviser's risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an NRSRO would for these securities. The Adviser's risk rating system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the expected loss if there is a default. The Adviser's risk rating system uses a scale of 0 to >10, with >10 being the lowest probability of default. It is the Adviser's understanding that most debt securities of medium-sized companies do not exceed the grade of BBB on an NRSRO scale, so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of AAA, AA or A. Therefore, the Adviser's scale begins with the designation >10 as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a BBB from an NRSRO; however, no assurance can be given that a >10 on the Adviser's scale is equal to a BBB or Baa2 on an NRSRO scale. The Adviser's risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold.\nThe following table reflects risk ratings for all proprietary loans in our portfolio (all of which were risk rated by our Adviser) at September 30, 2018 and 2017, representing approximately 92.3% and 91.9%, respectively, of the principal balance of all debt investments in our portfolio at the end of each period:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Highest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lowest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reflects the risk ratings for all syndicated loans in our portfolio that were rated by an NRSRO at September 30, 2018 and 2017, representing approximately 5.7% and 6.9%, respectively, of the principal balance of all debt investments in our portfolio at the end of each fiscal year:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Highest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lowest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> The following table reflects the risk ratings for all syndicated loans in our portfolio that were not rated by an NRSRO at September 30, 2018 and 2017, representing approximately 2.0% and 1.2%, respectively, of the principal balance of all debt investments in our portfolio at the end of each fiscal year:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Highest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted Average\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lowest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Tax Status\nWe intend to continue to maintain our qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for federal income tax purposes and also to limit certain federal excise taxes imposed on RICs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition, results of operations or percentage relationships for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts in the tables included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2001. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.\nWe were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (1) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (2) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains. To achieve our investment objectives, our investment strategy is to invest in several categories of debt and equity securities, with each investment generally ranging from $8 million to $30 million, although investment size may vary, depending upon our total assets or available capital at the time of investment. We expect that our investment portfolio over time will consist of approximately 90.0% debt investments and 10.0% equity investments, at cost. As of September 30, 2018, our investment portfolio was made up of approximately 91.4% debt investments and 8.6% equity investments, at cost.\nWe focus on investing in lower middle market companies (which we generally define as companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3 million to $15 million) in the U.S. that meet certain criteria, including, but not limited to, the following: the sustainability of the business' free cash flow and its ability to grow it over time, adequate assets for loan collateral, experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower, reasonable capitalization of the borrower, including an ample equity contribution or cushion based on prevailing enterprise valuation multiples and, to a lesser extent, the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position, if any. We lend to borrowers that need funds for growth capital or to finance acquisitions or recapitalize or refinance their existing debt facilities. We seek to avoid investing in high-risk, early-stage enterprises. Our targeted portfolio companies are generally considered too small for the larger capital marketplace. We invest by ourselves or jointly with other funds and/or management of the portfolio company, depending on the opportunity and have opportunistically made several co-investments with our affiliate Gladstone Investment, a BDC also managed by our Adviser, pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the SEC. We believe this ability to co-invest will continue to enhance our ability to further our investment objectives and strategies. If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone.\nBusiness\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nIn general, our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years, accrue interest at variable rates (generally based on the one-month LIBOR) and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. We seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or, at a minimum, quarterly, may have a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only, with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity. Generally, success fees accrue at a set rate and are contractually due upon a change of control of a portfolio company, typically from an exit or sale. Some debt securities have deferred interest whereby some portion of the interest payment is added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid, together with the principal, at maturity. This form of deferred interest is often called PIK interest.\nTypically, our equity investments consist of common stock, preferred stock, limited liability company interests, or warrants to purchase the foregoing. Often, these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment, recapitalizing a business, or refinancing existing debt.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we invested $67.9 million in ten new portfolio companies and extended $38.7 million of investments to existing portfolio companies. In addition, during the year ended September 30, 2018, we exited seven portfolio companies through sales and early payoffs. We received a total of $66.9 million in combined net proceeds and principal repayments from the aforementioned portfolio company exits as well as existing portfolio companies during the year ended September 30, 2018. This activity resulted in a net increase in our overall portfolio by three portfolio companies to 50 and a net increase of $16.0 million in our portfolio at cost since September 30, 2017. From our initial public offering in August 2001 through September 30, 2018, we have made 495 different loans to, or investments in, 226 companies for a total of approximately $1.8 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, the following significant transactions occurred:\n \u2022 In October 2017, we sold our investment in Flight Fit N Fun LLC for a realized gain of $0.6 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $9.4 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $7.8 million at par. \n \u2022 In October 2017, we invested $11.0 million in Applied Voice & Speech Technologies, Inc. through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In October 2017, our investment in PSC Industrial Holdings, LLC paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $3.5 million. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $7.5 million in Arc Drilling Holdings LLC through a combination of secured first lien debt and equity. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $7.5 million in Gray Matter Systems, LLC through secured second lien debt. In March 2018, we invested an additional $3.6 million in Gray Matter Systems, LLC, through secured second lien debt. \n \u2022 In November 2017, our investment in DataPipe, Inc. paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $2.0 million. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $5.0 million in DigiCert Holdings, Inc. through secured second lien debt. In March 2018, we sold $2.0 million of this investment for net cash proceeds of $2.0 million. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $4.0 million in Red Ventures, LLC through secured second lien debt. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $1.0 million in ABG Intermediate Holdings 2, LLC through secured second lien debt. In January 2018, we sold this investment for net cash proceeds of $1.0 million. \n \u2022 In December 2017, we invested $20.0 million in Impact! Chemical Technologies, Inc. through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In January 2018, we invested $8.1 million in XMedius Solutions Inc. through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In February 2018, we invested an additional $4.0 million in an existing portfolio company, Lignetics, Inc., through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In March, July and September 2018, an existing portfolio company, EL Academies, Inc., drew $1.4 million, $4.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively, on the unused portion of its secured first lien delayed draw term loan. \n \u2022 In March 2018, we sold our $1.0 million investment in Neustar, Inc. for net cash proceeds of $1.0 million. \n \u2022 In April 2018, we invested $3.0 million in CHA Holdings, Inc. through secured second lien debt. \n \u2022 In May 2018, our investment in TapRoot Partners, Inc. paid off, which resulted in prepayment fees of $0.5 million and success fee income of $0.4 million. In connection with the pay off, we received net cash proceeds of $22.9 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $22.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In May 2018, we invested an additional $10.0 million in an existing portfolio company, Merlin International, Inc., through secured second lien debt. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we invested an additional $7.0 million in an existing portfolio company, IA Tech, LLC, through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In July 2018, our investment in NetSmart Technologies, Inc. paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $3.7 million. \n \u2022 In July 2018, the holding company for Impact! Chemical Technologies, Inc. (\u201cImpact\u201d) merged with and into the holding company for WadeCo Specialties, Inc. (\u201cWadeCo\u201d) to form Chemical & Injection Holdings Company, LLC (\u201cChemical & Injection Holdings\u201d). Our preferred equity ownership related to WadeCo with a cost basis of $0.6 million, was converted into preferred equity ownership in the newly formed Chemical & Injection Holdings with the same cost basis. Our existing debt investments in Impact and WadeCo remained unchanged in conjunction with the merger. \n \u2022 In September 2018, we restructured our $30.0 million investment in Sunshine Media Holdings (\u201cSunshine\u201d) resulting in a $28.2 million realized loss and a new $2.0 million investment in TNCP Intermediate HoldCo, LLC. \nRefer to Note 15-Subsequent Events in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for portfolio activity occurring subsequent to September 30, 2018.\nCapital Raising\nWe have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and increases to the Credit Facility and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public equity offerings of common and preferred stock. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility's revolving period multiple times, most recently to January 2021, and currently have a total commitment amount of $190.0 million. Additionally, we issued 2.1 million shares of our 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cSeries 2024 Term Preferred Stock\u201d) at a public offering price of $25 per share, for gross proceeds of $51.8 million in September 2017, inclusive of the overallotment, and approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $17.3 million in October 2016, inclusive of the November 2016 overallotment. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2018, we sold 2,341,296 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program at a weighted-average price of $9.39 per share and raised $22.0 million of gross proceeds. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility.\nAlthough we were able to access the capital markets historically and in recent years, we believe uncertain market conditions could affect the trading price of our capital stock and thus may inhibit our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity. When our common stock trades below NAV per common share, as it has often done in previous years, our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below NAV per common share without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors, other than through sales to our then-existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering. We did not request that our stockholders approve the Company's ability to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share at our annual meeting of stockholders held on February 8, 2018. Should we decide to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share in the future, we will seek the requisite approval of our stockholders at such time.\nOn November 13, 2018, the closing market price of our common stock was $9.28, an 11.5% premium to our September 30, 2018 NAV per share of $8.32.\nRefer to Note 15-Subsequent Events in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional capital raised in connection with issuance of the 2023 Notes.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOur ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have an asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act) of at least 200% (currently) or 150% (effective April 10, 2019) on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d and our \u201csenior securities that are stock.\u201d\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the date of the Board of Directors' approval; or April 10, 2019. Under the current 200% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 10, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to certain provisions of our Credit Facility and our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d was 359.0% and our asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities that are stock\u201d was 244.4%.\nRecent Developments\nDebt Offering\nIn November 2018, we completed a public debt offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2023, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after November 1, 2020. The 2023 Notes are traded under the ticker symbol \u201cGLADD\u201d on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nDistributions\nOn October 9, 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders:\n Portfolio and Investment Activity\nIn October 2018, our investment in TWS Acquisition Corporation paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $2.0 million.\nIn October and November 2018, we invested a total of $1.6 million in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. through secured second lien debt.\nIn November 2018, we invested $2.0 million in GOBP Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a Grocery Outlet) through secured second lien debt.\nIn November 2018, our investment in Red Ventures, LLC paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $3.1 million.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nComparison of the Year Ended September 30, 2018 to the Year Ended September 30, 2017\n Investment Income\nInterest income increased by 18.6% for the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the weighted average balance outstanding on our interest-bearing portfolio and an increase in the weighted average yield on our interest-bearing portfolio. The weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended September 30, 2018, was $372.2 million, compared to $320.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $52.1 million, or 16.3%. The weighted average yield on our interest-bearing investments is based on the current stated interest rates on interest-bearing investments which increased to 11.8% for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to 11.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017, inclusive of any allowances on interest receivables made during those periods.\nAs of September 30, 2018, one portfolio company, Francis Drilling Fluids, Ltd. (\u201cFDF\u201d) was on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $26.9 million, or 6.9% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2017, two portfolio companies, Sunshine and Alloy Die Casting Co. (\u201cADC\u201d), were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $27.9 million, or 7.5% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio.\nOther income decreased by 24.9% during the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in success fees recognized year over year. For the year ended September 30, 2018, other income consisted primarily of $0.6 million in prepayment fees received, $0.5 million in dividend income, and $0.4 million in success fees recognized. For the year ended September 30, 2017, other income consisted primarily of $1.5 million in success fees recognized, $0.3 million in dividend income, and $0.3 million in prepayment fees received.\nThe following tables list the investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments at fair value during the respective years:\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Historical financial condition and results of operations and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of financial condition, results of operations or percentage relationships for any future periods. Except per share amounts, dollar amounts in the tables included herein are in thousands unless otherwise indicated.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated under the Maryland General Corporation Law on May 30, 2001. We operate as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company, and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. In addition, for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To continue to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes and obtain favorable RIC tax treatment, we must meet certain requirements, including certain minimum distribution requirements.\nWe were established for the purpose of investing in debt and equity securities of established private businesses operating in the U.S. Our investment objectives are to: (1) achieve and grow current income by investing in debt securities of established businesses that we believe will provide stable earnings and cash flow to pay expenses, make principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness and make distributions to stockholders that grow over time; and (2) provide our stockholders with long-term capital appreciation in the value of our assets by investing in equity securities of established businesses that we believe can grow over time to permit us to sell our equity investments for capital gains.

If we are participating in an investment with one or more co-investors, our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone.\nBusiness\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nIn general, our investments in debt securities have a term of no more than seven years, accrue interest at variable rates (generally based on the one-month LIBOR) and, to a lesser extent, at fixed rates. We seek debt instruments that pay interest monthly or, at a minimum, quarterly, may have a success fee or deferred interest provision and are primarily interest only, with all principal and any accrued but unpaid interest due at maturity.

Often, these equity investments occur in connection with our original investment, recapitalizing a business, or refinancing existing debt.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, we invested $67.9 million in ten new portfolio companies and extended $38.7 million of investments to existing portfolio companies. In addition, during the year ended September 30, 2018, we exited seven portfolio companies through sales and early payoffs. We received a total of $66.9 million in combined net proceeds and principal repayments from the aforementioned portfolio company exits as well as existing portfolio companies during the year ended September 30, 2018. This activity resulted in a net increase in our overall portfolio by three portfolio companies to 50 and a net increase of $16.0 million in our portfolio at cost since September 30, 2017. From our initial public offering in August 2001 through September 30, 2018, we have made 495 different loans to, or investments in, 226 companies for a total of approximately $1.8 billion, before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2018, the following significant transactions occurred:\n \u2022 In October 2017, we sold our investment in Flight Fit N Fun LLC for a realized gain of $0.6 million. In connection with the sale, we received net cash proceeds of approximately $9.4 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $7.8 million at par. \n \u2022 In October 2017, we invested $11.0 million in Applied Voice & Speech Technologies, Inc. through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In October 2017, our investment in PSC Industrial Holdings, LLC paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $3.5 million. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $7.5 million in Arc Drilling Holdings LLC through a combination of secured first lien debt and equity. \n \u2022 In November 2017, we invested $7.5 million in Gray Matter Systems, LLC through secured second lien debt.

In connection with the pay off, we received net cash proceeds of $22.9 million, including the repayment of our debt investment of $22.0 million at par. \n \u2022 In May 2018, we invested an additional $10.0 million in an existing portfolio company, Merlin International, Inc., through secured second lien debt. \n \u2022 In June 2018, we invested an additional $7.0 million in an existing portfolio company, IA Tech, LLC, through secured first lien debt. \n \u2022 In July 2018, our investment in NetSmart Technologies, Inc. paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $3.7 million. \n \u2022 In July 2018, the holding company for Impact!

(\u201cWadeCo\u201d) to form Chemical & Injection Holdings Company, LLC (\u201cChemical & Injection Holdings\u201d). Our preferred equity ownership related to WadeCo with a cost basis of $0.6 million, was converted into preferred equity ownership in the newly formed Chemical & Injection Holdings with the same cost basis. Our existing debt investments in Impact and WadeCo remained unchanged in conjunction with the merger. \n \u2022 In September 2018, we restructured our $30.0 million investment in Sunshine Media Holdings (\u201cSunshine\u201d) resulting in a $28.2 million realized loss and a new $2.0 million investment in TNCP Intermediate HoldCo, LLC. \nRefer to Note 15-Subsequent Events in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for portfolio activity occurring subsequent to September 30, 2018.\nCapital Raising\nWe have been able to meet our capital needs through extensions of and increases to the Credit Facility and by accessing the capital markets in the form of public equity offerings of common and preferred stock. We have successfully extended the Credit Facility's revolving period multiple times, most recently to January 2021, and currently have a total commitment amount of $190.0 million. Additionally, we issued 2.1 million shares of our 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (\u201cSeries 2024 Term Preferred Stock\u201d) at a public offering price of $25 per share, for gross proceeds of $51.8 million in September 2017, inclusive of the overallotment, and approximately 2.2 million shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of $17.3 million in October 2016, inclusive of the November 2016 overallotment. Additionally, during the year ended September 30, 2018, we sold 2,341,296 shares of our common stock under our at-the-market program at a weighted-average price of $9.39 per share and raised $22.0 million of gross proceeds. Refer to \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Common Stock\u201d and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Equity - Term Preferred Stock\u201d for further discussion of our common stock and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Revolving Credit Facility\u201d for further discussion of the Credit Facility.\nAlthough we were able to access the capital markets historically and in recent years, we believe uncertain market conditions could affect the trading price of our capital stock and thus may inhibit our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity. When our common stock trades below NAV per common share, as it has often done in previous years, our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the 1940 Act, which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below NAV per common share without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors, other than through sales to our then-existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering. We did not request that our stockholders approve the Company's ability to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share at our annual meeting of stockholders held on February 8, 2018. Should we decide to issue shares of common stock at a price below NAV per share in the future, we will seek the requisite approval of our stockholders at such time.\nOn November 13, 2018, the closing market price of our common stock was $9.28, an 11.5% premium to our September 30, 2018 NAV per share of $8.32.\nRefer to Note 15-Subsequent Events in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of additional capital raised in connection with issuance of the 2023 Notes.\nRegulatory Compliance\nOur ability to seek external debt financing, to the extent that it is available under current market conditions, is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the 1940 Act, which require us to have an asset coverage (as defined in Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act) of at least 200% (currently) or 150% (effective April 10, 2019) on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d and our \u201csenior securities that are stock.\u201d\nOn April 10, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a \u201crequired majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) thereof, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. As a result, the Company's asset coverage requirements for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective one year after the date of the Board of Directors' approval; or April 10, 2019. Under the current 200% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $1.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Starting from April 10, 2019, under the 150% asset coverage standard, we may borrow debt or issue senior securities in the amount of $2.00 for every $1.00 of equity in the Company. Notwithstanding the modified asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act described above, we are separately subject to a minimum asset coverage requirement of 200% with respect to certain provisions of our Credit Facility and our Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock.\nAs of September 30, 2018, our asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities representing indebtedness\u201d was 359.0% and our asset coverage on our \u201csenior securities that are stock\u201d was 244.4%.\nRecent Developments\nDebt Offering\nIn November 2018, we completed a public debt offering of $57.5 million aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d), inclusive of the overallotment, for net proceeds of $55.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses borne by us. The Notes will mature on November 1, 2023, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company's option on or after November 1, 2020. The 2023 Notes are traded under the ticker symbol \u201cGLADD\u201d on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nDistributions\nOn October 9, 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Record Date\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution\nper Common\nShare </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution\nper Series\n2024 Term\nPreferred\nShare </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> October 19, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> November 20, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>November 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 20, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.125 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total for the Quarter </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.375 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Portfolio and Investment Activity\nIn October 2018, our investment in TWS Acquisition Corporation paid off at par for net cash proceeds of $2.0 million.\nIn October and November 2018, we invested a total of $1.6 million in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. through secured second lien debt.\nIn November 2018, we invested $2.0 million in GOBP Holdings, Inc.

ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the weighted average balance outstanding on our interest-bearing portfolio and an increase in the weighted average yield on our interest-bearing portfolio. The weighted average principal balance of our interest-bearing investment portfolio during the year ended September 30, 2018, was $372.2 million, compared to $320.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $52.1 million, or 16.3%. The weighted average yield on our interest-bearing investments is based on the current stated interest rates on interest-bearing investments which increased to 11.8% for the year ended September 30, 2018 compared to 11.6% for the year ended September 30, 2017, inclusive of any allowances on interest receivables made during those periods.\nAs of September 30, 2018, one portfolio company, Francis Drilling Fluids, Ltd. (\u201cFDF\u201d) was on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $26.9 million, or 6.9% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio. As of September 30, 2017, two portfolio companies, Sunshine and Alloy Die Casting Co. (\u201cADC\u201d), were on non-accrual status, with an aggregate debt cost basis of approximately $27.9 million, or 7.5% of the cost basis of all debt investments in our portfolio.\nOther income decreased by 24.9% during the year ended September 30, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in success fees recognized year over year. For the year ended September 30, 2018, other income consisted primarily of $0.6 million in prepayment fees received, $0.5 million in dividend income, and $0.4 million in success fees recognized. For the year ended September 30, 2017, other income consisted primarily of $1.5 million in success fees recognized, $0.3 million in dividend income, and $0.3 million in prepayment fees received.\nThe following tables list the investment income for our five largest portfolio company investments at fair value during the respective years:\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of September 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30, 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio Company\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Portfolio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Investment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total\nInvestment\nIncome </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IA Tech, LLC\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NetFortris Corp.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lignetics, Inc.\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td>"}
