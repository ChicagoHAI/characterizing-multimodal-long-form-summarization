Our precision solutions are integral to the manufacture and operation of most machines and mechanical systems, reduce wear to moving parts, facilitate proper power transmission and reduce damage and energy loss caused by friction. While we manufacture products in all major bearing categories, we focus primarily on the higher end of the bearing market where we believe our value added manufacturing and engineering capabilities enable us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and enhance profitability. We believe our unique expertise has enabled us to garner leading positions in many of the product markets in which we primarily compete. With 37 facilities, of which 33 are manufacturing facilities in five countries, we have been able to significantly broaden our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach. We have a fiscal year consisting of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. Based on this policy fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks; fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks. We currently operate under four reportable business segments: Plain Bearings; Roller Bearings; Ball Bearings; and Engineered Products. The following further describes these reportable segments:\nPlain Bearings. Plain bearings are produced with either self-lubricating or metal-to-metal designs and consists of several sub-classes, including rod end bearings, spherical plain bearings and journal bearings. Unlike ball bearings, which are used in high-speed rotational applications, plain bearings are primarily used to rectify inevitable misalignments in various mechanical components.\nRoller Bearings. Roller bearings are anti-friction bearings that use rollers instead of balls. We manufacture four basic types of roller bearings: heavy duty needle roller bearings with inner rings, tapered roller bearings, track rollers and aircraft roller bearings.\nBall Bearings. We manufacture four basic types of ball bearings: high precision aerospace, airframe control, thin section and commercial ball bearings which are used in high-speed rotational applications.\nEngineered Products. Engineered Products consists of highly engineered hydraulics, fasteners, collets and precision components used in aerospace, marine and industrial applications\nPurchasers of bearings and engineered products include industrial equipment and machinery manufacturers, producers of commercial and military aerospace equipment such as missiles and radar systems, agricultural machinery manufacturers, construction, energy, mining and specialized equipment manufacturers, marine products, automotive and commercial truck manufacturers. The markets for our products are cyclical, and we have endeavored to mitigate this cyclicality by entering into sole-source relationships and long-term purchase agreements, through diversification across multiple market segments within the aerospace and industrial segments, by increasing sales to the aftermarket and by focusing on developing highly customized solutions.\nCurrently, our strategy is built around maintaining our role as a leading manufacturer of precision bearings and components through the following efforts:\nTable 61: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Developing innovative solutions. By leveraging our design and manufacturing expertise and our extensive customer relationships, we continue to develop new products for markets in which there are substantial growth opportunities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Expanding customer base and penetrating end markets. We continually seek opportunities to access new customers, geographic locations and bearing platforms with existing products or profitable new product opportunities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Increasing aftermarket sales. We believe that increasing our aftermarket sales of replacement parts will further enhance the continuity and predictability of our revenues and enhance our profitability. Such sales included sales to third party distributors, sales to OEMs for replacement products and aftermarket services. We will increase the percentage of our revenues derived from the replacement market by continuing to implement several initiatives. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Pursuing selective acquisitions. The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We believe that there will continue to be consolidation within the industry that may present us with acquisition opportunities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have demonstrated expertise in acquiring and integrating bearing and precision engineered component manufacturers that have complementary products or distribution channels and provide significant potential for margin enhancement. We have consistently increased the profitability of acquired businesses through a process of methods and systems improvement coupled with the introduction of complementary and proprietary new products. Since October 1992 we have completed 24 acquisitions, which have broadened our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach.\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following items highlight the most recent significant events:\nTable 66: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, subsequent to the close of the fiscal 2015 year, we acquired Sargent for $500.0 million financed through a combination of cash on hand and senior debt. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, Sargent is a leader in precision-engineered products, solutions and repairs for aircraft airframes and engines, rotorcraft, submarines and land vehicles. Sargent manufactures sells, and services hydraulic valves and actuators, specialty bearings, specialty fasteners, seal rings & alignment joints, and precision components under leading brands including Kahr Bearing, Airtomic, Sonic Industries, Sargent Controls and Sargent Aerospace & Defense. Annual sales are approximately $195.0 million and the company has over 750 employees in six facilities in three countries. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In connection with the Sargent acquisition on April 24, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) and related Guarantee, Pledge Agreement and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides RBCA, as Borrower, with (a) a $200.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (b) a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Term Loan Facility, the Facilities\u201d). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we reached a decision to consolidate the manufacturing capacity of the United Kingdom (U.K.) facility into our other manufacturing facilities. This decision was based on our intent to better align manufacturing abilities and product development. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired the net assets of TCI for approximately $3.9 million. Located in San Diego, California, TCI is an FAA certified aircraft gas turbine repair station and manufacturer of precision components for aerospace markets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutlook\nWe ended fiscal 2016 with a backlog of $346.4 million compared to $209.6 million for the same period last fiscal year. Our net sales increased 34.2% year over year due to a 59.6% growth in the aerospace markets and 2.9% in the industrial markets. We expect to see growth in the industrial markets resulting from the overall economic improvement of the general industrial markets and continued growth in aerospace tied to the aircraft build rates and positive movement in defense spending. Our internal goal is to grow our industrial business at a pace of 2.0 to 2.5 times Gross Domestic Product ( GDP\u201d) on a compounded basis.\nManagement believes that operating cash flows and available credit under the credit facilities will provide adequate resources to fund internal and external growth initiatives for the foreseeable future. As of April 2, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 million of which approximately $29.3 million was cash held by our foreign operations. We expect that our undistributed foreign earnings will be re-invested indefinitely for working capital, internal growth and acquisitions for and by our foreign entities.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue is generated primarily from sales of products to the industrial market and the aerospace markets. Sales are often made pursuant to sole-source relationships, long-term agreements and purchase orders with our customers. We recognize revenues principally from the sale of products at the point of passage of title, which is at the time of shipment, except for certain customers for which it occurs when the products reach their destination.\nWe also recognize revenue on a Ship-In-Place basis for two customers who have required that we hold the product after final production is complete. In this case, a written agreement has been executed (at the customer's request) whereby the customer accepts the risk of loss for product that is invoiced under the Ship-In-Place arrangement. For each transaction for which revenue is recognized under a Ship-In-Place arrangement, all final manufacturing inspections have been completed and customer acceptance has been obtained. In the twelve months ended April 2, 2016, 2.1% of our total net sales was recognized under Ship-In-Place transactions.\nSales to the industrial market accounted for 34% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016. Sales to the aerospace and defense markets accounted for 66% of our net sales for the same period.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAftermarket sales of replacement parts for existing equipment platforms and aftermarket services represented approximately 46% of our net sales for fiscal 2016. We continue to develop our OEM relationships which have established us as a leading supplier on many important industrial, aerospace and defense platforms. Over the past several years, we have experienced increased demand from the replacement parts market, particularly within the diversified industrial sectors; one of our business strategies has been to increase the proportion of sales derived from this sector and from aerospace and defense. We believe these activities increase the stability of our revenue base, strengthen our brand identity and provide multiple paths for revenue growth.\nApproximately 13% of our net sales were generated by our international facilities for fiscal 2016, compared to 16% for fiscal 2015. We expect that this proportion will increase as we seek to increase our penetration of foreign markets. Our top ten customers generated 33% and 28% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Out of the 33% of net sales generated by our top ten customers during the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016, 20% of net sales were generated by our top four customers compared to 15% for the comparable period last fiscal year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of sales includes employee compensation and benefits, raw materials, outside processing, depreciation of manufacturing machinery and equipment, supplies and manufacturing overhead.\nApproximately 12% to 25% of our costs, depending on product mix, are attributable to raw materials and purchased components, a majority of which are related to steel and related products. During fiscal 2016, steel prices remained flat with slight variances up and down throughout the fiscal year. When we do experience raw material inflation, we offset these cost increases by changing our buying patterns, expanding our vendor network and passing through price increases when possible. The overall impact on raw material costs for this fiscal year was not material as a percent change on a year over year basis.\nWe monitor gross margin performance through a process of monthly operation reviews with all our divisions. We develop new products to target certain markets allied to our strategies by first understanding volume levels and product pricing and then constructing manufacturing strategies to achieve defined margin objectives. We only pursue product lines where we believe that the developed manufacturing process will yield the targeted margins. Management monitors gross margins of all product lines on a monthly basis to determine which manufacturing processes or prices should be adjusted.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nResults of Operations\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Organic net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>424.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales by recent acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>597.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income per common share: Diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average common shares: Diluted </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,508,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,385,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $152.2 million or 34.2% for fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. This increase was mainly the result of a 59.6% increase in net sales to the aerospace markets combined with a 2.9% increase in industrial net sales of $3.0 million.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOrganic net sales decreased 4.6% compared to the prior fiscal year. Excluding a negative foreign exchange impact, organic net sales decreased 3.9%. Our aerospace markets decreased 0.6% mainly driven by defense and the industrial markets decreased 9.5% mainly driven by oil and gas.\nNet income increased by $5.7 million to $63.9 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the after tax impact of $3.4 million in costs and $4.8 million in inventory purchase accounting associated with the Sargent acquisition, $0.7 million of costs associated with integration and restructuring, litigation reserve of $1.1 million and $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt offset $0.2 million of discrete tax benefit, net income would have been $73.8 million.\nGross Margin\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Margin </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>218.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin increased $48.7 million or 28.6% for fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last fiscal year.

Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.6% compared to 31.1% for fiscal 2015. In addition to discrete items, the effective income tax rates are different from the U.S. statutory rate due to a special manufacturing deduction in the U.S. and foreign income taxed at lower rates which decrease the rate, and state income taxes which increase the rate. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 of 32.6% includes discrete items of $0.2 million which are comprised substantially of unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing, the expiration of statutes of limitations and an item associated with federal legislation reinstating the U.S. research credit. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 without these discrete items would have been 32.8%. The effective income tax rate of 31.1% for fiscal 2015 includes discrete items in the amount of $5.5 million which are substantially comprised items associated with the consolidation and restructuring of the Company's U.K. manufacturing facility and unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 without these discrete items would have been 33.8%.\nSegment Information\nWe have four reportable product segments: Plain Bearings, Roller Bearings, Ball Bearings and Engineered Products. In fiscal 2016 we integrated the Sargent businesses into our Plain Bearings and Engineered Products segments (see Notes 3 and 18). We use net sales and gross margin as the primary measurement to assess the financial performance of each reportable segment. The presentation of segment net sales includes a reconciliation to adjust for the effects of any acquisitions made in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nPlain Bearing Segment:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Organic net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales by recent acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>% of segment net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $40.3 million, or 17.5%, for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the $42.3 million impact of acquisition volume from Sargent, net sales decreased $2.0 million, or 0.8%, compared to fiscal 2015. The net sales decrease of $2.0 million for this segment was mostly attributable to a net sales increase to the aerospace sector of $2.5 million offset by a net sales decrease of $2.6 million to the industrial sector, driven mainly by oil and gas, general industrial distribution and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.9 million.\nGross margin increased $17.4 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the $18.5 million impact from the Sargent acquisition, the segment achieved a gross margin of $85.0 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million, over fiscal 2015. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.6 million and product mix of $0.5 million.\nRoller Bearing Segment:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Organic net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales by recent acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>% of segment net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales decreased $16.7 million, or 12.9%, compared to fiscal 2015.

Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 31.1% compared to 31.4% for fiscal 2014. In addition to discrete items, the effective income tax rates are different from the U.S. statutory rate due to a special manufacturing deduction in the U.S. and foreign income taxed at lower rates which decrease the rate, and state income taxes and an officers' compensation adjustment which increase the rate. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 of 31.1% includes discrete items of $5.5 million which are comprised substantially of items associated with the consolidation and restructuring of the Company's U.K. manufacturing facility and unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 without these discrete items would have been 33.8%. The effective income tax rate of 31.4% for fiscal 2014 includes discrete items in the amount of $1.7 million which are substantially comprised of the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2014 without these discrete items would have been 33.3%.\nSegment Information\nWe have four reportable product segments: Plain Bearings, Roller Bearings, Ball Bearings and Engineered Products.

Our capital requirements include manufacturing equipment and materials. In addition, we have historically fueled our growth in part through acquisitions. We have historically met our working capital, capital expenditure requirements and acquisition funding needs through our net cash flows provided by operations, various debt arrangements and sale of equity to investors. We believe that operating cash flows and available credit under the credit facilities will provide adequate resources to fund internal and external growth initiatives for the foreseeable future.\nOur ability to meet future working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, particularly interest rates, cyclical changes in our end markets and prices for steel and our ability to pass through price increases on a timely basis, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, future acquisitions could have a significant impact on our liquidity position and our need for additional funds.\t\nFrom time to time we evaluate our existing facilities and operations and their strategic importance to us. If we determine that a given facility or operation does not have future strategic importance, we may sell, partially or completely, relocate production lines, consolidate or otherwise dispose of those operations. Although we believe our operations would not be materially impaired by such dispositions, relocations or consolidations, we could incur significant cash or non-cash charges in connection with them.\nLiquidity\nAs of April 2, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 million of which approximately $29.3 million was cash held by our foreign operations. We expect that our undistributed foreign earnings will be re-invested indefinitely for working capital, internal growth and acquisitions for and by our foreign entities.\nOn May 16, 2014, our Board declared a special cash dividend to shareholders of $2.00 per common share or a total of approximately $46.0 million. The special dividend was payable on June 13, 2014, to shareholders of record on May 30, 2014. The ex-dividend date was May 28, 2014. The Board opted for a special dividend payment, rather than a regular reoccurring dividend, to allow greater flexibility given our pipeline of attractive growth opportunities. The Board will, however, consider the use of additional special cash dividends in the future as circumstances warrant.\nNew Credit Facility\nIn connection with the Sargent acquisition on April 24, 2015, the Company entered into the New Credit Agreement and related Guarantee, Pledge Agreement and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer and the other lenders party thereto and terminated the JP Morgan Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides RBCA, as Borrower, with (a) a $200 million Term Loan and (b) a $350 million Revolver and together with the Term Loan (the Facilities\u201d).\nAmounts outstanding under the Facilities generally bear interest at (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) Wells Fargo's prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1% or (b) LIBOR rate plus a specified margin, depending on the type of borrowing being made. The applicable margin is based on the Company's consolidated ratio of total net debt to consolidated EBITDA from time to time. Currently, our margin is 0.5% for base rate loans and 1.5% for LIBOR rate loans. As of April 2, 2016, there was $169.0 million outstanding under the Revolver and $192.5 million outstanding under the Term Loan, offset by $5.8 million in debt issuance costs (original amount was $7.1 million).\nThe New Credit Agreement requires us to comply with various covenants, including among other things, financial covenants to maintain the following: (1) a ratio of consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA, not to exceed 3.50 to 1; and (2) a consolidated interest coverage ratio not to exceed 2.75 to 1. The New Credit Agreement allows us to, among other things, make distributions to shareholders, repurchase our stock, incur other debt or liens, or acquire or dispose of assets provided that we comply with certain requirements and limitations of the agreement. As of April 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nOur obligations under the New Credit Agreement are secured as well as providing for a pledge of substantially all of our assets. We and certain of our subsidiaries have also entered into a Guarantee to guarantee our obligations under the New Credit Agreement.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately $3.3 million of the Revolver is being utilized to provide letters of credit to secure RBCA's obligations relating to certain insurance programs. As of April 2, 2016, RBCA has the ability to borrow up to an additional $177.7 million under the Revolver.\nPrior Credit Facility\nOn November 30, 2010, we and RBCA terminated the previous KeyBank Credit Agreement and the related credit, security and ancillary agreements, and entered into a new credit agreement (the JP Morgan Credit Agreement\u201d) and related security and guaranty agreements with certain banks, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. and KeyBank National Association as Co-Lead Arrangers and Joint Lead Book Runners. The JP Morgan Credit Agreement provided RBCA with a $150.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility which could be increased by up to $100.0 million, in increments of $25.0 million, under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions (including the receipt from one or more lenders of the additional commitment).\nAmounts outstanding under the JP Morgan Credit Agreement generally bore interest at the prime rate, or LIBOR plus a specified margin, depending on the type of borrowing being made. The applicable margin was based on our consolidated ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA from time to time. As of March 28, 2015, our margin was 0.5% for prime rate loans and 1.5% for LIBOR rate loans.\nThe JP Morgan Credit Agreement required us to comply with various covenants, including among other things, financial covenants to maintain the following: (1) a ratio of consolidated net debt to adjusted EBITDA not to exceed 3.25 to 1; and (2) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio not to exceed 1.5 to 1. As of March 28, 2015, we were in compliance with all such covenants. The JP Morgan Credit Agreement allowed us to, among other things, make distributions to shareholders, repurchase our stock, incur other debt or liens, or acquire or dispose of assets provided that we complied with certain requirements and limitations of the credit agreement. The JP Morgan Credit Agreement was terminated and replaced by the New Credit Agreement discussed above.\nOther Notes Payable\nOn October 1, 2012, Schaublin purchased the land and building, which it currently occupies and had been leasing, for 14.1 million CHF (approximately $15.0 million). Schaublin obtained a 20 year fixed rate mortgage for 9.3 million CHF (approximately $9.9 million) at an interest rate of 2.9%. The balance of the purchase price of 4.8 million CHF (approximately $5.1 million) was paid from cash on hand. As of April 2, 2016, the balance on this mortgage was 7.7 million CHF, or $8.0 million.\nCash Flows\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activities:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>71.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(520.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(502.2 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>349.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(Decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(86.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(90.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2016 we generated cash of $83.4 million from operating activities compared to $71.8 million for fiscal 2015. The increase of $11.6 million for fiscal 2016 was mainly the result of an increase in net income of $5.7 million and addition of non-cash charges of $7.5 million, offset by an unfavorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following chart summarizes the (unfavorable) favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of ($1.6) million for fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015 and $18.6 million for fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts receivable </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Inventory </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Prepaid expenses and other current assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other non-current assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accounts payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued expenses and other current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other non-current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total change in operating assets and liabilities: </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2016, we used $520.1 million for investing activities as compared to $17.9 for fiscal 2015. The increase of cash used in investing activities of $502.2 million is primarily attributable to the $500.0 million used to finance the acquisition of Sargent.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we generated $349.8 million from financing activities compared to using $46.0 million for fiscal 2015. This increase in cash generated was primarily attributable to the $225.0 million revolving credit facility and $200.0 million proceeds from the term loan associated with the acquisition of Sargent in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nIn the fiscal year ended March 28, 2015 we generated cash of $71.8 million from operating activities compared to $48.0 million for fiscal 2014. The increase of $23.8 million for fiscal 2015 was mainly a result of the addition of non-cash charges of $7.2 million and a favorable net change in operating assets and liabilities of $18.6 million, offset by a decrease in net income of $2.0 million. The favorable impact of the non-cash charges was primarily due to the consolidation and restructuring of the U.K. facility for $5.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The favorable change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of cash being used for working capital items\nIn fiscal 2015, we used $17.9 million for investing activities as compared to $47.1 million for fiscal 2014. The decrease of cash used in investing activities of $29.2 million is primarily attributable to the proceeds received on the sale of short-term investments of $2.4 million offset by acquisitions in fiscal 2014 of $17.6 million.\nIn fiscal 2015, we used $46.0 million for financing activities compared to providing $3.8 million for fiscal 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the $46.0 million dividend paid to shareholders in the first quarter of fiscal 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 were $20.9 million. We expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $21.0 to $23.0 million during fiscal 2017 in connection with our existing business. We have funded our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures, and expect to fund fiscal 2017 capital expenditures, principally through existing cash and internally generated funds. We may also make substantial additional capital expenditures in connection with acquisitions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions and interest rates, as well as actions by third parties and other factors, may cause these estimates to change. Because these estimates are necessarily subjective, our actual payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to product returns, bad debts, inventories, recoverability of intangible assets, income taxes, financing operations, pensions and other postretirement benefits and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements as amended by Staff Accounting Bulletin 104,\u201d we recognize revenues principally from the sale of products at the point of passage of title, which is at the time of shipment, except for certain customers for which it occurs when the products reach their destination.\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also recognize revenue on a Ship-In-Place basis for two customers who have required that we hold the product after final production is complete. In this case, a written agreement has been executed (at the customer's request) whereby the customer accepts the risk of loss for product that is invoiced under the Ship-In-Place arrangement. For each transaction for which revenue is recognized under a Ship-In-Place arrangement, all final manufacturing inspections have been completed and customer acceptance has been obtained. In the twelve months ended April 2, 2016, 2.1% of our total net sales was recognized under Ship-In-Place transactions.\nAccounts Receivable. We are required to estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable, which requires a considerable amount of judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables, including the current credit-worthiness of each customer. Changes in required reserves may occur in the future as conditions in the marketplace change.\nInventory. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We account for inventory under a full absorption method. We record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon past sales history and forecasted plans to sell our inventories. The physical condition, including age and quality, of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from actual requirements if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets. Goodwill (representing the excess of the amount paid to acquire a company over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired) and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets are not amortized but instead is tested for impairment annually, or when events or circumstances indicate that its value may have declined. Separate tests are performed for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets. We apply a qualitative test of impairment on the indefinite lived intangible assets. This is done by assessing the existence of events or circumstances which would make it more likely than not that impairment is present. No such factors were identified during our current year analysis. The determination of any goodwill impairment is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. Second, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill over the goodwill's implied fair value. The Company the income approach (discounted cash flow method) in testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method used to estimate fair value include discount rates, revenue growth rates, terminal growth rates and cash flow projections. Discount rates, growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ( WACC\u201d). The WACC considers market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business. Terminal growth rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant WACC and long-term growth rates. The Company has determined that, to date, no impairment of goodwill exists and fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value in total by approximately 74%. The fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value by a minimum of 37% at each of the four reporting units. The Company performs the annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Although no changes are expected, if the actual results of the Company are less favorable than the assumptions the Company makes regarding estimated cash flows, the Company may be required to record an impairment charge in the future.\nIncome Taxes. As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate. This process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered, and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not more than likely, we are required to establish a valuation allowance. If a valuation allowance is established or increased during any period, we are required to include this amount as an expense within the tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, accrual for uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recognized against net deferred tax assets.\nPension Plan and Postretirement Health Care. We have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering union employees in our Heim division plant in Fairfield, Connecticut, our Bremen subsidiary plant in Plymouth, Indiana and former union employees of our Tyson subsidiary in Glasgow, Kentucky and Nice subsidiary in Kulpsville, Pennsylvania.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur pension plan funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Plan obligations and annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by us including assumptions about employee demographics, retirement age, compensation levels, pay rates, turnover, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate and the amount and timing of claims. Each plan assumption reflects our best estimate of the plan's future experience. The most sensitive assumption in the determination of plan obligations for pensions is the discount rate. The discount rate that we use for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long-term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency. The discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from 4.10% at March 29, 2014, to 3.40% at March 28, 2015 and April 2, 2016. In developing the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, a building block approach was used in which rates of return in excess of inflation were considered separately for equity securities and debt securities. The excess returns were weighted by the representative target allocation and added along with an appropriate rate of inflation to develop the overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our pension plan was 7.00% in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nLowering the discount rate assumption used to determine net periodic pension cost by 1.00% (from 3.40% to 2.40%) would have increased our pension expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately $0.4 million. Increasing the discount rate assumption used to determine net periodic pension cost by 1.00% (from 3.40% to 4.40%) would have decreased our pension expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately $0.3 million.\nLowering the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our pension plan by 1.00% (from 7.00% to 6.00%) would have increased our pension expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately $0.2 million. Increasing the expected long-term rate of return on the assets of our pension plan by 1.00% (from 7.00% to 8.00%) would have reduced our pension expense for fiscal 2016 by approximately $0.2 million.\nLowering the discount rate assumption used to determine the funded status as of April 2, 2016 by 1.00% (from 3.40% to 2.40%) would have increased the projected benefit obligation of our pension plan by approximately $3.2 million. Increasing the discount rate assumption used to determine the funded status as of April 2, 2016 by 1.00% (from 3.40% to 4.40%) would have reduced the projected benefit obligation of our pension plan by approximately $2.7 million.\nOur investment program objective is to achieve a rate of return on plan assets which will fund the plan liabilities and provide for required benefits while avoiding undue exposure to risk to the plan and increases in funding requirements. Our long-term target allocation of plan assets is 70% equity and 30% fixed income investments.\nStock-Based Compensation. We recognize compensation cost relating to all share-based payment transactions in the financial statements based upon the grant-date fair value of the instruments issued over the requisite service period.\nThe fair value for our options was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 2,\n2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 28,\n2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>March 29,\n2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend yield </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected weighted-average life (yrs.) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.60 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.04 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected volatility </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility. Because our options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options.\nImpact of Inflation, Changes in Prices of Raw Materials and Interest Rate Fluctuations\nTo date, inflation in the economy as a whole has not significantly affected our operations. However, we purchase steel at market prices, which fluctuate as a result of supply and demand in the marketplace. To date, we have generally been able to pass through these price increases through price increases on our products, the assessment of steel surcharges on our customers or entry into long-term agreements with our customers which often contain escalator provisions tied to our invoiced price of steel. However, even if we are able to pass these steel surcharges or price increases to our customers, there may be a time lag of up to 3 months or more between the time a price increase goes into effect and our ability to implement surcharges or price increases, particularly for orders already in our backlog. As a result, our gross margin percentage may decline, and we may not be able to implement other price increases for our products. We offset these cost increases by changing our buying patterns, expanding our vendor network and passing through price increases. The overall impact on costs for the year was immaterial.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompetitive pressures and the terms of certain of our long-term contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases, particularly during periods of high inflation. Our principal raw material is 440c and 52100 wire and rod steel (types of stainless and chrome steel), which has historically been readily available. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to a supply shortage. We maintain multiple sources for raw materials including steel and have various supplier agreements. Through sole-source arrangements, supplier agreements and pricing, we have been able to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in raw material prices.\nOur suppliers and sources of raw materials are based in the U.S., Europe and Asia. We believe that our sources are adequate for our needs in the foreseeable future, that there exist alternative suppliers for our raw materials and that in most cases readily available alternative materials can be used for most of our raw materials.", "summary": "The report provides an analysis of the company's financial position and operations.

7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\t\nThe financial and business analysis below provides information which we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. This financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. All references to Notes\u201d in this Item 7 refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion and certain other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute forward-looking statements\u201d under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which we operate and our beliefs and assumptions. Any statements contained herein (including without limitation statements to the effect that we or our management believes,\u201d expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans\u201d and similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, those set forth, or incorporated by reference, below under the heading Cautionary Statements.\u201d We do not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n 20 \nOverview\nWe are a well-known international manufacturer of highly engineered precision bearings and components. Our precision solutions are integral to the manufacture and operation of most machines and mechanical systems, reduce wear to moving parts, facilitate proper power transmission and reduce damage and energy loss caused by friction. While we manufacture products in all major bearing categories, we focus primarily on the higher end of the bearing market where we believe our value added manufacturing and engineering capabilities enable us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and enhance profitability. We believe our unique expertise has enabled us to garner leading positions in many of the product markets in which we primarily compete. With 37 facilities, of which 33 are manufacturing facilities in five countries, we have been able to significantly broaden our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach. We have a fiscal year consisting of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. Based on this policy fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks; fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks. We currently operate under four reportable business segments: Plain Bearings; Roller Bearings; Ball Bearings; and Engineered Products. The following further describes these reportable segments:\nPlain Bearings. Plain bearings are produced with either self-lubricating or metal-to-metal designs and consists of several sub-classes, including rod end bearings, spherical plain bearings and journal bearings. Unlike ball bearings, which are used in high-speed rotational applications, plain bearings are primarily used to rectify inevitable misalignments in various mechanical components.\nRoller Bearings. Roller bearings are anti-friction bearings that use rollers instead of balls. We manufacture four basic types of roller bearings: heavy duty needle roller bearings with inner rings, tapered roller bearings, track rollers and aircraft roller bearings.\nBall Bearings. We manufacture four basic types of ball bearings: high precision aerospace, airframe control, thin section and commercial ball bearings which are used in high-speed rotational applications.\nEngineered Products. Engineered Products consists of highly engineered hydraulics, fasteners, collets and precision components used in aerospace, marine and industrial applications\nPurchasers of bearings and engineered products include industrial equipment and machinery manufacturers, producers of commercial and military aerospace equipment such as missiles and radar systems, agricultural machinery manufacturers, construction, energy, mining and specialized equipment manufacturers, marine products, automotive and commercial truck manufacturers. The markets for our products are cyclical, and we have endeavored to mitigate this cyclicality by entering into sole-source relationships and long-term purchase agreements, through diversification across multiple market segments within the aerospace and industrial segments, by increasing sales to the aftermarket and by focusing on developing highly customized solutions.\nCurrently, our strategy is built around maintaining our role as a leading manufacturer of precision bearings and components through the following efforts:\n \u00b7 Developing innovative solutions. By leveraging our design and manufacturing expertise and our extensive customer relationships, we continue to develop new products for markets in which there are substantial growth opportunities. \n \u00b7 Expanding customer base and penetrating end markets. We continually seek opportunities to access new customers, geographic locations and bearing platforms with existing products or profitable new product opportunities. \n \u00b7 Increasing aftermarket sales. We believe that increasing our aftermarket sales of replacement parts will further enhance the continuity and predictability of our revenues and enhance our profitability. Such sales included sales to third party distributors, sales to OEMs for replacement products and aftermarket services. We will increase the percentage of our revenues derived from the replacement market by continuing to implement several initiatives. \n \u00b7 Pursuing selective acquisitions. The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We believe that there will continue to be consolidation within the industry that may present us with acquisition opportunities. \nWe have demonstrated expertise in acquiring and integrating bearing and precision engineered component manufacturers that have complementary products or distribution channels and provide significant potential for margin enhancement. We have consistently increased the profitability of acquired businesses through a process of methods and systems improvement coupled with the introduction of complementary and proprietary new products. Since October 1992 we have completed 24 acquisitions, which have broadened our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach.\n 21 \nThe following items highlight the most recent significant events:\n \u00b7 In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, subsequent to the close of the fiscal 2015 year, we acquired Sargent for $500.0 million financed through a combination of cash on hand and senior debt. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, Sargent is a leader in precision-engineered products, solutions and repairs for aircraft airframes and engines, rotorcraft, submarines and land vehicles. Sargent manufactures sells, and services hydraulic valves and actuators, specialty bearings, specialty fasteners, seal rings & alignment joints, and precision components under leading brands including Kahr Bearing, Airtomic, Sonic Industries, Sargent Controls and Sargent Aerospace & Defense. Annual sales are approximately $195.0 million and the company has over 750 employees in six facilities in three countries. \n \u00b7 In connection with the Sargent acquisition on April 24, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) and related Guarantee, Pledge Agreement and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides RBCA, as Borrower, with (a) a $200.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (b) a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Term Loan Facility, the Facilities\u201d). \n \u00b7 In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we reached a decision to consolidate the manufacturing capacity of the United Kingdom (U.K.) facility into our other manufacturing facilities. This decision was based on our intent to better align manufacturing abilities and product development. \n \u00b7 In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired the net assets of TCI for approximately $3.9 million. Located in San Diego, California, TCI is an FAA certified aircraft gas turbine repair station and manufacturer of precision components for aerospace markets. \nOutlook\nWe ended fiscal 2016 with a backlog of $346.4 million compared to $209.6 million for the same period last fiscal year. Our net sales increased 34.2% year over year due to a 59.6% growth in the aerospace markets and 2.9% in the industrial markets. We expect to see growth in the industrial markets resulting from the overall economic improvement of the general industrial markets and continued growth in aerospace tied to the aircraft build rates and positive movement in defense spending. Our internal goal is to grow our industrial business at a pace of 2.0 to 2.5 times Gross Domestic Product ( GDP\u201d) on a compounded basis.\nManagement believes that operating cash flows and available credit under the credit facilities will provide adequate resources to fund internal and external growth initiatives for the foreseeable future. As of April 2, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 million of which approximately $29.3 million was cash held by our foreign operations. We expect that our undistributed foreign earnings will be re-invested indefinitely for working capital, internal growth and acquisitions for and by our foreign entities.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue is generated primarily from sales of products to the industrial market and the aerospace markets. Sales are often made pursuant to sole-source relationships, long-term agreements and purchase orders with our customers. We recognize revenues principally from the sale of products at the point of passage of title, which is at the time of shipment, except for certain customers for which it occurs when the products reach their destination.\nWe also recognize revenue on a Ship-In-Place basis for two customers who have required that we hold the product after final production is complete. In this case, a written agreement has been executed (at the customer's request) whereby the customer accepts the risk of loss for product that is invoiced under the Ship-In-Place arrangement. For each transaction for which revenue is recognized under a Ship-In-Place arrangement, all final manufacturing inspections have been completed and customer acceptance has been obtained. In the twelve months ended April 2, 2016, 2.1% of our total net sales was recognized under Ship-In-Place transactions.\nSales to the industrial market accounted for 34% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016. Sales to the aerospace and defense markets accounted for 66% of our net sales for the same period.\n 22 \nAftermarket sales of replacement parts for existing equipment platforms and aftermarket services represented approximately 46% of our net sales for fiscal 2016. We continue to develop our OEM relationships which have established us as a leading supplier on many important industrial, aerospace and defense platforms. Over the past several years, we have experienced increased demand from the replacement parts market, particularly within the diversified industrial sectors; one of our business strategies has been to increase the proportion of sales derived from this sector and from aerospace and defense. We believe these activities increase the stability of our revenue base, strengthen our brand identity and provide multiple paths for revenue growth.\nApproximately 13% of our net sales were generated by our international facilities for fiscal 2016, compared to 16% for fiscal 2015. We expect that this proportion will increase as we seek to increase our penetration of foreign markets. Our top ten customers generated 33% and 28% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Out of the 33% of net sales generated by our top ten customers during the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016, 20% of net sales were generated by our top four customers compared to 15% for the comparable period last fiscal year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of sales includes employee compensation and benefits, raw materials, outside processing, depreciation of manufacturing machinery and equipment, supplies and manufacturing overhead.\nApproximately 12% to 25% of our costs, depending on product mix, are attributable to raw materials and purchased components, a majority of which are related to steel and related products. During fiscal 2016, steel prices remained flat with slight variances up and down throughout the fiscal year. When we do experience raw material inflation, we offset these cost increases by changing our buying patterns, expanding our vendor network and passing through price increases when possible. The overall impact on raw material costs for this fiscal year was not material as a percent change on a year over year basis.\nWe monitor gross margin performance through a process of monthly operation reviews with all our divisions. We develop new products to target certain markets allied to our strategies by first understanding volume levels and product pricing and then constructing manufacturing strategies to achieve defined margin objectives. We only pursue product lines where we believe that the developed manufacturing process will yield the targeted margins. Management monitors gross margins of all product lines on a monthly basis to determine which manufacturing processes or prices should be adjusted.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nResults of Operations\n\nNet sales increased $152.2 million or 34.2% for fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015. This increase was mainly the result of a 59.6% increase in net sales to the aerospace markets combined with a 2.9% increase in industrial net sales of $3.0 million.\n 23 \nOrganic net sales decreased 4.6% compared to the prior fiscal year. Excluding a negative foreign exchange impact, organic net sales decreased 3.9%. Our aerospace markets decreased 0.6% mainly driven by defense and the industrial markets decreased 9.5% mainly driven by oil and gas.\nNet income increased by $5.7 million to $63.9 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the after tax impact of $3.4 million in costs and $4.8 million in inventory purchase accounting associated with the Sargent acquisition, $0.7 million of costs associated with integration and restructuring, litigation reserve of $1.1 million and $0.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt offset $0.2 million of discrete tax benefit, net income would have been $73.8 million.\nGross Margin\n\nGross margin increased $48.7 million or 28.6% for fiscal 2016 compared to the same period last fiscal year. Excluding the unfavorable impact of $7.2 million of inventory purchase accounting associated with the Sargent acquisition, gross margin would have been $226.0 million. Organic gross margin as a percent of net sales was 38.9% compared to an adjusted 39.0% last fiscal year.\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSG&A decreased as a percentage of net sales to 16.5% in fiscal 2016 from 17.1% in fiscal 2015. SG&A expenses increased by $22.8 million to $98.7 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the Sargent acquisition of $17.7 million, the increase was primarily due to higher personnel expenses of $2.6 million, an increase in incentive stock compensation of $1.9 million, and increases in professional fees of $0.3 million and other miscellaneous expenses of $0.3 million.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nOther operating expenses for fiscal 2016 totaled $16.2 million compared to $5.8 million for fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2016 other operating expenses were comprised of $9.0 million in amortization of intangibles, $5.1 million of acquisition related costs, $1.7 million litigation reserve, $1.0 million in integration and restructuring costs offset by other income of $0.6 million. For fiscal 2015 other operating expense primarily consisted of $2.8 million related to the consolidation and restructuring of the U.K. facility, $1.8 million of amortization of intangibles and $1.5 million associated with acquisition activity offset by other income of $0.3 million.\nInterest Expense, Net\n\nInterest expense, net, generally consists of interest charged on our Wells Fargo Credit Agreement, mortgage, and other borrowings, offset by interest income (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity\u201d, below). Interest expense, net was $8.7 million for fiscal 2016 compared to $1.1 million for 2015.\n 24 \nOther Non-Operating Expense (Income)\n\nOther non-operating expense for fiscal 2015 totaled $2.8 million, consisting primarily of the negative impact of the removal of the foreign exchange cap of Swiss Francs 1.20 against the Euro.\nIncome Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense for fiscal 2016 was $30.9 million compared to $26.3 million for fiscal 2015. Our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.6% compared to 31.1% for fiscal 2015. In addition to discrete items, the effective income tax rates are different from the U.S. statutory rate due to a special manufacturing deduction in the U.S. and foreign income taxed at lower rates which decrease the rate, and state income taxes which increase the rate. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 of 32.6% includes discrete items of $0.2 million which are comprised substantially of unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing, the expiration of statutes of limitations and an item associated with federal legislation reinstating the U.S. research credit. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 without these discrete items would have been 32.8%. The effective income tax rate of 31.1% for fiscal 2015 includes discrete items in the amount of $5.5 million which are substantially comprised items associated with the consolidation and restructuring of the Company's U.K. manufacturing facility and unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 without these discrete items would have been 33.8%.\nSegment Information\nWe have four reportable product segments: Plain Bearings, Roller Bearings, Ball Bearings and Engineered Products. In fiscal 2016 we integrated the Sargent businesses into our Plain Bearings and Engineered Products segments (see Notes 3 and 18). We use net sales and gross margin as the primary measurement to assess the financial performance of each reportable segment. The presentation of segment net sales includes a reconciliation to adjust for the effects of any acquisitions made in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nPlain Bearing Segment:\n\n 25 \nNet sales increased $40.3 million, or 17.5%, for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the $42.3 million impact of acquisition volume from Sargent, net sales decreased $2.0 million, or 0.8%, compared to fiscal 2015. The net sales decrease of $2.0 million for this segment was mostly attributable to a net sales increase to the aerospace sector of $2.5 million offset by a net sales decrease of $2.6 million to the industrial sector, driven mainly by oil and gas, general industrial distribution and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.9 million.\nGross margin increased $17.4 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the $18.5 million impact from the Sargent acquisition, the segment achieved a gross margin of $85.0 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million, over fiscal 2015. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.6 million and product mix of $0.5 million.\nRoller Bearing Segment:\n\nNet sales decreased $16.7 million, or 12.9%, compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was attributable to net sales decreases to the industrial sector of $13.4 million mainly driven by oil and gas and general industrial markets and to the aerospace sector of $3.3 million mainly driven by defense.\nThe Roller Bearings segment achieved a gross margin of $47.5 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $50.0 million in fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the consolidation and restructuring of the U.K.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

Our precision solutions are integral to the manufacture and operation of most machines and mechanical systems, reduce wear to moving parts, facilitate proper power transmission and reduce damage and energy loss caused by friction. While we manufacture products in all major bearing categories, we focus primarily on the higher end of the bearing market where we believe our value added manufacturing and engineering capabilities enable us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and enhance profitability. We believe our unique expertise has enabled us to garner leading positions in many of the product markets in which we primarily compete. With 37 facilities, of which 33 are manufacturing facilities in five countries, we have been able to significantly broaden our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach. We have a fiscal year consisting of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. Based on this policy fiscal year 2016 had 53 weeks; fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 contained 52 weeks. We currently operate under four reportable business segments: Plain Bearings; Roller Bearings; Ball Bearings; and Engineered Products. The following further describes these reportable segments:\nPlain Bearings. Plain bearings are produced with either self-lubricating or metal-to-metal designs and consists of several sub-classes, including rod end bearings, spherical plain bearings and journal bearings. Unlike ball bearings, which are used in high-speed rotational applications, plain bearings are primarily used to rectify inevitable misalignments in various mechanical components.\nRoller Bearings. Roller bearings are anti-friction bearings that use rollers instead of balls. We manufacture four basic types of roller bearings: heavy duty needle roller bearings with inner rings, tapered roller bearings, track rollers and aircraft roller bearings.\nBall Bearings. We manufacture four basic types of ball bearings: high precision aerospace, airframe control, thin section and commercial ball bearings which are used in high-speed rotational applications.\nEngineered Products. Engineered Products consists of highly engineered hydraulics, fasteners, collets and precision components used in aerospace, marine and industrial applications\nPurchasers of bearings and engineered products include industrial equipment and machinery manufacturers, producers of commercial and military aerospace equipment such as missiles and radar systems, agricultural machinery manufacturers, construction, energy, mining and specialized equipment manufacturers, marine products, automotive and commercial truck manufacturers. The markets for our products are cyclical, and we have endeavored to mitigate this cyclicality by entering into sole-source relationships and long-term purchase agreements, through diversification across multiple market segments within the aerospace and industrial segments, by increasing sales to the aftermarket and by focusing on developing highly customized solutions.\nCurrently, our strategy is built around maintaining our role as a leading manufacturer of precision bearings and components through the following efforts:\n \u00b7 Developing innovative solutions. By leveraging our design and manufacturing expertise and our extensive customer relationships, we continue to develop new products for markets in which there are substantial growth opportunities. \n \u00b7 Expanding customer base and penetrating end markets. We continually seek opportunities to access new customers, geographic locations and bearing platforms with existing products or profitable new product opportunities. \n \u00b7 Increasing aftermarket sales. We believe that increasing our aftermarket sales of replacement parts will further enhance the continuity and predictability of our revenues and enhance our profitability. Such sales included sales to third party distributors, sales to OEMs for replacement products and aftermarket services. We will increase the percentage of our revenues derived from the replacement market by continuing to implement several initiatives. \n \u00b7 Pursuing selective acquisitions. The acquisition of businesses that complement or expand our operations has been and continues to be an important element of our business strategy. We believe that there will continue to be consolidation within the industry that may present us with acquisition opportunities. \nWe have demonstrated expertise in acquiring and integrating bearing and precision engineered component manufacturers that have complementary products or distribution channels and provide significant potential for margin enhancement. We have consistently increased the profitability of acquired businesses through a process of methods and systems improvement coupled with the introduction of complementary and proprietary new products. Since October 1992 we have completed 24 acquisitions, which have broadened our end markets, products, customer base and geographic reach.\n 21 \nThe following items highlight the most recent significant events:\n \u00b7 In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, subsequent to the close of the fiscal 2015 year, we acquired Sargent for $500.0 million financed through a combination of cash on hand and senior debt. Headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, Sargent is a leader in precision-engineered products, solutions and repairs for aircraft airframes and engines, rotorcraft, submarines and land vehicles. Sargent manufactures sells, and services hydraulic valves and actuators, specialty bearings, specialty fasteners, seal rings & alignment joints, and precision components under leading brands including Kahr Bearing, Airtomic, Sonic Industries, Sargent Controls and Sargent Aerospace & Defense. Annual sales are approximately $195.0 million and the company has over 750 employees in six facilities in three countries. \n \u00b7 In connection with the Sargent acquisition on April 24, 2015, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) and related Guarantee, Pledge Agreement and Security Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Swingline Lender and Letter of Credit Issuer and the other lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides RBCA, as Borrower, with (a) a $200.0 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (b) a $350.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and together with the Term Loan Facility, the Facilities\u201d). \n \u00b7 In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we reached a decision to consolidate the manufacturing capacity of the United Kingdom (U.K.) facility into our other manufacturing facilities. This decision was based on our intent to better align manufacturing abilities and product development. \n \u00b7 In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we acquired the net assets of TCI for approximately $3.9 million. Located in San Diego, California, TCI is an FAA certified aircraft gas turbine repair station and manufacturer of precision components for aerospace markets. \nOutlook\nWe ended fiscal 2016 with a backlog of $346.4 million compared to $209.6 million for the same period last fiscal year. Our net sales increased 34.2% year over year due to a 59.6% growth in the aerospace markets and 2.9% in the industrial markets. We expect to see growth in the industrial markets resulting from the overall economic improvement of the general industrial markets and continued growth in aerospace tied to the aircraft build rates and positive movement in defense spending. Our internal goal is to grow our industrial business at a pace of 2.0 to 2.5 times Gross Domestic Product ( GDP\u201d) on a compounded basis.\nManagement believes that operating cash flows and available credit under the credit facilities will provide adequate resources to fund internal and external growth initiatives for the foreseeable future. As of April 2, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $39.2 million of which approximately $29.3 million was cash held by our foreign operations. We expect that our undistributed foreign earnings will be re-invested indefinitely for working capital, internal growth and acquisitions for and by our foreign entities.\nSources of Revenue\nRevenue is generated primarily from sales of products to the industrial market and the aerospace markets. Sales are often made pursuant to sole-source relationships, long-term agreements and purchase orders with our customers. We recognize revenues principally from the sale of products at the point of passage of title, which is at the time of shipment, except for certain customers for which it occurs when the products reach their destination.\nWe also recognize revenue on a Ship-In-Place basis for two customers who have required that we hold the product after final production is complete. In this case, a written agreement has been executed (at the customer's request) whereby the customer accepts the risk of loss for product that is invoiced under the Ship-In-Place arrangement. For each transaction for which revenue is recognized under a Ship-In-Place arrangement, all final manufacturing inspections have been completed and customer acceptance has been obtained. In the twelve months ended April 2, 2016, 2.1% of our total net sales was recognized under Ship-In-Place transactions.\nSales to the industrial market accounted for 34% of our net sales for the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016. Sales to the aerospace and defense markets accounted for 66% of our net sales for the same period.\n 22 \nAftermarket sales of replacement parts for existing equipment platforms and aftermarket services represented approximately 46% of our net sales for fiscal 2016. We continue to develop our OEM relationships which have established us as a leading supplier on many important industrial, aerospace and defense platforms. Over the past several years, we have experienced increased demand from the replacement parts market, particularly within the diversified industrial sectors; one of our business strategies has been to increase the proportion of sales derived from this sector and from aerospace and defense. We believe these activities increase the stability of our revenue base, strengthen our brand identity and provide multiple paths for revenue growth.\nApproximately 13% of our net sales were generated by our international facilities for fiscal 2016, compared to 16% for fiscal 2015. We expect that this proportion will increase as we seek to increase our penetration of foreign markets. Our top ten customers generated 33% and 28% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. Out of the 33% of net sales generated by our top ten customers during the fiscal year ended April 2, 2016, 20% of net sales were generated by our top four customers compared to 15% for the comparable period last fiscal year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of sales includes employee compensation and benefits, raw materials, outside processing, depreciation of manufacturing machinery and equipment, supplies and manufacturing overhead.\nApproximately 12% to 25% of our costs, depending on product mix, are attributable to raw materials and purchased components, a majority of which are related to steel and related products. During fiscal 2016, steel prices remained flat with slight variances up and down throughout the fiscal year. When we do experience raw material inflation, we offset these cost increases by changing our buying patterns, expanding our vendor network and passing through price increases when possible. The overall impact on raw material costs for this fiscal year was not material as a percent change on a year over year basis.\nWe monitor gross margin performance through a process of monthly operation reviews with all our divisions. We develop new products to target certain markets allied to our strategies by first understanding volume levels and product pricing and then constructing manufacturing strategies to achieve defined margin objectives. We only pursue product lines where we believe that the developed manufacturing process will yield the targeted margins. Management monitors gross margins of all product lines on a monthly basis to determine which manufacturing processes or prices should be adjusted.\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nResults of Operations\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Organic net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>424.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(20.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.6 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales by recent acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>597.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income per common share: Diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Weighted average common shares: Diluted </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,508,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,385,061 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased $152.2 million or 34.2% for fiscal 2016 over fiscal 2015.

The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 of 32.6% includes discrete items of $0.2 million which are comprised substantially of unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing, the expiration of statutes of limitations and an item associated with federal legislation reinstating the U.S. research credit. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 without these discrete items would have been 32.8%. The effective income tax rate of 31.1% for fiscal 2015 includes discrete items in the amount of $5.5 million which are substantially comprised items associated with the consolidation and restructuring of the Company's U.K. manufacturing facility and unrecognized tax benefits associated with federal and state income tax audits closing and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015 without these discrete items would have been 33.8%.\nSegment Information\nWe have four reportable product segments: Plain Bearings, Roller Bearings, Ball Bearings and Engineered Products. In fiscal 2016 we integrated the Sargent businesses into our Plain Bearings and Engineered Products segments (see Notes 3 and 18). We use net sales and gross margin as the primary measurement to assess the financial performance of each reportable segment. The presentation of segment net sales includes a reconciliation to adjust for the effects of any acquisitions made in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015.\nPlain Bearing Segment:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Organic net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.8 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales by recent acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>270.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>% of segment net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 25 \nNet sales increased $40.3 million, or 17.5%, for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the $42.3 million impact of acquisition volume from Sargent, net sales decreased $2.0 million, or 0.8%, compared to fiscal 2015. The net sales decrease of $2.0 million for this segment was mostly attributable to a net sales increase to the aerospace sector of $2.5 million offset by a net sales decrease of $2.6 million to the industrial sector, driven mainly by oil and gas, general industrial distribution and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $1.9 million.\nGross margin increased $17.4 million for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. Excluding the $18.5 million impact from the Sargent acquisition, the segment achieved a gross margin of $85.0 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of $1.1 million, over fiscal 2015. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.6 million and product mix of $0.5 million.\nRoller Bearing Segment:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FY15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Organic net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales by recent acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total net sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>128.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.9 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross margin % </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>SG&A </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>% of segment net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales decreased $16.7 million, or 12.9%, compared to fiscal 2015.
