Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A, Risk factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a research stage biotechnology company committed to creating a new class of precision genetic medicines, based on our proprietary base editing technology, with a vision of providing life-long cures to patients suffering from serious diseases.\nOur proprietary base editing technology potentially enables an entirely new class of precision genetic medicines that targets a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. This approach uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at the targeted sequence, which we believe will dramatically increase the impact of gene editing for a broad range of therapeutic applications. We believe we will be able to rapidly advance our portfolio of novel base editing programs by building on the significant recent advances in the field of genetic medicines.\nOur novel base editors have two principal components that are fused together to form a single protein: (i) a CRISPR protein bound to a guide RNA, that leverages the established DNA-targeting ability of CRISPR, but modified to not cause a double-stranded break, and (ii) a base editing enzyme, such as a deaminase, which carries out the desired chemical modification of the target DNA base.\nWe have achieved proof-of-concept in vivo with long-term engraftment of ex vivo base edited human CD34 cells in mice for our Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, or HPFH, program, and we have demonstrated base editing of cells in vitro at therapeutically relevant levels for the majority of our remaining programs. We have also successfully demonstrated feasibility of base editing with each of our three delivery modalities in relevant cell types (electroporation and AAV) and in vivo in mice (LNP).\nWe expect to achieve additional preclinical proofs-of-concept in vivo for additional programs in 2020, which could include engraftment results for the Makassar precise correction sickle cell program, xenograft models for our CAR-T programs or in vivo based editing in our programs using LNP or AAV delivery. If successful, and provided the coronavirus disease of 2019, or COVID-19, does not cause our timelines to slip materially, this will allow us to initiate investigational new drug, or IND, enabling studies for multiple programs beginning in 2020. We expect to file an initial wave of IND filings beginning in 2021.\nFinancial operations overview\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated on January 25, 2017 and commenced operations shortly thereafter. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to building our base editing platform and advancing development of our portfolio of programs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property, conducting research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sales of our Series A-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock and, together with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock, and through proceeds from our February 2020 IPO. Through December 31, 2019, we have raised an aggregate of $223.6 million from the sale of our Preferred Stock.\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into a merger option agreement with Blink Therapeutics Inc., or Blink. In September 2018, we exercised our option to acquire Blink, or the Blink Merger, and Blink thereafter became our wholly owned subsidiary. Blink held rights to certain intellectual property related to RNA-based editing. Pursuant to the Blink Merger, we issued two shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock for each share of redeemable convertible series A preferred stock of Blink, and we issued 0.446 shares of our common stock for each share of Blink common stock. We began consolidating Blink on May 9, 2018.\nWe are a development stage company, and all of our programs are at a preclinical stage of development. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Since inception we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $78.3 million and $116.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.0 million.\nOur total operating expenses were $75.2 million and $45.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with ongoing development activities related to our portfolio of programs as we continue our preclinical development of product candidates; advance these product candidates toward clinical development; further develop our base editing platform; research activities as we seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; maintenance, expansion enforcement, defense, and protection of our intellectual property portfolio; and hiring research and development, clinical and commercial personnel. In addition, upon the closing of our IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We can give no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional funding will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, which include:\nTable 328: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost to obtain licenses to intellectual property, such as those with Harvard University, or Harvard, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, or Broad Institute, and Editas Medicine, Inc, or Editas, and related future payments should certain success, development and regulatory milestones be achieved;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 329: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 330: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 331: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 332: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> laboratory supplies and research materials; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 333: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other expenses which include direct and allocated expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are consumed.\nIn the early phases of development, our research and development costs are often devoted to product platform and proof-of-concept studies that are not necessarily allocable to a specific target, therefore, we have not yet begun tracking our expenses on a program-by-program basis.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and future clinical development activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, intellectual property, business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and direct and allocated facility related expenses and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support increased research and development activities. We also expect to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.\nOther income and expenses\nOther income and expenses consist of the following items:\nTable 334: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Change in fair value of derivative liabilities consists primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the anti-dilution issuance rights, finance milestone payment liabilities and success payment liabilities associated with our license agreement with Harvard, dated as of June 27, 2017, as amended, or the Harvard License Agreement, and the license agreement between Blink and Broad Institute, as amended, dated as of May 9, 2018, or the Broad License Agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnti-dilution issuance rights were issued to Harvard and Broad Institute allowing Harvard and Broad Institute to maintain a defined ownership percentage in us on a fully diluted basis upon subsequent equity financings until we achieved a defined aggregate level of preferred stock financing. At the inception of the agreements, the liability for the anti-dilution right was recorded at fair value with cost recorded as research and development expense and was remeasured at each reporting period and at the termination of the right with changes recorded in other income (expense).\nFinancing milestone payment liabilities are derived from future cash payments due to Harvard and Broad Institute upon the closing of additional rounds of Preferred Stock. At the inception of the agreements, the liabilities were recorded at fair value with cost recorded as research and development expense and were remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense).\nSuccess payment liabilities are derived from future increases in the per share fair market value of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock at specified future dates. At inception of the agreements, the success payment liabilities were recorded at fair market value with cost recorded as research and development expense and were remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense). Depending on our valuation, the success payment liabilities could fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAll anti-dilution issuance rights and finance milestone liabilities pursuant to our Harvard License Agreement and Broad License Agreement have been met as of December 31, 2018. Accordingly, we are no longer required to record liabilities for these rights.\nTable 335: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Loss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger represents the expense recognized upon the consummation of the Blink Merger.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, technology license expense was $13.3 million, which included: $5.3 million related to the Broad License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Broad Institute, $3.7 million related to the issuance of 3,055,555 shares of Preferred Stock under a license agreement with Editas, $2.2 million for additional shares of stock issued to Broad Institute upon the Blink merger, and other technology license expenses of $2.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue our current research programs, initiate new research programs, continue our preclinical development of product candidates and conduct future clinical trials for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.6 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $8.7 million was primarily a result of a $4.4 million increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in general and administrative employees from eight employees as of December 31, 2018 to 21 employees as of December 31, 2019, a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation due to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees as well as an increase in the value of our common stock, a $1.2 million increase in outsourced services including audit services as well as consulting services to supplement our internal capabilities, a $1.1 million increase in other administrative expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in expense allocated to general and administrative expense related to our leased facilities, including depreciation, to support the growing organization.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the anti-dilution rights related to the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad License Agreement terminated and we issued 765,549 shares of our common stock to Harvard and Blink issued 920,000 shares of its common stock (which was converted into 410,320 shares of our common stock in connection with the Blink Merger) to Broad Institute. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million change in fair value expense related to these anti-dilution issuance rights.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $9.7 million change in fair value expense related to financial milestone payments. All remaining financing milestone obligations were met in 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $5.4 million change in fair value expense related to the success payment liabilities as compared to a $0.7 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The success payment obligations are still outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and will continue to be revalued at each reporting period.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger of $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders at the time of the Blink Merger.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from issuance of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock at a fair value of the preferred stock in excess of the cash proceeds received.\nChange in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue and our investors' obligation to purchase additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each period while such instruments were outstanding. As a result of the changes in fair value, we recognized other expense of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the tranche rights had been exercised and the liabilities have been reclassified to preferred stock.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We began actively investing our funds in 2019.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to our equipment financing leases.

The increase of $9.8 million was primarily due to an increase in legal and patent costs of $4.3 million associated with establishing our patent portfolio, $1.7 million increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in general and administrative employees from one employee as of December 31, 2017 to eight employees as of December 31, 2018, $1.3 million increase in consulting services to supplement our internal capabilities, $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, and an increase in expense allocated to general and administrative expense related to our new leased facility, including depreciation of $0.7 million, to support the growing organization.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger consists of a $49.5 million charge for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Blink Merger. This charge represented the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders at the time of the Blink Merger.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors consisted of a $5.7 million discount for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted from issuance of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock due to the fair value of the preferred stock issued being in excess of the cash proceeds received.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the anti-dilution rights related to the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad License Agreement have terminated and, during the year ended December 31, 2018 we issued 765,549 shares of our common stock and Blink issued 920,000 shares of its common stock (which was converted into 410,320 shares of our common stock in connection with the Blink Merger) to Harvard and Broad Institute, respectively. In 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million change in fair value expense related to the anti-dilution issuance right as compared to no change in fair value expense in 2017.\nIn 2018, we recorded a $9.7 million change in fair value expense related to the financial milestone payment as compared to a $0.4 million expense in 2017. All remaining financing milestone obligations have been met in 2018, and we recorded a $13.8 million financing milestone liability for any unpaid balances on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we recorded a $0.7 million change in fair value expense related to the success payment liabilities as compared to a $0.1 million expense in 2017. The increase was a result of an increase in our valuation from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nChange in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue and our investors' obligation to purchase additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each period while such instruments were outstanding. As a result of the changes in fair value, we recognized other expense of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $0.4 million in other income for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the tranche rights have been exercised and the liabilities have been reclassified to preferred stock.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $0.3 million in 2018 due our investment in money market funds. There were no investments in 2017.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSince our inception in January 2017, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and, if successful, the clinical development of our programs. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of Preferred Stock. Through December 31, 2019, we raised an aggregate of $223.6 million in gross proceeds from sales of our Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had $91.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOn February 10, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 12,176,471 shares of our common stock, including 1,588,235 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds from our IPO of $188.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. We anticipate the need for additional capital in order to continue to fund our research and development, including our plans for clinical and preclinical trials and new product development, as well as to fund general operations. As and if necessary, we will seek to raise these additional funds through various potential sources, such as equity and debt financings or through corporate collaboration and license agreements. Especially in light of COVID-19, we can give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs For a more detailed discussion of risks related to our COVID-19, please see Item 1A., Risk factors-Risks related to our relationships with third parties, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCash flows\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 347: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (72,003\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (20,298\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66,659\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,424\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 179,727\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (decrease) increase in in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (97,383\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $72.0 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $78.3 million, a decrease in financing milestone liabilities of $13.8 million resulting from payment of these liabilities, a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $2.5 million, and an increase in prepaids and other assets of $1.9 million offset by cash provided by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.7 million, and noncash charges consisting primarily of stock based compensation expense of $7.0 million, change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $5.4 million, depreciation of $3.5 million, and non-cash lease expense of $1.9 million, offset by amortization of investment premiums of $0.9 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $20.3 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $116.7 million offset by the following noncash charges: loss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger of $49.5 million, change in fair value of derivatives consisting of anti-dilution rights, financial milestone payment liabilities and success payment liabilities of $11.7 million, non-cash research and development license expense of $7.4 million, loss on issuance of preferred stock to investors of $5.7 million, change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities of $4.3 million, and stock-based compensation of $7.0 million, as well as increases in deferred rent liability of $7.6 million due to the lease of a new facility in 2018 and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $4.0 million due to our growth.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017 was $2.7 million, consisting primarily of our net loss of $8.0 million partially offset by non-cash charges of $4.6 million primarily consisting of a non-cash research and development license expense of $4.3 million associated with our Harvard License Agreement; and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $0.9 million.\nInvesting activities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was primarily the net result of purchases of marketable securities partially offset by maturities of marketable securities of $53.7 million, in addition to purchases of property and equipment of $12.5 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018 and period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of $13.1 million and $0.3 million of purchases of property and equipment, respectively.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock of $37.9 million, and net proceeds of $5.7 million from equipment financing, offset by an increase in equity issuance costs of $2.5 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock of $19.8 million, Series A-2 Preferred Stock of $48.5 million, Blink Series A Preferred Stock of $14.9 million, and Series B Preferred Stock of $96.5 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017 was $5.0 million consisting of net proceeds from the first tranche of the issuance of Series A-1 Preferred Stock.\nFunding requirements\nOur operating expenses are expected to increase substantially as we continue to advance our portfolio of programs.\nSpecifically, our expenses will increase if and as we:\nTable 348: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> continue our current research programs and our preclinical development of product candidates from our current research programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 349: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 350: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 351: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> maintain, expand, enforce, defend, and protect our intellectual property portfolio and provide reimbursement of third-party expenses related to our patent portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 352: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 353: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> ultimately establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 354: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> further develop our base editing platform;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 355: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> hire additional personnel including research and development, clinical and commercial personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 356: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 357: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> acquire or in-license products, intellectual property, medicines and technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 358: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> should we decide to do so, build and maintain a commercial-scale current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, manufacturing facility;

We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be imprecise, and we may exhaust our available capital resources sooner that we currently expect.

We do not have any committed external source of funds. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends.\nIf we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates, or we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. We can give no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional funding will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nContractual obligations\nThe following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 371: <table> <tr> <td> Contractual obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n1 year and\nless than 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n3 years and\nless than 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 221,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,528\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 162,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,319\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,742\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,092\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 372: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents future minimum lease payments under our operating leases for office and lab space in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The incremental increase in total amount as a result of the amended lease is approximately $3.2 million, which does not include the additional lease payments of $1.6 million we would incur if we were to exercise our option to extend the lease for one year.\nThe table above also does not include potential milestone and success fees, sublicense fees, royalty fees, licensing maintenance fees, and reimbursement of patent maintenance costs that we may be required to pay under agreements we have entered into with certain institutions to license intellectual property. Our agreements to license intellectual property include potential milestone payments that are dependent upon the development of products using the intellectual property licensed under the agreements and contingent upon the achievement of development or regulatory approval milestones, as well as commercial and success payment milestones. We have not included such potential obligations in the table above because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty.\nAdditionally, we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with contract research organizations and other vendors to assist in the performance of our research and development activities and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice, and therefore are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under the applicable regulations of the SEC.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgements\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies, to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nStock-based compensation\nWe measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to our employees, directors, consultants or founders based upon their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nThe majority of our stock-based compensation awards are subject to either service- or performance-based vesting conditions. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with service-based vesting and recognize stock-based compensation for performance-based awards over the service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the of performance condition is probable.\nWe estimate the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which uses inputs such as the fair value of our common stock, assumptions we make for the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and our expected dividend yield. The fair value of our common stock is used to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards.\nDetermination of the fair value of our common stock issued prior to our IPO\nPrior to our IPO in February 2020, there was no public market for our common stock. As a result, prior to our IPO, the estimated fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors as of the date of each option grant, with input from management, considering our most recently available third-party valuations of common stock and our board of directors' assessment of additional objective and subjective factors that it believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the date of the grant. Third party valuations were performed in accordance with the framework of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Our common stock valuations were prepared using either an option pricing method, or OPM, or a hybrid method of the probability-weighted expected return method, or PWERM, both of which used market approaches to estimate our enterprise value. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on the total equity value of a company, with exercise prices based on the value thresholds at which the allocation among the various holders of a company's securities changes. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to stockholders exceeded the value of the preferred stock liquidation preferences at the time of the liquidity event, such as a strategic sale or a merger. The common stock is modeled as a call option on the underlying equity value at a predetermined exercise price. In the model, the exercise price is based on a comparison with the total equity value rather than, as in the case of a regular call option, a comparison with a per share stock price. Thus, common stock is considered to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred stock liquidation preference is paid. A discount for lack of marketability of the common stock is then applied to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. The hybrid method is a probability-weighted expected return method, where the equity value in one or more scenarios is calculated using an OPM. The PWERM is a scenario-based methodology that estimates the fair value of our common stock based upon an analysis of future values, assuming various outcomes. The common stock value is based on the probability-weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available as well as the rights of each class of stock. The future value of the common stock under each outcome is discounted back to the valuation date at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate and probability weighted to arrive at an indication of value for the common stock. These third-party valuations were performed at various dates, which resulted in valuations of our common stock of $0.49 per share as of June 30, 2017, $0.67 per share as of March 26, 2018, $1.03 per share as of June 11, 2018, $4.22 per share as of December 1, 2018, $7.22 per share as of April 30, 2019, $11.88 per share as of July 22, 2019, and $13.68 per share as of August 27, 2019. In addition to considering the results of these third-party valuations, our board of directors considered various objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of each grant date including:\nTable 373: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> prices at which we sold shares of Preferred Stock and the superior rights and preferences of the Preferred Stock relative to our common stock at the time of each grant;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 374: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the progress of our research and development programs, including the status and results of preclinical studies for our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our stage of development and our business strategy and the material risks related to our business and industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 376: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> external market conditions affecting the biopharmaceutical industry and the material risks related to our business and industry; and trends within the biopharmaceutical industry;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 377: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our financial position, including cash on hand, and our historical and forecasted performance and operating results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 378: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the lack of an active public market for our common stock and our Preferred Stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 379: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an IPO or sale of our company in light of prevailing market conditions; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 380: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the analysis of IPOs and the market performance of similar companies in the biopharmaceutical industry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe assumptions underlying these valuations represent management's best estimates, which involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgement. As a result, if factors or expected outcomes change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates, our stock-based compensation could be materially different.\nFollowing our IPO, the fair value of our common stock will be determined based on the quoted market price of our common stock.\nVariable interest entities\nWe review each legal entity formed by parties related to us to determine whether or not the entity is a variable interest entity, or VIE. If the entity is a VIE, we assess whether or not we are the primary beneficiary of that VIE based on a number of factors, including (i) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance, (ii) the parties' contractual rights and responsibilities pursuant to any contractual agreements and (iii) which party has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consolidate the financial statements of the VIE into our consolidated financial statements at the time that determination is made. On a quarterly basis we evaluate whether we continue to be the primary beneficiary of any consolidated VIEs. If we determine that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE, or no longer have a variable interest in the VIE, we deconsolidate the VIE in the period that the determination is made.\nOn March 22, 2018, certain of our investors, or the Primary Investors, formed Blink to hold certain intellectual property related to RNA base editing.\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into a merger option agreement, or the Option Agreement, with Blink. On the same date, Blink entered into the Broad License Agreement, issued 5,000,000 shares of Blink series A preferred stock to its investors at $1.00 per share, and issued restricted common stock to certain scientific founders. As of the date of the Option Agreement, Beam and Blink were both owned by members of the same group or Primary Investors, having over 75% ownership in each entity, which consisted primarily of our initial investors and scientific founders.\nUnder the Option Agreement, Blink granted us an option, exercisable on the date that Blink issued an aggregate of 10,000,000 additional shares of Blink series A preferred stock and ending on the second anniversary of such date, to consummate a merger with Blink in exchange for a $121,000 option premium. In connection with the Blink Merger, we issued two shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock for each share of Blink series A preferred stock and issued 0.446 shares of our common stock for each share of Blink common stock.\nAs of May 9, 2018, as a result of the design and purpose of Blink and the Option Agreement, we determined that Blink was a VIE and that we were the primary beneficiary, because we had both (1) the power to direct the activities of Blink that most significantly impacted Blink's economic performance and (2) the right to receive benefits from Blink that could be significant to Blink. As a result, we began consolidating Blink on May 9, 2018. The operating activity of Blink from its formation on March 22, 2018 to May 9, 2018 was immaterial. In August 2018, Blink issued 10,000,000 shares of Blink series A preferred stock at $1.00 per share to the Primary Investors and we paid the $121,000 option premium to exercise our option to merge with Blink. On September 25, 2018, or the Merger Date, the merger was consummated, and Blink became a wholly owned subsidiary of Beam. We recognized expense for the excess in value of the Beam Series A-2 Preferred Stock and common stock exchanged for the Blink series A preferred stock and common stock, because the excess value was only transferred to certain investors of Beam and there were no other rights or privileges identified that require separate accounting as an asset.\nFair value measurements\nPreferred stock tranche rights\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue, and our investors' obligation to purchase, additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock pursuant to the second closing and Series A-2 Preferred Stock pursuant to the third closing represented a freestanding instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. The preferred stock tranche liabilities were remeasured at each reporting period and upon the exercise or expiration of the obligation. The preferred stock tranche liabilities were valued using an option pricing model which utilized the fair value of the Preferred Stock, expected volatility, as well as the expected term. As of December 31, 2018, all redeemable convertible Series A-1 Preferred Stock and redeemable convertible Series A-2 Preferred Stock closings have occurred, and all tranche liabilities have been remeasured and reclassified to Preferred Stock.\nAnti-dilution issuance right\nAdditional shares of common stock were issued to Harvard and Broad Institute upon equity financings allowing Harvard and Broad Institute to maintain a defined ownership percentage in us on a fully diluted basis until we achieved a defined aggregate level of preferred stock financing. These anti-dilution issuance rights were accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and were initially recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to research and development expense. As such, we recorded this instrument as a liability at its fair value with a corresponding amount recorded as research and development expense and marked it to market at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations at each period-end while this instrument was outstanding. The liability was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on the change of several key variables, including the time to the capital raise, the probability of the capital raise, as well as the fair value of our common stock. During 2018, the anti-dilution rights were satisfied and there is no additional derivative liability accounting.\nFinancing milestone payments\nWe were required to make cash payments to Harvard and Broad Institute upon the achievement of future financing milestones tied to the closing of additional rounds of Preferred Stock. The financing milestone payments were accounted for under ASC 815, and were initially recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to research and development expense. The liabilities were marked to market at each balance sheet date with all changes in value recognized in other income or expense in the consolidated statement of operations. We adjusted the liability for changes in fair value until the achievement of the financing milestones. To determine the estimated fair value of the financial milestone payments, we used a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on the change of several key variables, including time to capital raise, probabilities to capital raise, cost of debt, as well as the projected price per share upon issuance. As of December 31, 2018, all financing milestone payments have been achieved and were either paid in cash or are recorded in accrued expenses for actual amounts due.\nSuccess payments\nWe are required to make success payments to Harvard and Broad Institute based on increases in the per share fair market value of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock, payable in cash. Subsequent to the February 2020 IPO, the amount of success payments will be based on the market value of our common stock. The success payments are accounted for under ASC 815 and are initially recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to research and development expense. The liabilities are marked to market at each balance sheet date with all changes in value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the achievement or expiration of the success payment obligation. To determine the estimated fair value of the success payments, we used a Monte Carlo simulation model, which models the value of the liability based on several key variables, including probability of event occurrence, timing of event occurrence, as well as the price per share at the time of success payment.\nLeases\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), or ASC 842, which requires the recognition of the right-of-use assets and related operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at January 1, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 had a substantial impact on our consolidated balance sheet but did not have a material effect on the company's consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders' deficit. Upon adoption of ASC 842, we recorded $14.2 million and $21.7 million to operating lease right-of-use assets and the related lease liabilities, respectively. The operating lease liabilities are based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments discounted using our secured incremental borrowing rate at the effective date of January 1, 2019.\nFor contracts entered into on or after the effective date, at the inception of a contract, we assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether we have the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments.\nLeases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any of these criteria.\nFor all leases at the lease commencement date, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred if any, less any lease incentives received. All right-of-use assets are reviewed for impairment. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, our secured incremental borrowing rate for the same term as the underlying lease. For real estate leases and other operating leases, we use its secured incremental borrowing rate. For finance leases, we use the rate implicit in the lease or its secured incremental borrowing rate if the implicit lease rate cannot be determined.\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following: the fixed noncancelable lease payments, payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early.\nLease cost for operating leases consists of the lease payments plus any initial direct costs, primarily brokerage commissions, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease cost are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that are not included in the initial lease liability and lease payments incurred in the period for any leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. Lease cost for finance leases consists of the amortization of the right-of-use asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense determined on an amortized cost basis. The lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense.\nWe made an accounting policy election to not recognize leases with an initial term of 12 months or less within our consolidated balance sheets and to recognize those lease payments on a straight-line basis in our consolidated statements of income over the lease term.\nJOBS Act\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe may take advantage of these exemptions until December 31, 2025 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company earlier if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, we have more than $700.0 million in market value of our stock held by non-affiliates (and we have been a public company for at least 12 months and have filed one annual report on Form 10-K) or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted, and intend, to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably elect to opt out\u201d of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. Therefore, the reported results of operations contained in our consolidated financial statements may not be directly comparable to those of other public companies.", "summary": "The report provides an overview of a research stage biotechnology company that is focused on creating precision genetic medicines using base editing technology.

"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A, Risk factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a research stage biotechnology company committed to creating a new class of precision genetic medicines, based on our proprietary base editing technology, with a vision of providing life-long cures to patients suffering from serious diseases.\nOur proprietary base editing technology potentially enables an entirely new class of precision genetic medicines that targets a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. This approach uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at the targeted sequence, which we believe will dramatically increase the impact of gene editing for a broad range of therapeutic applications. We believe we will be able to rapidly advance our portfolio of novel base editing programs by building on the significant recent advances in the field of genetic medicines.\nOur novel base editors have two principal components that are fused together to form a single protein: (i) a CRISPR protein bound to a guide RNA, that leverages the established DNA-targeting ability of CRISPR, but modified to not cause a double-stranded break, and (ii) a base editing enzyme, such as a deaminase, which carries out the desired chemical modification of the target DNA base.\nWe have achieved proof-of-concept in vivo with long-term engraftment of ex vivo base edited human CD34 cells in mice for our Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, or HPFH, program, and we have demonstrated base editing of cells in vitro at therapeutically relevant levels for the majority of our remaining programs. We have also successfully demonstrated feasibility of base editing with each of our three delivery modalities in relevant cell types (electroporation and AAV) and in vivo in mice (LNP).\nWe expect to achieve additional preclinical proofs-of-concept in vivo for additional programs in 2020, which could include engraftment results for the Makassar precise correction sickle cell program, xenograft models for our CAR-T programs or in vivo based editing in our programs using LNP or AAV delivery. If successful, and provided the coronavirus disease of 2019, or COVID-19, does not cause our timelines to slip materially, this will allow us to initiate investigational new drug, or IND, enabling studies for multiple programs beginning in 2020. We expect to file an initial wave of IND filings beginning in 2021.\nFinancial operations overview\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated on January 25, 2017 and commenced operations shortly thereafter. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to building our base editing platform and advancing development of our portfolio of programs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property, conducting research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sales of our Series A-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock and, together with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock, and through proceeds from our February 2020 IPO. Through December 31, 2019, we have raised an aggregate of $223.6 million from the sale of our Preferred Stock.\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into a merger option agreement with Blink Therapeutics Inc., or Blink. In September 2018, we exercised our option to acquire Blink, or the Blink Merger, and Blink thereafter became our wholly owned subsidiary. Blink held rights to certain intellectual property related to RNA-based editing. Pursuant to the Blink Merger, we issued two shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock for each share of redeemable convertible series A preferred stock of Blink, and we issued 0.446 shares of our common stock for each share of Blink common stock. We began consolidating Blink on May 9, 2018.\nWe are a development stage company, and all of our programs are at a preclinical stage of development. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Since inception we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $78.3 million and $116.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.0 million.\nOur total operating expenses were $75.2 million and $45.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with ongoing development activities related to our portfolio of programs as we continue our preclinical development of product candidates; advance these product candidates toward clinical development; further develop our base editing platform; research activities as we seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; maintenance, expansion enforcement, defense, and protection of our intellectual property portfolio; and hiring research and development, clinical and commercial personnel. In addition, upon the closing of our IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We can give no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional funding will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, which include:\n \u2022 the cost to obtain licenses to intellectual property, such as those with Harvard University, or Harvard, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, or Broad Institute, and Editas Medicine, Inc, or Editas, and related future payments should certain success, development and regulatory milestones be achieved; \n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations; \n \u2022 the cost of developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials; \n \u2022 laboratory supplies and research materials; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses which include direct and allocated expenses. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are consumed.\nIn the early phases of development, our research and development costs are often devoted to product platform and proof-of-concept studies that are not necessarily allocable to a specific target, therefore, we have not yet begun tracking our expenses on a program-by-program basis.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and future clinical development activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, intellectual property, business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and direct and allocated facility related expenses and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support increased research and development activities. We also expect to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.\nOther income and expenses\nOther income and expenses consist of the following items:\n \u2022 Change in fair value of derivative liabilities consists primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the anti-dilution issuance rights, finance milestone payment liabilities and success payment liabilities associated with our license agreement with Harvard, dated as of June 27, 2017, as amended, or the Harvard License Agreement, and the license agreement between Blink and Broad Institute, as amended, dated as of May 9, 2018, or the Broad License Agreement. \nAnti-dilution issuance rights were issued to Harvard and Broad Institute allowing Harvard and Broad Institute to maintain a defined ownership percentage in us on a fully diluted basis upon subsequent equity financings until we achieved a defined aggregate level of preferred stock financing. At the inception of the agreements, the liability for the anti-dilution right was recorded at fair value with cost recorded as research and development expense and was remeasured at each reporting period and at the termination of the right with changes recorded in other income (expense).\nFinancing milestone payment liabilities are derived from future cash payments due to Harvard and Broad Institute upon the closing of additional rounds of Preferred Stock. At the inception of the agreements, the liabilities were recorded at fair value with cost recorded as research and development expense and were remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense).\nSuccess payment liabilities are derived from future increases in the per share fair market value of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock at specified future dates. At inception of the agreements, the success payment liabilities were recorded at fair market value with cost recorded as research and development expense and were remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense). Depending on our valuation, the success payment liabilities could fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAll anti-dilution issuance rights and finance milestone liabilities pursuant to our Harvard License Agreement and Broad License Agreement have been met as of December 31, 2018. Accordingly, we are no longer required to record liabilities for these rights.\n \u2022 Loss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger represents the expense recognized upon the consummation of the Blink Merger. Pursuant to the Blink Merger, we issued two shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock for each share of Blink and took a charge representing the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders. \n \u2022 Loss on issuance of preferred stock to investors consists of a charge taken upon issuance of our Preferred Stock at a discount due to an increase in value above the sale price. \n \u2022 Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the tranche rights associated with our Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock. All obligations have been met at December 31, 2018 and therefore there will be no further remeasurement. \nResults of operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the change in dollars (in thousands):\n\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing Verve license revenue recorded under the Collaboration and License Agreement executed in April 2019. There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $54.6 million and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $20.7 million was primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 Increases of $16.4 million in lab supplies and outsourced services, $10.7 million in personnel-related costs, and $4.6 million in facility-related costs, including depreciation. These increases were due to the growth in the number of research and development employees from 40 at December 31, 2018 to 97 at December 31, 2019, and their related activities, as well as the expense allocated to research and development related to our leased facilities. \n \u2022 A decrease of $1.7 million in stock compensation due to a one-time charge of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Blink merger offset by an increase in stock compensation expense for additional stock option awards due to the increase in the number of research and development employees in 2019. \n \u2022 A decrease of $10.0 million in expenses related to technology licenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, technology license expense was $3.4 million, which consisted primarily of option fees of $2.4 million related to a technology license agreement and $0.8 million, which consisted primarily of the license fee and fair value of Beam common stock provided to Bio Palette in conjunction with a license agreement executed in March 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, technology license expense was $13.3 million, which included: $5.3 million related to the Broad License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Broad Institute, $3.7 million related to the issuance of 3,055,555 shares of Preferred Stock under a license agreement with Editas, $2.2 million for additional shares of stock issued to Broad Institute upon the Blink merger, and other technology license expenses of $2.0 million. \nResearch and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue our current research programs, initiate new research programs, continue our preclinical development of product candidates and conduct future clinical trials for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.6 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $8.7 million was primarily a result of a $4.4 million increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in general and administrative employees from eight employees as of December 31, 2018 to 21 employees as of December 31, 2019, a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation due to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees as well as an increase in the value of our common stock, a $1.2 million increase in outsourced services including audit services as well as consulting services to supplement our internal capabilities, a $1.1 million increase in other administrative expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in expense allocated to general and administrative expense related to our leased facilities, including depreciation, to support the growing organization.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the anti-dilution rights related to the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad License Agreement terminated and we issued 765,549 shares of our common stock to Harvard and Blink issued 920,000 shares of its common stock (which was converted into 410,320 shares of our common stock in connection with the Blink Merger) to Broad Institute. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million change in fair value expense related to these anti-dilution issuance rights.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $9.7 million change in fair value expense related to financial milestone payments. All remaining financing milestone obligations were met in 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $5.4 million change in fair value expense related to the success payment liabilities as compared to a $0.7 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The success payment obligations are still outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and will continue to be revalued at each reporting period.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger of $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders at the time of the Blink Merger.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from issuance of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock at a fair value of the preferred stock in excess of the cash proceeds received.\nChange in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue and our investors' obligation to purchase additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each period while such instruments were outstanding. As a result of the changes in fair value, we recognized other expense of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the tranche rights had been exercised and the liabilities have been reclassified to preferred stock.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We began actively investing our funds in 2019.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to our equipment financing leases. There was no corresponding interest expense in 2018.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2018 and period ended December 31, 2017\n\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017. The increase of $28.0 million was primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 An $8.5 million increase in expenses related to technology licenses. In 2018, technology license expense included: $5.3 million related to the Broad License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Broad Institute, $2.2 million related to the issuance of 410,320 additional shares of Beam common stock to Broad Institute in connection with the Blink Merger, $3.7 million related to the issuance of 3,055,555 shares of Preferred Stock under a license agreement with Editas; and other technology license expenses of $2.0 million. In 2017, technology license expenses included $4.8 million related to the Harvard License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Harvard. These amounts were recorded as research and development expenses as they are considered compensation for the respective license agreements. \n \u2022 Increases of $5.9 million in lab supplies and outsourced services, $4.4 million in personnel-related costs, and $3.2 million in facility-related costs, including depreciation. These increases were due to the growth in the number of research and development employees from four at December 31, 2017 to 40 at December 31, 2018, and their related activities, as well as the expense allocated to research and development related to our new leased facility. \n \u2022 An increase of $5.7 million in stock compensation, including $3.6 million of expense representing the difference in value of the fully vested shares issued to the scientific founders of Blink and the value exchanged by the Blink shareholders at the \n time of the Blink Merger. The remainder of the increase was due to the increase in the number of research and development employees from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. \nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 million for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $9.8 million was primarily due to an increase in legal and patent costs of $4.3 million associated with establishing our patent portfolio, $1.7 million increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in general and administrative employees from one employee as of December 31, 2017 to eight employees as of December 31, 2018, $1.3 million increase in consulting services to supplement our internal capabilities, $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, and an increase in expense allocated to general and administrative expense related to our new leased facility, including depreciation of $0.7 million, to support the growing organization.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger consists of a $49.5 million charge for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Blink Merger. This charge represented the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders at the time of the Blink Merger.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors consisted of a $5.7 million discount for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted from issuance of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock due to the fair value of the preferred stock issued being in excess of the cash proceeds received.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the anti-dilution rights related to the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad License Agreement have terminated and, during the year ended December 31, 2018 we issued 765,549 shares of our common stock and Blink issued 920,000 shares of its common stock (which was converted into 410,320 shares of our common stock in connection with the Blink Merger) to Harvard and Broad Institute, respectively. In 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million change in fair value expense related to the anti-dilution issuance right as compared to no change in fair value expense in 2017.\nIn 2018, we recorded a $9.7 million change in fair value expense related to the financial milestone payment as compared to a $0.4 million expense in 2017. All remaining financing milestone obligations have been met in 2018, and we recorded a $13.8 million financing milestone liability for any unpaid balances on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we recorded a $0.7 million change in fair value expense related to the success payment liabilities as compared to a $0.1 million expense in 2017. The increase was a result of an increase in our valuation from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nChange in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue and our investors' obligation to purchase additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each period while such instruments were outstanding. As a result of the changes in fair value, we recognized other expense of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $0.4 million in other income for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the tranche rights have been exercised and the liabilities have been reclassified to preferred stock.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $0.3 million in 2018 due our investment in money market funds. There were no investments in 2017.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSince our inception in January 2017, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and, if successful, the clinical development of our programs. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of Preferred Stock. Through December 31, 2019, we raised an aggregate of $223.6 million in gross proceeds from sales of our Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had $91.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOn February 10, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 12,176,471 shares of our common stock, including 1,588,235 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds from our IPO of $188.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nTo date,", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Some of the numbers included herein have been rounded for the convenience of presentation. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those discussed under Item 1A, Risk factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are a research stage biotechnology company committed to creating a new class of precision genetic medicines, based on our proprietary base editing technology, with a vision of providing life-long cures to patients suffering from serious diseases.\nOur proprietary base editing technology potentially enables an entirely new class of precision genetic medicines that targets a single base in the genome without making a double-stranded break in the DNA. This approach uses a chemical reaction designed to create precise, predictable and efficient genetic outcomes at the targeted sequence, which we believe will dramatically increase the impact of gene editing for a broad range of therapeutic applications. We believe we will be able to rapidly advance our portfolio of novel base editing programs by building on the significant recent advances in the field of genetic medicines.\nOur novel base editors have two principal components that are fused together to form a single protein: (i) a CRISPR protein bound to a guide RNA, that leverages the established DNA-targeting ability of CRISPR, but modified to not cause a double-stranded break, and (ii) a base editing enzyme, such as a deaminase, which carries out the desired chemical modification of the target DNA base.\nWe have achieved proof-of-concept in vivo with long-term engraftment of ex vivo base edited human CD34 cells in mice for our Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin, or HPFH, program, and we have demonstrated base editing of cells in vitro at therapeutically relevant levels for the majority of our remaining programs. We have also successfully demonstrated feasibility of base editing with each of our three delivery modalities in relevant cell types (electroporation and AAV) and in vivo in mice (LNP).\nWe expect to achieve additional preclinical proofs-of-concept in vivo for additional programs in 2020, which could include engraftment results for the Makassar precise correction sickle cell program, xenograft models for our CAR-T programs or in vivo based editing in our programs using LNP or AAV delivery. If successful, and provided the coronavirus disease of 2019, or COVID-19, does not cause our timelines to slip materially, this will allow us to initiate investigational new drug, or IND, enabling studies for multiple programs beginning in 2020. We expect to file an initial wave of IND filings beginning in 2021.\nFinancial operations overview\nGeneral\nWe were incorporated on January 25, 2017 and commenced operations shortly thereafter. Since our inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to building our base editing platform and advancing development of our portfolio of programs, establishing and protecting our intellectual property, conducting research and development activities, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sales of our Series A-1 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series A-2 redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, and Series B redeemable convertible preferred stock, or the Series B Preferred Stock and, together with the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock, and through proceeds from our February 2020 IPO. Through December 31, 2019, we have raised an aggregate of $223.6 million from the sale of our Preferred Stock.\nOn May 9, 2018, we entered into a merger option agreement with Blink Therapeutics Inc., or Blink. In September 2018, we exercised our option to acquire Blink, or the Blink Merger, and Blink thereafter became our wholly owned subsidiary. Blink held rights to certain intellectual property related to RNA-based editing. Pursuant to the Blink Merger, we issued two shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock for each share of redeemable convertible series A preferred stock of Blink, and we issued 0.446 shares of our common stock for each share of Blink common stock. We began consolidating Blink on May 9, 2018.\nWe are a development stage company, and all of our programs are at a preclinical stage of development. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Since inception we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $78.3 million and $116.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $203.0 million.\nOur total operating expenses were $75.2 million and $45.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses in connection with ongoing development activities related to our portfolio of programs as we continue our preclinical development of product candidates; advance these product candidates toward clinical development; further develop our base editing platform; research activities as we seek to discover and develop additional product candidates; maintenance, expansion enforcement, defense, and protection of our intellectual property portfolio; and hiring research and development, clinical and commercial personnel. In addition, upon the closing of our IPO, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.\nAs a result of these anticipated expenditures, we will need additional financing to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy. We can give no assurance that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or, if such funds are available to us, that such additional funding will be sufficient to meet our needs.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, which include:\n \u2022 the cost to obtain licenses to intellectual property, such as those with Harvard University, or Harvard, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, or Broad Institute, and Editas Medicine, Inc, or Editas, and related future payments should certain success, development and regulatory milestones be achieved; \n \u2022 personnel-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees engaged in research and development functions; \n \u2022 expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and preclinical development of our research programs, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations; \n \u2022 the cost of developing and validating our manufacturing process for use in our preclinical studies and future clinical trials; \n \u2022 laboratory supplies and research materials; and \n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses which include direct and allocated expenses. \nWe expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the benefits are consumed.\nIn the early phases of development, our research and development costs are often devoted to product platform and proof-of-concept studies that are not necessarily allocable to a specific target, therefore, we have not yet begun tracking our expenses on a program-by-program basis.\nWe expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned preclinical and future clinical development activities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, intellectual property, business development, and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters, professional fees for accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services, insurance costs, travel, and direct and allocated facility related expenses and other operating costs.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support increased research and development activities. We also expect to incur increased costs associated with being a public company, including costs of accounting, audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs, and investor and public relations costs.\nOther income and expenses\nOther income and expenses consist of the following items:\n \u2022 Change in fair value of derivative liabilities consists primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the anti-dilution issuance rights, finance milestone payment liabilities and success payment liabilities associated with our license agreement with Harvard, dated as of June 27, 2017, as amended, or the Harvard License Agreement, and the license agreement between Blink and Broad Institute, as amended, dated as of May 9, 2018, or the Broad License Agreement. \nAnti-dilution issuance rights were issued to Harvard and Broad Institute allowing Harvard and Broad Institute to maintain a defined ownership percentage in us on a fully diluted basis upon subsequent equity financings until we achieved a defined aggregate level of preferred stock financing. At the inception of the agreements, the liability for the anti-dilution right was recorded at fair value with cost recorded as research and development expense and was remeasured at each reporting period and at the termination of the right with changes recorded in other income (expense).\nFinancing milestone payment liabilities are derived from future cash payments due to Harvard and Broad Institute upon the closing of additional rounds of Preferred Stock. At the inception of the agreements, the liabilities were recorded at fair value with cost recorded as research and development expense and were remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense).\nSuccess payment liabilities are derived from future increases in the per share fair market value of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock at specified future dates. At inception of the agreements, the success payment liabilities were recorded at fair market value with cost recorded as research and development expense and were remeasured at each reporting period with changes recorded in other income (expense). Depending on our valuation, the success payment liabilities could fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nAll anti-dilution issuance rights and finance milestone liabilities pursuant to our Harvard License Agreement and Broad License Agreement have been met as of December 31, 2018. Accordingly, we are no longer required to record liabilities for these rights.\n \u2022 Loss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger represents the expense recognized upon the consummation of the Blink Merger. Pursuant to the Blink Merger, we issued two shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock for each share of Blink and took a charge representing the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders. \n \u2022 Loss on issuance of preferred stock to investors consists of a charge taken upon issuance of our Preferred Stock at a discount due to an increase in value above the sale price. \n \u2022 Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses associated with changes in the fair value of the tranche rights associated with our Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock. All obligations have been met at December 31, 2018 and therefore there will be no further remeasurement. \nResults of operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, together with the change in dollars (in thousands):\nTable 338: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> License revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,741\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29,413\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of derivative liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,400\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,715\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,325\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,486\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (71\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,172\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,997\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,825\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (78,326\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (116,738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,412\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLicense revenue\nLicense revenue was $18,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing Verve license revenue recorded under the Collaboration and License Agreement executed in April 2019. There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $54.6 million and $33.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $20.7 million was primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 Increases of $16.4 million in lab supplies and outsourced services, $10.7 million in personnel-related costs, and $4.6 million in facility-related costs, including depreciation. These increases were due to the growth in the number of research and development employees from 40 at December 31, 2018 to 97 at December 31, 2019, and their related activities, as well as the expense allocated to research and development related to our leased facilities. \n \u2022 A decrease of $1.7 million in stock compensation due to a one-time charge of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Blink merger offset by an increase in stock compensation expense for additional stock option awards due to the increase in the number of research and development employees in 2019. \n \u2022 A decrease of $10.0 million in expenses related to technology licenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, technology license expense was $3.4 million, which consisted primarily of option fees of $2.4 million related to a technology license agreement and $0.8 million, which consisted primarily of the license fee and fair value of Beam common stock provided to Bio Palette in conjunction with a license agreement executed in March 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, technology license expense was $13.3 million, which included: $5.3 million related to the Broad License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Broad Institute, $3.7 million related to the issuance of 3,055,555 shares of Preferred Stock under a license agreement with Editas, $2.2 million for additional shares of stock issued to Broad Institute upon the Blink merger, and other technology license expenses of $2.0 million. \nResearch and development expenses will continue to increase as we continue our current research programs, initiate new research programs, continue our preclinical development of product candidates and conduct future clinical trials for any of our product candidates.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $20.6 million and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase of $8.7 million was primarily a result of a $4.4 million increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in general and administrative employees from eight employees as of December 31, 2018 to 21 employees as of December 31, 2019, a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation due to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees as well as an increase in the value of our common stock, a $1.2 million increase in outsourced services including audit services as well as consulting services to supplement our internal capabilities, a $1.1 million increase in other administrative expenses, and a $0.3 million increase in expense allocated to general and administrative expense related to our leased facilities, including depreciation, to support the growing organization.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the anti-dilution rights related to the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad License Agreement terminated and we issued 765,549 shares of our common stock to Harvard and Blink issued 920,000 shares of its common stock (which was converted into 410,320 shares of our common stock in connection with the Blink Merger) to Broad Institute. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million change in fair value expense related to these anti-dilution issuance rights.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a $9.7 million change in fair value expense related to financial milestone payments. All remaining financing milestone obligations were met in 2018.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $5.4 million change in fair value expense related to the success payment liabilities as compared to a $0.7 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2018. The success payment obligations are still outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and will continue to be revalued at each reporting period.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger of $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 represented the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders at the time of the Blink Merger.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors of $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 resulted from issuance of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock at a fair value of the preferred stock in excess of the cash proceeds received.\nChange in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue and our investors' obligation to purchase additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each period while such instruments were outstanding. As a result of the changes in fair value, we recognized other expense of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the tranche rights had been exercised and the liabilities have been reclassified to preferred stock.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We began actively investing our funds in 2019.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to our equipment financing leases. There was no corresponding interest expense in 2018.\nComparison of year ended December 31, 2018 and period ended December 31, 2017\nTable 342: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Period from\nJanuary 25,\n2017 (Inception)\nto December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 28,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,861\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49,500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,715\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,715\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of derivative liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (500\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,249\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,325\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,729\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (26\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,997\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (122\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (70,875\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (116,738\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (108,736\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses were $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $5.9 million for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017. The increase of $28.0 million was primarily due to the following:\n \u2022 An $8.5 million increase in expenses related to technology licenses. In 2018, technology license expense included: $5.3 million related to the Broad License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Broad Institute, $2.2 million related to the issuance of 410,320 additional shares of Beam common stock to Broad Institute in connection with the Blink Merger, $3.7 million related to the issuance of 3,055,555 shares of Preferred Stock under a license agreement with Editas; and other technology license expenses of $2.0 million. In 2017, technology license expenses included $4.8 million related to the Harvard License Agreement for the initial value of anti-dilution rights, financing milestone payment liabilities, success payment liabilities, and the initial shares of common stock issued to Harvard. These amounts were recorded as research and development expenses as they are considered compensation for the respective license agreements. \n \u2022 Increases of $5.9 million in lab supplies and outsourced services, $4.4 million in personnel-related costs, and $3.2 million in facility-related costs, including depreciation. These increases were due to the growth in the number of research and development employees from four at December 31, 2017 to 40 at December 31, 2018, and their related activities, as well as the expense allocated to research and development related to our new leased facility. \n \u2022 An increase of $5.7 million in stock compensation, including $3.6 million of expense representing the difference in value of the fully vested shares issued to the scientific founders of Blink and the value exchanged by the Blink shareholders at the \n time of the Blink Merger. The remainder of the increase was due to the increase in the number of research and development employees from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. \nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 million for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) ended December 31, 2017. The increase of $9.8 million was primarily due to an increase in legal and patent costs of $4.3 million associated with establishing our patent portfolio, $1.7 million increase in personnel related costs due to an increase in general and administrative employees from one employee as of December 31, 2017 to eight employees as of December 31, 2018, $1.3 million increase in consulting services to supplement our internal capabilities, $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, and an increase in expense allocated to general and administrative expense related to our new leased facility, including depreciation of $0.7 million, to support the growing organization.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with Blink Merger\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock in connection with the Blink Merger consists of a $49.5 million charge for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to the Blink Merger. This charge represented the excess of the fair value of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock issued to Blink shareholders over the value of the Blink preferred stock exchanged by Blink shareholders at the time of the Blink Merger.\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors\nLoss on issuance of preferred stock to investors consisted of a $5.7 million discount for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulted from issuance of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock due to the fair value of the preferred stock issued being in excess of the cash proceeds received.\nChange in fair value of derivative liabilities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the anti-dilution rights related to the Harvard License Agreement and the Broad License Agreement have terminated and, during the year ended December 31, 2018 we issued 765,549 shares of our common stock and Blink issued 920,000 shares of its common stock (which was converted into 410,320 shares of our common stock in connection with the Blink Merger) to Harvard and Broad Institute, respectively. In 2018, we recorded a $1.3 million change in fair value expense related to the anti-dilution issuance right as compared to no change in fair value expense in 2017.\nIn 2018, we recorded a $9.7 million change in fair value expense related to the financial milestone payment as compared to a $0.4 million expense in 2017. All remaining financing milestone obligations have been met in 2018, and we recorded a $13.8 million financing milestone liability for any unpaid balances on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018.\nIn 2018, we recorded a $0.7 million change in fair value expense related to the success payment liabilities as compared to a $0.1 million expense in 2017. The increase was a result of an increase in our valuation from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nChange in fair value of preferred stock tranche liabilities\nWe have determined that our obligation to issue and our investors' obligation to purchase additional shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock and Series A-2 Preferred Stock represented a freestanding financial instrument. The resulting preferred stock tranche liability was initially recorded at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at each period while such instruments were outstanding. As a result of the changes in fair value, we recognized other expense of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $0.4 million in other income for the period from January 25, 2017 (Inception) to December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, the tranche rights have been exercised and the liabilities have been reclassified to preferred stock.\nInterest income\nInterest income was $0.3 million in 2018 due our investment in money market funds. There were no investments in 2017.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nSince our inception in January 2017, we have incurred significant operating losses. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the preclinical and, if successful, the clinical development of our programs. To date, we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from the sales of Preferred Stock. Through December 31, 2019, we raised an aggregate of $223.6 million in gross proceeds from sales of our Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had $91.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOn February 10, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 12,176,471 shares of our common stock, including 1,588,235 shares of common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters' full exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, at a public offering price of $17.00 per share. We received net proceeds from our IPO of $188.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us.\nTo date,"}
