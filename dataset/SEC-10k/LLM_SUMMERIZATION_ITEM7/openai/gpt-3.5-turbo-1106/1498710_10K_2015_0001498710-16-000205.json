MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.\n2015 Year in Review\nThe year 2015 marks our ninth consecutive year of profitability. In 2015, we increased our capacity by 30.0%, as we grew our fleet of Airbus single-aisle aircraft from 65 to 79 aircraft, launched service to 40 new markets and added 1 new destination: Cleveland, Ohio.\nDuring 2015, we earned net income of $317.2 million ($4.38 per share, diluted), compared to net income of $225.5 million ($3.08 per share, diluted) in 2014. The increase in earnings was a result of our increased capacity as well as lower fuel and non-fuel unit costs, which allowed us to continue generating high profit margins.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we achieved an operating profit margin of 23.8%, the highest in our history, on $2,141.5 million in operating revenues. Our traffic grew by 27.1% as we continued to address an underserved market with ultra-low fares. Increased competitive pressures from major domestic network carriers aggressively discounting fares led to a 12.8% decrease in passenger yields year over year. As a result of this pricing environment, TRASM in 2015 was 10.08 cents, a decrease of 14.7% compared to the prior year period. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.6%, year over year, from $135.14 to $119.49 driven by a decrease of 18.5% in ticket revenue per passenger flight segment.\nOur total non-ticket revenue increased by 23.6%, or $185.5 million, to $972.1 million in 2015. Despite the increased competitive pressures during 2015, our average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment remained relatively stable with a decline of only 1.4%, to $54.24. Our unbundling model provides a more stable revenue stream as demonstrated during periods of lower passenger ticket yields.\nOur operating cost structure is a primary area of focus and is at the core of our ULCC business model in which we compete solely on the basis of price. Our unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the United States. During 2015, our adjusted CASM ex-fuel decreased by 6.5% to 5.50 cents. The decrease on a per unit basis was primarily due to a decrease in aircraft rent and in salaries, wages and benefits. The decrease in aircraft rent per ASM was driven by a change in the mix of leased and purchased aircraft. Labor expense per ASM in 2015 was lower, as compared to prior year, due to scale benefits from overall growth and the introduction of larger gauge aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the depreciation of purchased aircraft.\nDuring 2015, we took delivery of 14 new aircraft, of which 11 are financed through senior and junior long-term debt and 3 are financed through an EETC. This EETC was our first aircraft-backed bond publicly offered by the Company. As of December 31, 2015, our 79 Airbus A320-family aircraft fleet was comprised of 29 A319s, 42 A320s and 8 A321s, of which 18 are owned and 61 are financed under operating leases. As of December 31, 2015, our aircraft orders consisted of 87 A320 family aircraft with Airbus and an additional 5 direct operating leases for A320neos with a third party, scheduled for delivery from 2016 through 2021.\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and non-ticket revenues.\nPassenger Revenues. Passenger revenues consist of the base fares that customers pay for air travel.\nNon-ticket Revenues. Non-ticket revenues are generated from air travel-related charges for baggage, passenger usage fee (PUF) for bookings through certain of our distribution channels, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, hotel and rental car travel packages and loyalty programs such as our FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program and $9 Fare Club. Non-ticket revenues also include revenues derived from the sale of advertising to third parties on our website and on board our aircraft.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Passenger revenues, as well as most non-ticket revenues, are recognized once the related flight departs. Accordingly, the value of tickets and portions of non-ticket revenues sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability,\u201d or ATL, until the related air travel is provided. Some of our non-ticket revenues are recognized at the time the ancillary products are purchased or ancillary services are provided, such as revenues from our subscription-based $9 Fare Club, which we recognize on a straight-line basis over 12\nmonths. Revenue generated from the FREE SPIRIT credit card affinity program are recognized in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2009-13. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Frequent Flier Program.\u201d\nWe recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees, which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets, but are not included in our revenues. We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following line items.\nAircraft Fuel. Aircraft fuel expense is our single largest operating expense. It includes the cost of jet fuel, related federal taxes, fueling into-plane fees and transportation fees. It also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from any activity on our fuel derivatives. Our fuel derivatives generally consist of United States Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps (jet fuel swaps) and United States Gulf Coast jet fuel options (jet fuel options).\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits expense includes the salaries, hourly wages, bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services, as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense consists of monthly lease rents for aircraft and spare engines under the terms of the related operating leases and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent. Supplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid or expected to be paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed and lease return condition obligations which we begin to accrue when they are probable. Aircraft rent expense is net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions on our flight equipment. As of December 31, 2015, 61 of our 79 aircraft and all of our 11 spare engines are financed under operating leases.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. Landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses, such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities, overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility.\nDistribution. Distribution expense includes all of our direct costs including the cost of web support, our third-party call center, travel agent commissions and related GDS fees and credit card transaction fees, associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense includes parts, materials, repairs and fees for repairs performed by third-party vendors directly required to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which is included under salaries, wages and benefits. It also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses, which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements. It also includes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses we defer under the deferral method of accounting for heavy maintenance events and recognize into expense on a straight-line or usage basis until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third-party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses, passenger re-accommodation expense, the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance, all other insurance policies except for employee related insurance, travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel, professional fees, personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses. No individual item included in this category represented more than 5% of our total operating expenses.\nSpecial Charges. Special charges include termination costs and secondary offering costs.\nOther Expense (Income)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft. For 2014, interest expense primarily represented interest related to the financing of purchased aircraft, interest related to the underpayment of prior year jet fuel FET and interest charged under the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA). Interest expense in 2013 primarily related to interest on the TRA. For a detailed discussion of the TRA, see Notes to the Financial Statements-17. Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nCapitalized Interest. Capitalized interest represents interest cost incurred during the acquisition period of an aircraft which theoretically could have been avoided had we not made PDPs for that aircraft. The percent of interest expense capitalized is equal to the amount of interest which could have been avoided. As such, if the amount of PDPs on deposit is less than the amount of related debt on which interest is incurred, then only a percent of total incurred interest expense qualifies for capitalization. These amounts are capitalized as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery. Capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest for 2015 primarily related to the interest incurred on long-term debt. For 2014, capitalized interest related to interest incurred on long-term debt, underpayment of prior year jet fuel FET and interest charged under the TRA. For 2013, capitalized interest related to interest incurred in connection with payments owed under the TRA.\nInterest Income. For 2015, interest income was related to interest earned on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our EETC. For a detailed discussion of the EETC, see Notes to the Financial Statements-9. Debt and Other Obligations.\u201d\nOther Expense. For 2014, other expense included $1.4 million related to the tax receivable settlement amount in excess of the amount previously accrued for. In addition, for 2014, other expense included a charitable contribution of $1.0 million that is specifically creditable against current income tax in the State of Florida, as allowed under state law.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nIn connection with our IPO in 2011, we entered into the TRA and thereby distributed immediately prior to the completion of the IPO to the holders of common stock as of such time, or the Pre-IPO Stockholders, the right to receive an amount equal to 90% of the cash savings in federal income tax realized by it by virtue of the use of the federal net operating loss, deferred interest deductions and alternative minimum tax credits held by us as of March 31, 2011, which was defined as the Pre-IPO NOL. Cash tax savings were generally computed by comparing actual federal income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such Pre-IPO NOLs (as defined in the TRA) not been available. Upon consummation of the IPO and execution of the TRA, we recorded a liability with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital. The amount and timing of payments under the TRA depended upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of taxable income generated in future periods and any limitations that may have been imposed on our ability to use the Pre-IPO NOLs. The term of the TRA was to continue until the first to occur (a) the full payment of all amounts required under the agreement with respect to utilization or expiration of all of the Pre-IPO NOLs, (b) the end of the taxable year including the tenth anniversary of the IPO or (c) a change in control of the Company.\nIn accordance with the TRA, we were required to submit a Tax Benefit Schedule showing the proposed TRA payout amount to the Stockholder Representatives within 45 calendar days of filing our tax return. Stockholder Representatives were defined as Indigo Pacific Partners, LLC and OCM FIE, LLC, representing the two largest ownership interest of pre-IPO shares. The Tax Benefit Schedule was to become final and binding on all parties unless a Stockholder Representative, within 45 calendar days after receiving such schedule, provided us with notice of a material objection to such schedule. If the parties, for any reason, were unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in any notice within 30 calendar days of receipt of such notice, we and the Stockholder Representatives had the right to employ the reconciliation procedures as set forth in the TRA. If the Tax Benefit Schedule was accepted, we then had five days after acceptance to make payments to the Pre-IPO stockholders. Pursuant to the TRA's reconciliation procedures, any disputes that could not be settled amicably, were to be settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator jointly selected by both parties.\nDuring the second quarter of 2012, we paid $27.2 million, or 90% of the 2011 tax savings realized from the utilization of NOLs, including $0.3 million of applicable interest, to the Pre-IPO Stockholders.\nDuring 2013, we filed an amended 2009 income tax return which resulted in a reduction to the estimated TRA liability from $8.0 million to $5.6 million. On September 13, 2013, we filed our 2012 federal income tax return, and on October 14, 2013, we submitted a Tax Benefit Schedule to the Stockholder Representatives. On November 27, 2013, pursuant to the TRA, we received an objection notice to the Tax Benefit Schedule from the Stockholder Representatives. On April 7, 2014, we received a demand for arbitration from the Stockholder Representatives. Prior to commencing arbitration proceedings, on June 17, 2014, we and Stockholder Representatives agreed on a settlement amount of $7.0 million in addition to interest of $0.3 million. The agreed upon settlement was in excess of the outstanding liability of $5.6 million at the time of settlement. The excess payment of $1.4 million was recorded within other expense in the statement of operations and recorded as cash from operations in the statement of cash flows. We have made all payments in accordance with the agreed upon settlement terms and have no outstanding obligations related to the TRA.\nTrends and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors affecting airlines and their markets, trends affecting the broader travel industry and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target. The following key factors may affect our future performance.\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record, reputation, code-sharing relationships, frequent flier programs and redemption opportunities. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flier initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to maximize unit revenue. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell.\nIn 2015, the airline industry saw greater and more persistent price discounting than in the preceding several years. A major reason enabling price discounting was the sharp decline in petroleum prices on world markets during the last couple years, which increased airline profitability and more than offset general increases in non-fuel costs. In addition, significant airline capacity increases in certain major cities - such as Dallas and Chicago - exerted strong downward price pressure in those markets. Finally, beginning in mid-2015 network carriers began seeking to match low-cost carrier and ULCC pricing on portions of their marginal unsold capacity, particularly in their key hub markets.\nAbsent significant increases in fuel prices and more constrained capacity, we expect the discounting trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the network carriers have developed, or are in process of developing, a fare-class pricing approach, in which a portion of available seats may be sold at or near ULCC prices, but without most product features available to their passengers paying at higher fare levels on the same flight. Broad fare discounting can have the effect of diluting the profitability of revenues of network carriers, which have units costs significantly above those of ULCCs, but the fare-class approach may allow network carriers to continue offering a competitive price to ULCCs on some flights or routes, while maintaining higher pricing to their traditional constituencies of business and more affluent travelers.\nSeasonality and Volatility. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past. We believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low-price travel. Finally, a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as South Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Northeast and northern Midwest regions of the United States, which are particularly vulnerable to weather, airport traffic constraints and other delays.\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel costs represent the single largest operating expense for most airlines, including ours. Fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years. Fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity, periods of market surplus and shortage and demand for heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as meteorological, economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast United States, particularly facilities\nadjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf Coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions, particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred, or when the threat of weather-related disruptions has caused Gulf Coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources. Our derivatives, from time to time, generally may consist of United States Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps (jet fuel swaps) and United States Gulf Coast jet fuel options (jet fuel options). Both jet fuel swaps and jet fuel options can be used at times to protect the refining price risk between the price of crude oil and the price of refined jet fuel, and to manage the risk of increasing fuel prices. Our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors, including our assessment of market conditions for fuel, our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements, the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market, our overall appetite for risk and applicable regulatory policies. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding jet fuel derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, we purchased all of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract. The cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain amendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new CBA, or the parties have been released to self-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lockouts.\nWe have four union-represented employee groups comprising approximately 73% of our employees at December 31, 2015. Our pilots are represented by the Airline Pilots Association, International, or ALPA, our flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, or AFA-CWA, our flight dispatchers are represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU, and our ramp service agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW. Conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages. In June 2010, we experienced a five-day strike by our pilots, which caused us to shut down our flight operations. The strike ended as a result of our reaching a tentative agreement under a Return to Work Agreement and a full flight schedule was resumed on June 18, 2010. On August 1, 2010, we entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement with our pilots. In August 2015, our CBA with our pilots became amendable and we are currently in discussions with ALPA regarding a new contract. In August 2013, we entered into a five-year agreement with our flight dispatchers. In August 2014, with the help of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. The tentative agreement was subject to ratification by the flight attendant membership. On October 1, 2014, we were notified that the flight attendants voted to not ratify the tentative agreement. We will continue to work together with the AFA-CWA and the NMB with a goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. On July 8, 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, including material economic terms, and we are in the process of negotiating a final collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW. We believe the five-year term of our CBAs is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs and provide us with competitive labor costs compared to other U.S.-based low-cost carriers. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their CBAs, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, such as the strike by our pilots in June 2010. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Any agreement we do reach could increase our labor and related expenses.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed into law. While much of the cost of the healthcare legislation enacted will occur after 2015 due to provisions of the legislation being delayed and phased in over time, we expect changes to our healthcare cost structure could potentially increase our operating costs, with healthcare costs increasing at a higher rate than our employee headcount.\nMaintenance Expense. Maintenance expense grew through 2015, 2014 and 2013 mainly as a result of a growing fleet and the gradual increase of required maintenance for the older aircraft in our fleet. As the fleet ages, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms. The amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates, average stage length, the interval between heavy maintenance events, the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time. However, we believe, based on our scheduled maintenance events, maintenance expense and maintenance-related amortization expense in 2016 will be approximately $164 million. In addition, we expect to capitalize $92 million of costs for heavy maintenance during 2016.\nAs a result of a significant portion of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time, heavy maintenance scheduled on each of our planes will occur at roughly the same time, meaning we will incur our most expensive\nscheduled maintenance obligations across our current fleet around the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service. When accounting for maintenance expense under the deferral method, heavy maintenance is amortized over the shorter of either the remaining lease term or the next estimated heavy maintenance event. As a result, deferred maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will generally have shorter amortization periods than those occurring earlier in the lease term. This will create higher depreciation and amortization expense specific to any aircraft related to heavy maintenance during the final years of the lease as compared to earlier periods. Please see - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Aircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization.\u201d\nMaintenance Reserve Obligations. The terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to post deposits for future maintenance, also known as maintenance reserves, to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our balance sheet. As a result, the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Aircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization\u201d and -Maintenance Reserves.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, please see Notes to Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenues from tickets sold are initially deferred as ATL. Passenger revenues are recognized when transportation is provided. An unused non-refundable ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue for the expired ticket value at the date of scheduled travel.\nOur most significant non-ticket revenues include revenues generated from air travel-related services paid for baggage, passenger usage fees, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, and loyalty programs. The majority of our non-ticket revenues are recognized once the related flight departs. Some of our non-ticket revenues, such as those related to itinerary changes, are recognized at the time products are purchased or services are provided. These revenues also include commissions from the sales of hotel rooms, trip insurance and rental cars recognized at the time the service is rendered. Non-ticket revenues also include revenues from our subscription-based $9 Fare Club, recognized on a straight-line basis over 12 months.\nCustomers may elect to change their itinerary prior to the date of departure. A service charge is assessed and recognized on the date the change is initiated and is deducted from the face value of the original purchase price of the ticket, and the original ticket becomes invalid. The amount remaining after deducting the service charge is called a credit shell which expires 60 days from the date the credit shell is created and can be used towards the purchase of a new ticket and our other service offerings. The amount of credits expected to expire unused is recognized as revenue upon issuance of the credit and is estimated based on historical experience. Estimating the amount of credits that will go unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment.\nFrequent Flier Program. We accrue for mileage credits earned through travel, including mileage credits for members with an insufficient number of mileage credits to earn an award, under our FREE SPIRIT program based on the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for credits that are expected to be redeemed. Incremental costs include fuel, insurance, security, ticketing and facility charges reduced by an estimate of amounts required to be paid by the passenger when redeeming the award.\nUnder our affinity card program, funds received for the marketing of a co-branded Spirit credit card and delivery of award miles are accounted for as a multiple-deliverable arrangement. At the inception of the arrangement, we evaluated all deliverables in the arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. We determined the arrangement had three separate units of accounting: (i) travel miles to be awarded, (ii) licensing of brand and access to member lists and (iii) advertising and marketing efforts. At inception of the arrangement, we established the estimated selling price for all deliverables that qualified for separation, as arrangement consideration should be allocated based on relative selling price. The manner in which the selling price was established was based on the applicable hierarchy of evidence. Total arrangement consideration was then allocated to each deliverable on the basis of the deliverable's relative selling price. In considering the\nhierarchy of evidence, we first determined whether vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price or third-party evidence of selling price existed. We determined that neither vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price nor third-party evidence existed due to the uniqueness of our program. As such, we developed our best estimate of the selling price for all deliverables. For the selling price of travel, we considered a number of entity-specific factors including the number of miles needed to redeem an award, average fare of comparable segments, breakage, restrictions, fees to redeem miles and other charges. For licensing of brand and access to member lists, we considered both market-specific factors and entity-specific factors, including general profit margins realized in the marketplace/industry, brand power, market royalty rates and size of customer base. For the advertising and marketing element, we considered market-specific factors and entity-specific factors including, our internal costs (and fluctuations of costs) of providing services, volume of marketing efforts and overall advertising plan. Consideration allocated based on the relative selling price to both brand licensing and advertising elements is recognized as revenue when earned and recorded in non-ticket revenue. Consideration allocated to award miles is deferred and recognized ratably as passenger revenue over the estimated period the transportation is expected to be provided which is currently estimated at 14 months. We used entity-specific assumptions coupled with the various judgments necessary to determine the selling price of a deliverable in accordance with the required selling price hierarchy. Changes in these assumptions could result in changes in the estimated selling prices. Determining the frequency to reassess selling price for individual deliverables requires significant judgment. For additional information, please see Notes to Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Frequent Flier Program\u201d.\nAccounting for property and equipment. Property and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of operating property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method applied to each unit of property. Property under capital leases and related obligations are initially recorded at an amount equal to the present value of future minimum lease payments computed using our incremental borrowing rate or, when known, the interest rate implicit in the lease. Amortization of property under capital leases is on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in depreciation and amortization expense. In accounting for property and equipment, we must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets, the expected residual values of the assets, and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and their future expected cash flows.\nThe depreciable lives used for the principal depreciable asset classifications are:\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated Useful Life\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft\n</td> <td>25 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Spare rotables and flight assemblies\n</td> <td>7 to 15 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other equipment and vehicles\n</td> <td>5 to 7 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Internal use software\n</td> <td>3 to 10 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease\n</td> <td>Lease term\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasehold improvements\n</td> <td>Lesser of lease term or estimated useful life of the improvement\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 18 aircraft capitalized within flight equipment with depreciable lives of 25 years and 61 aircraft financed through operating leases with terms of 3 to 15 years. All spare engines are financed through operating leases with terms of 7 to 12 years. Residual values for aircraft, major spare rotable parts, avionics and assemblies are estimated to be 10%.\nWe record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired, the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets, and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. In making these determinations, we use certain assumptions, including, but not limited to: (i) estimated fair value of the assets; and (ii) estimated, undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets, which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization, length of service the asset will be used in our operations, and estimated salvage values.\nAircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization. We account for heavy maintenance under the deferral method. Under the deferral method the cost of heavy maintenance is capitalized and amortized as a component of depreciation and amortization expense over the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term or useful life of the aircraft. Management expects that heavy maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will be amortized over the remaining lease term rather than over the next estimated heavy maintenance event. Amortization of engine and aircraft overhaul costs was $43.1 million, $35.8 million and $23.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. If heavy maintenance costs were amortized within maintenance, material and repairs expense in the statement of operations, our maintenance, material and repairs expense would have been\n$123.6 million, $109.8 million and $83.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we capitalized $9.1 million, $33.6 million and $70.8 million of costs for heavy maintenance, respectively. The timing of the next heavy maintenance event is estimated based on assumptions including estimated usage, FAA-mandated maintenance intervals, current condition of the related component, the age of the related component and average removal times as suggested by the manufacturer. These assumptions may change based on changes in our utilization of our aircraft, changes in government regulations and suggested manufacturer maintenance intervals. In addition, these assumptions can be affected by unplanned incidents that could damage an airframe, engine or major component to a level that would require a heavy maintenance event prior to a scheduled maintenance event. To the extent the estimated timing of the next maintenance event is extended or shortened, the related amortization period would be lengthened or shortened, resulting in higher amortization expense over a shorter period or lower amortization expense over a longer period, respectively. Heavy maintenance events include 6-year and 12-year airframe checks, engine overhauls, LLP replacement and overhauls to major components. Certain maintenance functions are outsourced under contracts that require payment based on a performance measure such as flight hours. Costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contracts, where labor and materials price risks have been transferred to the service provider, are accrued based on contractual payment terms. Routine cost for maintaining the airframes and engines and line maintenance are charged to maintenance, materials and repairs expense as performed.\nMaintenance Reserves. Some of our master lease agreements provide that we pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors to be held as collateral in advance of our performance of major maintenance activities. These lease agreements provide that maintenance reserves are reimbursable to us upon completion of the maintenance event in an amount equal to either (1) the amount of the maintenance reserve held by the lessor associated with the specific maintenance event or (2) the qualifying costs related to the specific maintenance event. Substantially all of these maintenance reserve payments are calculated based on a utilization measure, such as flight hours or cycles and are used solely to collateralize the lessor for maintenance time run off the aircraft until the completion of the maintenance of the aircraft.\nAt lease inception and at each balance sheet date, we assess whether the maintenance reserve payments required by the master lease agreements are substantively and contractually related to the maintenance of the leased asset. Maintenance reserve payments that are substantively and contractually related to the maintenance of the leased asset are accounted for as maintenance deposits. Maintenance deposits expected to be recovered from lessors are reflected as aircraft maintenance deposits in the accompanying balance sheets. We make certain assumptions to determine the recoverability of maintenance deposits. These assumptions are based on various factors such as the estimated time between the maintenance events, the cost of future maintenance events and the number of flight hours the aircraft is estimated to be utilized before it is returned to the lessor. When it is not probable we will recover amounts currently on deposit with a lessor, such amounts are expensed as supplemental rent. We expensed $2.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.9 million of paid maintenance reserves as supplemental rent during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had aircraft maintenance deposits of $279.9 million and $250.0 million, respectively, on our balance sheets. We have concluded that these aircraft maintenance deposits are probable of recovery primarily due to the rate differential between the maintenance reserve payments and the expected cost for the related next maintenance event that the reserves serve to collateralize.\nThe master lease agreements also provide that most maintenance reserves held by the lessor at the expiration of the lease are nonrefundable to us and will be retained by the lessor. Consequently, we have determined that any usage-based maintenance reserve payments after the last major maintenance event are not substantively related to the maintenance of the leased asset and therefore are accounted for as contingent rent. Contingent rent is recorded at the time a non-refundable maintenance reserve payment is made that has been substantively determined to be contingent rent. Accordingly, management expects to incur contingent rent after the last major maintenance events resulting in higher rent expense in the final years of applicable leases. Maintenance reserves held by lessors that are refundable to us at the expiration of the lease are accounted for as aircraft maintenance deposits on the balance sheet when they are paid.\nLeased Aircraft Return Costs. Our aircraft lease agreements often contain provisions that require us to return aircraft airframes and engines to the lessor in a certain condition or pay an amount to the lessor based on the airframe and engine's actual return condition. Lease return costs include all costs that would be incurred at the return of the aircraft including costs incurred to repair the airframe and engines to the required condition as stipulated by the lease. Lease return costs could include, but are not limited to redelivery cost, redelivery crew cost, fuel, final inspections, reconfiguration of the cabin, repairs to the airframe, painting, overhaul of engines, replacement of components and checks. Lease return costs are recognized beginning when it is probable that such costs will be incurred and they can be estimated. Incurrence of lease return costs becomes probable and the amount of those costs can typically be estimated near the end of the lease term (that is, after the aircraft has completed its last maintenance cycle prior to being returned). When determining probability and estimated cost, there are various factors which need to be considered such as current condition of the aircraft, the age of the aircraft at lease expiration,\nnumber of hours run on the engines, number of cycles run on the airframe, projected number of hours run on the engine at the time of return, number of projected cycles run on the airframe at the time of return, the extent of repairs needed if any at return, return locations, current configuration of the aircraft, current paint of the aircraft, estimated escalation of cost of repairs and materials at the time of return, current flight hour agreement rates and future flight hour agreement rates. In addition, typically near the lease return date, the lessors may allow reserves to be applied as return condition consideration or pass on certain return provisions if they do not align with their current plans to remarket the aircraft. When costs become both probable and estimable, they are accrued on a straight-line basis as contingent rent, a component of supplemental rent, through the remaining lease term. Management expects return costs to be estimable near the end of the lease term, as such, contingent rent for related aircraft will be higher near the end of the lease term.\nResults of Operations\nIn 2015, we generated operating revenues of $2,141.5 million and operating income of $509.1 million resulting in a record 23.8% operating margin and net earnings of $317.2 million. In 2014, we generated operating revenues of $1,931.6 million and operating income of $355.3 million resulting in an 18.4% operating margin and net earnings of $225.5 million. Operating revenues increased year over year mainly as a result of a 27.1% increase in traffic. Increased operations resulted in higher operating expenses across the board which were mostly offset with a significant decrease in fuel costs due to lower fuel cost per gallon.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents grew to $803.6 million, an increase of $170.8 million compared to the prior year, mainly driven by cash from our operating activities offset by cash used to fund PDPs, capital expenditures and repurchases of common stock.\nOperating Revenues\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change 2015 versus 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% change 2014 versus 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended 2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Passenger (thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,169,338\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,144,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>986,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-ticket (thousands)\n</td> <td>972,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>786,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.7%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>668,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenue (thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,141,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,931,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,654,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenue per ASM (TRASM) (cents)\n</td> <td>10.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14.7)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average ticket revenue per passenger flight segment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment\n</td> <td>54.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.4)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue per passenger flight segment\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 compared to 2014\nOperating revenues increased by $209.9 million, or 10.9%, to $2,141.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in traffic of 27.1%, partially offset by a decrease in average yield of 12.8% to 11.90 cents. The decrease in average yield resulted from increased competitive pressures from major domestic network carriers aggressively discounting fare prices.\nTRASM for 2015 was 10.08 cents, a decrease of 14.7% compared to 2014, as a result of lower operating yields on relatively stable load factors. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.6% from $135.14 in 2014 to $119.49 in 2015. The year-over-year decrease in total revenue per passenger flight segment was driven by a decrease of 18.5% in ticket revenue per passenger flight segment, resulting from the increased competitive pressures noted during the period.\nDuring 2015, our average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment remained relatively stable, declining by 1.4%, or $0.79, to $54.24, despite the increased competitive pressures. Our unbundling model provides a more stable revenue stream as demonstrated during periods of lower passenger ticket yields. The decrease in non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment was primarily attributable to lower bag revenue and the outsourcing of our onboard catering to a third-party provider. The outsourcing of onboard catering resulted in improved operating margins. These declines, contributing to the decrease in non-ticket revenue, were partially offset by higher per segment convenience charges compared to the same period last year.\n2014 compared to 2013\nOperating revenues increased by $277.2 million, or 16.8%, to $1,931.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in traffic of 18.0%, offset slightly by a decrease in average yield of 1.1% to 13.64 cents.\nOur results for 2014 were driven by a capacity increase of 17.9% compared to 2013, while maintaining a high load factor of 86.7%. TRASM for 2014 was 11.82 cents, a decrease of 1.0% compared to 2013, as a result of lower operating yields on relatively stable load factors. Total revenue per passenger flight segment increased 1.4% from $133.27 in 2013 to $135.14 in 2014. The year-over-year increase in total revenue per passenger flight segment is due to higher non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment offset by lower ticket revenue per passenger flight segment.\nDuring 2014, we increased our average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment by 2.2%, or $1.19, to $55.03. Our total non-ticket revenue increased by 17.7%, or $118.2 million, to $786.6 million in 2014. The year-over-year increase in average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment was primarily driven by a higher volume of passengers electing to purchase seat assignments, largely due to a software update completed in 2014 that enables us to sell seat assignments through more channels as well as a more rigorous approach to managing our seat inventory. Additionally, in July 2013, we increased our passenger usage fee (PUF), helping to drive the increase in PUF fees year over year.\nOperating Expenses\nSince adopting our ULCC model, we have continuously sought to reduce our unit operating costs and have created one of the industry's lowest cost structures in the United States. The table below presents our operating expenses, as a percentage of operating revenue for the last three years, as well as unit operating costs (CASM).\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>

The decrease on a per-ASM basis was primarily due to a decrease in aircraft rent and labor costs. The decrease in our aircraft rent per ASM is related to the recent purchase of aircraft with lower ownership costs recorded under depreciation and amortization versus leased aircraft recorded under aircraft rent. This decrease in aircraft rent was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the depreciation of our recently purchased aircraft. Labor costs per ASM are lower in 2015, as compared to the prior period, primarily due to scale benefits from overall growth as well as from larger gauge aircraft.\nAircraft fuel expenses includes both into-plane expense (as defined below) and realized and unrealized net gains or losses from fuel derivatives. Into-plane fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the into-plane\u201d price, including taxes and fees. Into-plane fuel prices are affected by the global oil market, refining costs, transportation taxes and fees, which can vary by region in the United States and other countries where we operate. Into-plane fuel expense approximates cash paid to the supplier and does not reflect the effect of our fuel derivatives. Management chose not to elect hedge accounting on any fuel derivative instruments during 2015, 2014 or 2013 and, as a result, changes in the fair value of these fuel derivative contracts are recorded each period as a component of aircraft fuel expense.\nDuring the third quarter of 2014, we became aware of an underpayment of Federal Excise Tax (FET) for fuel purchases during the period between July 1, 2009 and August 31, 2014. An out of period jet fuel FET amount of $9.3 million is recorded within aircraft fuel in the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAircraft fuel expense, our largest operating cost as a percentage of operating expenses, decreased by 24.7% from $612.9 million in 2014 to $461.4 million in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a 39.1% decrease in fuel prices per gallon, partially offset by a 27.2% increase in fuel gallons consumed.\nThe elements of the changes in aircraft fuel expense are illustrated in the following table:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed\n</td> <td>255,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel cost per gallon\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>608,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses (gains) related to fuel derivative contracts, net\n</td> <td>10,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized losses (gains) related to fuel derivative contracts, net\n</td> <td>(3,880\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense (per statement of operations)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>461,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>612,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGulf Coast Jet indexed fuel is the basis for a substantial majority of our fuel consumption and is impacted by both the price of crude oil as well as increases or decreases in refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel. The into-plane fuel cost per gallon decrease of 41.3% was primarily a result of a decrease in jet fuel prices.\nIn 2015, we recognized $10.6 million of realized loss related to fuel derivatives consisting of $11.2 million of premiums paid for fuel options that expired during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 offset by $0.6 million of cash received from fuel options that settled during the period. In 2014, total realized loss related to fuel derivatives was $1.0 million which represents premiums paid for fuel options that expired during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. There was no cash received from fuel options that settled during 2014. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we paid $2.5 million and $9.7 million, respectively, in premiums to acquire fuel options. We had unrealized gains of $3.9 million and unrealized losses of $3.9 million related to mark to market adjustments in the fair value of our outstanding fuel derivatives during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nWe track economic fuel expense, which we believe is the best measure of the effect fuel prices are currently having on our business, because it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel used for our operations during the period. We define economic fuel expense as into-plane fuel expense and realized gains or losses on derivative contracts. The key difference between aircraft fuel expense, as recorded in our statement of operations, and economic fuel expense is unrealized mark-to-market changes in the value of aircraft fuel derivatives outstanding. In addition, in our calculation for economic fuel price for the prior year, we are excluding the out of period additional jet fuel FET amount of $9.3 million expensed in the third quarter of 2014. Many industry analysts evaluate airline results using economic fuel expense and it is used in our internal management reporting.\nThe elements of the changes in economic fuel expense are illustrated in the following table:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>454,747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>608,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized (gains) and losses related to fuel derivative contracts, net\n</td> <td>10,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out of period fuel federal excise tax\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>465,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(22.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed\n</td> <td>255,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel cost per gallon\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(39.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuel gallons consumed increased 27.2% as a result of increased operations, as evidenced by a 26.4% increase in block hours.\nLabor costs in 2015 increased by $64.2 million, or 20.5%, compared to 2014, due mainly to a 27.9% increase in our pilot and flight attendant workforce required to operate the 14 new aircraft deliveries in 2015, offset slightly by a decrease in bonus expense due to a failure to achieve bonus targets in 2015. On a per-ASM basis, labor costs decreased primarily due to scale benefits from overall growth and lower bonus expense on both a dollar and per ASM basis, offset slightly by rising health care costs which rose more than our capacity growth during the year.\nDuring 2015, aircraft rent increased $15.7 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by a full year's rent of the seven leased aircraft delivered throughout 2014. We did not take delivery of any leased aircraft during 2015. On a per-ASM basis, aircraft rent expense decreased due to a change in composition of our aircraft fleet between leased aircraft (for which rent expense is recorded under aircraft rent) and purchased aircraft (for which depreciation expense is recorded under depreciation and amortization). Since the prior year period, we have purchased and taken delivery of 14 aircraft, which increased capacity but had no effect on aircraft rent expense, as these assets were purchased and are being depreciated over their useful life. Had the respective aircraft been leased, the change in rent expense, on both a dollar and per-ASM basis, would have been greater than the increase currently experienced in depreciation and amortization as a result of these purchases.\nLanding fees and other rents for 2015 increased by $26.0 million, or 24.7%, compared to 2014 driven by increased flight volume. On a per-ASM basis, landing fees and other rents decreased slightly, year over year, primarily due to scale benefits from increased volume at our airports.\nThe increase in distribution expense of $11.8 million, or 15.7%, in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to increased sales volume. On a per-ASM basis, distribution expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in credit card fees resulting from a renegotiation with our primary credit card processor in late 2014 and a slight shift of sales from third-party travel agents to our website.\nThe following table shows our distribution channel usage:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Website\n</td> <td>63.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party travel agents\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Call center\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintenance, materials and repair costs increased by $6.5 million, or 8.8%, in 2015, as compared to 2014 . The increase in maintenance costs on a dollar basis was due to routine and ongoing maintenance on a growing fleet. On a per-unit basis, our growth outpaced the increase in maintenance costs during the period, as compared to the prior year period. In addition, the timing and mix of maintenance events resulted in lower cost events in the current year period as compared to the prior year period. On a per-unit basis, maintenance expense decreased due to the purchase of $13.0 million in rotable inventory that was made in the third quarter of 2014 to support our aircraft fleet. The expense for these rotables is recorded under depreciation and amortization expense instead of maintenance expense as in the prior year period when the rotables were leased from a third party. We expect maintenance expense to increase as our fleet continues to grow and age, resulting in the need for additional or more frequent repairs over time.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $26.9 million, or 57.3%, compared to the prior year period. The increase on both a dollar and per-ASM basis was primarily due to depreciation expense resulting from the purchase of 14 aircraft made during 2015.\nOther operating expenses in 2015 increased by $57.2 million, or 38.2%, compared to 2014, primarily due to an increase in departures of 25.6%, our overall growth and an increase in passenger re-accommodation expense year over year. On a per-ASM basis, our other operating expenses increased primarily due to higher passenger re-accommodation expense. Re-accommodation expense was driven by an increased number of flight cancellations, as compared to the same period last year. For example, during the second quarter of 2015, we experienced consecutive storm systems in Dallas, Chicago, New York, and Detroit followed by Tropical Storm Bill that sat over Houston before moving north to Dallas. The timing and location of these storm systems produced a domino effect on our operations resulting in over 500 flight cancellations and numerous flight delays. Our travel and lodging expense was also higher, as compared to the prior year period, due to increased operations, the training of new pilots and flight attendants, and higher average lodging rates.\n2014 compared to 2013\nOperating expense increased by $204.2 million, or 14.9%, in 2014 primarily due to our 17.9% growth in capacity as well as higher amortization of heavy maintenance events on our aircraft.\nOur adjusted CASM ex fuel for 2014 decreased by 0.5% as compared to 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower passenger re-accommodation expense year over year, due to better operational performance during 2014, as compared to 2013. In addition, on a per-ASM basis, distribution expense decreased, primarily due to a $2.9 million settlement gain received in 2014, and aircraft rent expense decreased due to reduced rent expense related to 14 A319 aircraft for which lease extensions with reduced rates were negotiated with the lessor at the end of the second quarter of 2013, providing for a full year of benefit in 2014 versus 7 months of benefit in 2013. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, landing fees and other rents expense, salaries, wages and benefits expense, and maintenance, materials and repairs expense per ASM.\nAircraft fuel expense increased by 11.1% from $551.7 million in 2013 to $612.9 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to a 16.6% increase in fuel gallons consumed as well as an additional $9.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2014 for unpaid jet fuel FET related to prior years, partially offset by a 6.9% decrease in fuel prices per gallon.\nThe elements of the changes in aircraft fuel expense are illustrated in the following table:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed\n</td> <td>200,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel cost per gallon\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>608,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>542,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized losses (gains) related to fuel derivative contracts, net\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized losses (gains) related to fuel derivative contracts, net\n</td> <td>3,881\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aircraft fuel expense (per statement of operations)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>612,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>551,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe into-plane fuel cost per gallon decrease of 4.1% was primarily a result of a decrease in jet fuel prices partially offset by an additional $9.3 million for prior year unpaid jet fuel FET recorded in the third quarter of 2014.\nThe elements of the changes in economic fuel expense are illustrated in the following table:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except per gallon amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Into-plane fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>608,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>542,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Realized (gains) and losses related to fuel derivative contracts, net\n</td> <td>995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Out of period fuel federal excise tax\n</td> <td>(9,278\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>599,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>551,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel gallons consumed\n</td> <td>200,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Economic fuel cost per gallon\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuel gallons consumed increased 16.6% as a result of increased operations, as evidenced by a 15.6% increase in block hours.\nWe did not pay or receive cash from any fuel derivatives that settled during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Total net loss recognized for derivatives that settled during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 was $9.0 million. This amount represents the net cash paid for the settlement of derivatives. We paid $1.0 million in premiums for fuel options which expired during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014. We did not have any fuel options expire during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013. We had $3.9 million in unrealized gains and losses related to our outstanding fuel derivatives during\nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2014. Total unrealized losses arising from mark-to-market adjustments to our outstanding fuel derivatives for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 was $0.3 million.\nLabor costs in 2014 increased by $51.8 million, or 19.8%, compared to 2013, due mainly to a 19.1% increase in our pilot and flight attendant workforce required to operate the eleven new aircraft deliveries in 2014 and the implementation of new crew duty and rest rules (FAR 117) beginning in January of 2014, which resulted in the hiring of additional pilots to fly our schedule. On a per-ASM basis, labor costs increased primarily due to an increase in our group health care costs and the implementation of FAR 117, which resulted in carrying a higher ratio of pilots compared to the prior period.\nDuring 2014, aircraft rent increased $26.1 million, or 15.4%, compared to 2013. This increase was primarily driven by the delivery of seven new leased aircraft during 2014. On a per-ASM basis, aircraft rent expense decreased due to lease extensions that effectively lowered the lease rate for 14 A319 aircraft at the end of the second quarter of 2013, providing for a full year of benefit in 2014 versus 7 months of benefit in 2013. In addition, we had the delivery of four purchased aircraft during the fourth quarter of 2014 that increased capacity but had no affect on aircraft rent expense as these assets are being depreciated over their useful life.\nLanding fees and other rents for 2014 increased by $21.5 million, or 25.7%, compared to 2013 primarily due to a 13.6% increase in departures as well as increased volume at higher cost airports. On a per-ASM basis, landing fees and other rents increased, as compared to the prior year period, due to increased rates at certain airports, expiration of incentives, as well as increased volume at higher-cost airports.\nThe increase in distribution expense of $7.3 million, or 10.9%, in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased sales volume and an increase of approximately 0.9 percentage points, year over year, in sales from third-party travel agents, which are more expensive than selling directly through our website. On a per-ASM basis, distribution expense decreased primarily due to a $2.9 million settlement gain received in 2014.\nThe following table shows our distribution channel usage:\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Website\n</td> <td>61.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party travel agents\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Call center\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nMaintenance, materials and repair costs increased by $13.8 million, or 23.0%, in 2014, as compared to 2013. The increase in maintenance costs was primarily due to the aging of our fleet, which requires more comprehensive work during routine scheduled maintenance, as well as the timing of the mix of maintenance checks performed during 2014 as compared to 2013. In addition, during the third quarter of 2014, we recorded $2.3 million of expense in connection with an engine failure incident that occurred in 2013. For a detailed discussion of the engine expense, please see Notes to the Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d. In addition, the increase in maintenance costs on a dollar basis and per unit basis resulted from an increase in both the number and cost of scheduled maintenance events during the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year. We expect maintenance expense to increase significantly as our fleet continues to grow and age, resulting in the need for additional or more frequent repairs over time.\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $15.0 million, or 47.0%, primarily due to higher amortization of deferred heavy maintenance. As our fleet continues to age, the amount of deferred heavy maintenance events capitalized will increase and will result in an increase in the amortization of those costs.\nOther operating expenses in 2014 increased by $5.1 million, or 3.5%, compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in departures of 13.6% and our overall growth. On a per-ASM basis, our other operating expenses decreased, as compared to the same period in 2013, due to lower passenger re-accommodation expense resulting from improved operational reliability.\nOther (income) expense, net\n2015 compared to 2014\nOther (income) expense, net increased from $2.3 million in 2014 to $6.7 million in 2015. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense of $17.6 million, which primarily represented interest related to the financing of purchased aircraft, offset by an increase in the capitalization of interest of $8.8 million. Additionally, interest income increased by $1.8 million, year over year, as we earned interest income on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our EETC. See Notes to the Financial Statements-9. Debt and Other Obligations\u201d for additional information.\n2014 compared to 2013\nOther (income) expense, net decreased from $(0.1) million in 2013 to $2.3 million in 2014. The decrease was primarily driven by a $7.0 million payment made to the Stockholder Representatives in accordance with the TRA of which $1.4 million was in excess of the amount previously accrued and was recorded within other (income) expense in the statement of operations. See Notes to the Financial Statements-17. Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information. In addition, we made a charitable contribution of $1.0 million that is specifically creditable against current income tax in the State of Florida, as allowed under state law, and recorded within other expense in the statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2015, our effective tax rate was 36.9% compared to 36.1% in 2014 and 37.4% in 2013. While we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term, it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income. Discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates.\nQuarterly Financial Data (unaudited)\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

special charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash provided by operations and capital from asset financing. Primary uses of liquidity are for working capital needs, capital expenditures, aircraft pre-delivery deposit payments (PDPs) and maintenance reserves. Our total cash at December 31, 2015 was $803.6 million, an increase of $170.8 million from December 31, 2014.\nCurrently, our single largest capital need is to fund the acquisition costs of our aircraft. Aircraft are acquired through sale leaseback transactions or debt financing. In sale leaseback transactions, capital is needed to fund the initial purchase of the aircraft prior to the sale to the lessor. During 2015, we entered into one sale leaseback transaction for an engine and no aircraft sale leaseback transactions. In debt financing transactions, capital is needed to make equity investments in capital assets and payments on debt obligations (principal and interest) after the acquisition of the aircraft. In 2015, we purchased 14 aircraft through debt financing transactions and made $41.6 million in debt payment obligations (principal and interest). The debt entered into in the current year had maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2028 and interest rates ranging from 4.0% to 6.9%. Capital resources required under debt financing transactions will generally be higher than those involving sale leaseback transactions.\nPDPs relating to future deliveries under our agreement with Airbus are required at various times prior to each delivery date. During 2015, $48.4 million of PDPs have been returned related to delivered aircraft in the period and we paid $190.7 million in PDPs for future deliveries of aircraft and spare engines. As of December 31, 2015, we have secured financing for twelve aircraft deliveries from Airbus and for five aircraft to be leased directly from a third party, all scheduled for delivery in 2016. We do not have financing commitments in place for the remaining 75 Airbus firm aircraft orders scheduled for delivery between 2017 and 2021.\nIn addition to funding the acquisition of our future fleet, we are required to make maintenance reserve payments for some of the aircraft in our current fleet. Maintenance reserves are paid to aircraft lessors and are held as collateral in advance of our performance of major maintenance activities. In 2015, we paid $59.2 million in maintenance reserves and as of December 31, 2015, we have $279.9 million ($73.4 million in aircraft maintenance deposits and $206.5 million in long-term aircraft maintenance deposits) on our balance sheet.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we were compliant with our credit card processing agreements, and not subject to any credit card holdbacks. The maximum potential exposure to cash holdbacks by our credit card processors, based upon advance ticket sales and $9 Fare Club memberships, as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was $250.2 million and $217.1 million, respectively.\nIn 2014, we agreed on a settlement amount of $7.0 million related to the TRA. This agreed upon settlement was in excess of the outstanding liability of $5.6 million at the time of settlement. The $5.6 million payment is recorded as cash used in financing activities in the statement of cash flows and the excess payment of $1.4 million is recorded within other expense in the statement operations and recorded as cash from operations in the statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2014, we had made all payments in accordance with the agreed upon settlement terms and have no outstanding obligations related to the TRA. See Notes to the Financial Statements-17. Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information regarding the TRA.\nNet Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities. Operating activities in 2015 provided $473.0 million in cash compared to $260.5 million provided in 2014. The increase resulted from higher net income, larger cash collections on flights sold but not yet flown, and higher deferrals of income taxes year over year.\nOperating activities in 2014 provided $260.5 million in cash compared to $195.4 million provided in 2013. The increase was primarily due to higher net income in 2014 coupled with a higher deferral of income taxes.\nNet Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. During 2015, investing activities used $701.3 million, compared to $302.4 million used in 2014. The increase was mainly due to the purchase of 14 aircraft and 1 spare engine sale leaseback transaction during 2015 and a slight increase in paid PDPs, as compared to 2014, driven by the timing of aircraft deliveries.\nDuring 2014, investing activities used $302.4 million, compared to $90.1 million used in 2013. The increase was mainly due to the purchase of four Airbus A320s and one spare engine sale leaseback transaction during 2014 and an increase in paid PDPs as compared to 2013, driven by the timing of aircraft deliveries.\nNet Cash Provided By Financing Activities. During 2015, financing activities provided $399.1 million. We received $7.3 million in proceeds from the sale of one spare engine as part of a sale and leaseback transaction, $536.8 million in connection with the debt financing of 14 aircraft, and retained $8.9 million as a result of excess tax benefits related to share-based\npayments. We spent $15.2 million in debt issuance costs to secure the financing on 14 aircraft purchases, spent $112.3 million to repurchase common stock and made $26.4 million in debt and capital lease payments.\nDuring 2014, financing activities provided $144.0 million. We received $7.2 million in proceeds from the sale of one spare engine as part of a sale and leaseback transaction, $148.0 million in connection with the debt financing of four aircraft, retained $1.9 million as a result of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments and received cash as a result of exercised stock options. We spent $4.7 million in debt issuance costs to secure the financing on 4 aircraft delivered in 2014 and 11 aircraft delivered in 2015.\nDuring 2013, financing activities provided $8.5 million. We received $6.9 million in proceeds from the sale of one spare engine as part of sale and leaseback transactions, retained $1.9 million as a result of excess tax benefits related to share-based payments and received cash as a result of exercised stock options.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft and engines, payment of debt, and lease arrangements. The following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 and the periods in which payments are due (in millions):\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 - 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 and beyond\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>179\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>564\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Flight equipment purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total future payments on contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,897\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes principal only associated with senior term loans due through 2027, junior term loans due through 2022 and Class A and Class B enhanced equipment trust certificates due through 2028 and 2024, respectively.

Some maintenance reserve payments are fixed contractual amounts, while others are based on utilization. In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above, we have fixed maintenance reserve payments for these aircraft and related flight equipment, including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations, which are approximately $8.0 million in 2016, $7.4 million in 2017, $5.8 million in 2018, $4.2 million in 2019, $3.9 million in 2020 and $10.2 million in 2021 and beyond.\nIn August 2015, we created two separate pass-through trusts which issued $576.6 million aggregate face amount of Series 2015-1 Class A and Class B EETCs in connection with the financing of 15 aircraft to be delivered between October 2015 and December 2016. The proceeds from the issuance of EETCs were initially held in escrow by a depositary and, upon satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, will be released and used to purchase secured equipment notes to be issued as the new aircraft are delivered. As of December 31, 2015 we have taken delivery of three aircraft and the remaining twelve aircraft are scheduled to be delivered throughout 2016. Interest on the issued and outstanding equipment notes are payable semiannually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing on April 1, 2016 and principal on such equipment notes is scheduled for payment on April 1 and October 1 of certain years, commencing on October 1, 2016. Interest on the issued and outstanding equipment notes accrue at a blended rate of 4.15% per annum. Issued and outstanding Series A and Series B equipment notes mature in April 2028 and April 2024, respectively.\nWe evaluated whether the pass-through trusts formed are variable interest entities (VIEs) required to be consolidated by the Company under applicable accounting guidance. We determined that the pass-through trusts are VIEs and that we do not have a variable interest in the pass-through trusts. As such, we are not required to consolidate these pass-through trusts.\nIn September 2015, we executed a lease agreement with Wayne County Airport Authority (the Authority), which owns and operates Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport (DTW). Under the lease agreement, we lease a 10-acre site, adjacent to the airfield at DTW, in order to construct, operate and maintain an approximately 126,000 square foot hangar facility. The lease agreement has a 30-year term with two 10-year extension options. Upon termination of the lease, title of the project, which will be fully depreciated, will automatically pass to the Authority. We estimate we will complete the project during the third quarter of 2016. Future commitment amounts for the project are included within operating lease obligations in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have significant obligations for aircraft and spare engines as 61 of our 79 aircraft and all of our 11 spare engines are financed under operating leases and therefore are not reflected on our balance sheets. These leases expire between 2016 and 2027. Aircraft rent payments were $217.0 million and $198.7 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our aircraft lease payments for 56 of our aircraft are fixed-rate obligations. Five of our leases provide for variable rent payments, which fluctuate based on changes in LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate).\nOur contractual purchase commitments consist primarily of aircraft and engine acquisitions through manufacturer and aircraft leasing companies. As of December 31, 2015, our firm aircraft orders consisted of the following:\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Airbus\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Third-Party Lessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A320ceo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A320neo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A321ceo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A321neo\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A320neo (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) We have been notified by our third-party lessor that the delivery of one or more of these A320neos may be delayed until 2017. We do not believe this delay in delivery date to be significant.\nWe also have four spare engine orders for V2500 SelectOne engines with IAE and nine spare engine orders for PurePower PW 1100G-JM engines with Pratt & Whitney. Spare engines are scheduled for delivery from 2017 through 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had lines of credit related to corporate credit cards of $18.6 million from which we had drawn $7.3 million.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had lines of credit with counterparties for both physical fuel delivery and derivatives in the amount of $38.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had drawn $6.9 million on these lines of credit. We are required to post collateral for any excess above the lines of credit if the derivatives are in a net liability position and make periodic payments in order to maintain an adequate undrawn portion for physical fuel delivery. As of December 31, 2015, we did not hold any derivatives with requirements to post collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we have $5.6 million in uncollateralized surety bonds and a $25.1 million unsecured standby letter of credit facility, representing an off balance-sheet commitment, of which $13.0 million had been drawn upon for issued letters of credit.\nGLOSSARY OF AIRLINE TERMS\nSet forth below is a glossary of industry terms:\nAdjusted CASM\u201d means operating expenses, excluding unrealized gains or losses related to fuel derivative contracts, out of period fuel federal excise tax, loss on disposal of assets, and special charges (credits), divided by ASMs.\nAdjusted CASM ex fuel\u201d means operating expenses excluding aircraft fuel expense, loss on disposal of assets, and special charges (credits), divided by ASMs.\nAFA-CWA\u201d means the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA.\nAir traffic liability\u201d or ATL\u201d means the value of tickets sold in advance of travel.\nALPA\u201d means the Airline Pilots Association, International.\nASIF\u201d means an Aviation Security Infrastructure Fee assessed by the TSA on each airline.\nAvailable seat miles\u201d or ASMs\u201d means the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown, also referred to as \"capacity\".\nAverage aircraft\u201d means the average number of aircraft in our fleet as calculated on a daily basis.\nAverage daily aircraft utilization\u201d means block hours divided by number of days in the period divided by average aircraft.\nAverage economic fuel cost per gallon\u201d means total aircraft fuel expense, excluding unrealized gains or losses related to fuel derivative contracts and out of period fuel federal excise tax, divided by the total number of fuel gallons consumed.\nAverage non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment\u201d means the total non-ticket revenue divided by passenger flight segments.\nAverage ticket revenue per passenger flight segment\u201d means total passenger revenue divided by passenger flight segments.\nAverage stage length\u201d represents the average number of miles flown per flight.\nAverage yield\u201d means average operating revenue earned per RPM, calculated as total revenue divided by RPMs.\nBlock hours\u201d means the number of hours during which the aircraft is in revenue service, measured from the time of gate departure before take-off until the time of gate arrival at the destination.\nCASM\u201d or unit costs\u201d means operating expenses divided by ASMs.\nCBA\u201d means a collective bargaining agreement.\nCBP\u201d means United States Customs and Border Protection.\nDOT\u201d means the United States Department of Transportation.\nEPA\u201d means the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\"EETC\" means enhanced equipment trust certificate.\nFAA\u201d means the United States Federal Aviation Administration.\nFCC\u201d means the United States Federal Communications Commission.\n\"FLL Airport\" means the Fort Lauderdale Hollywood International Airport.\nGDS\u201d means Global Distribution System (e.g., Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and Worldspan).\n\"IAMAW\" means the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\nInto-plane fuel cost per gallon\u201d means into-plane fuel expense divided by number of fuel gallons consumed.\nInto-plane fuel expense\u201d represents the cost of jet fuel and certain other charges such as fuel taxes and oil.\nLoad factor\u201d means the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight (RPMs divided by ASMs).\nNMB\u201d means the National Mediation Board.\nTotal operating revenue per ASM,\u201d TRASM\u201d or unit revenue\u201d means operating revenue divided by ASMs.\nOTA\u201d means Online Travel Agent (e.g., Orbitz and Travelocity).\nPassenger flight segments\u201d means the total number of passengers flown on all flight segments.\nPDP\u201d means pre-delivery deposit payment.\nRevenue passenger mile\u201d or RPM\u201d means one revenue passenger transported one mile.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.\n2015 Year in Review\nThe year 2015 marks our ninth consecutive year of profitability. In 2015, we increased our capacity by 30.0%, as we grew our fleet of Airbus single-aisle aircraft from 65 to 79 aircraft, launched service to 40 new markets and added 1 new destination: Cleveland, Ohio.\nDuring 2015, we earned net income of $317.2 million ($4.38 per share, diluted), compared to net income of $225.5 million ($3.08 per share, diluted) in 2014. The increase in earnings was a result of our increased capacity as well as lower fuel and non-fuel unit costs, which allowed us to continue generating high profit margins.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we achieved an operating profit margin of 23.8%, the highest in our history, on $2,141.5 million in operating revenues. Our traffic grew by 27.1% as we continued to address an underserved market with ultra-low fares. Increased competitive pressures from major domestic network carriers aggressively discounting fares led to a 12.8% decrease in passenger yields year over year. As a result of this pricing environment, TRASM in 2015 was 10.08 cents, a decrease of 14.7% compared to the prior year period. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.6%, year over year, from $135.14 to $119.49 driven by a decrease of 18.5% in ticket revenue per passenger flight segment.\nOur total non-ticket revenue increased by 23.6%, or $185.5 million, to $972.1 million in 2015. Despite the increased competitive pressures during 2015, our average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment remained relatively stable with a decline of only 1.4%, to $54.24. Our unbundling model provides a more stable revenue stream as demonstrated during periods of lower passenger ticket yields.\nOur operating cost structure is a primary area of focus and is at the core of our ULCC business model in which we compete solely on the basis of price. Our unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the United States. During 2015, our adjusted CASM ex-fuel decreased by 6.5% to 5.50 cents. The decrease on a per unit basis was primarily due to a decrease in aircraft rent and in salaries, wages and benefits. The decrease in aircraft rent per ASM was driven by a change in the mix of leased and purchased aircraft. Labor expense per ASM in 2015 was lower, as compared to prior year, due to scale benefits from overall growth and the introduction of larger gauge aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the depreciation of purchased aircraft.\nDuring 2015, we took delivery of 14 new aircraft, of which 11 are financed through senior and junior long-term debt and 3 are financed through an EETC. This EETC was our first aircraft-backed bond publicly offered by the Company. As of December 31, 2015, our 79 Airbus A320-family aircraft fleet was comprised of 29 A319s, 42 A320s and 8 A321s, of which 18 are owned and 61 are financed under operating leases. As of December 31, 2015, our aircraft orders consisted of 87 A320 family aircraft with Airbus and an additional 5 direct operating leases for A320neos with a third party, scheduled for delivery from 2016 through 2021.\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and non-ticket revenues.\nPassenger Revenues. Passenger revenues consist of the base fares that customers pay for air travel.\nNon-ticket Revenues. Non-ticket revenues are generated from air travel-related charges for baggage, passenger usage fee (PUF) for bookings through certain of our distribution channels, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, hotel and rental car travel packages and loyalty programs such as our FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program and $9 Fare Club. Non-ticket revenues also include revenues derived from the sale of advertising to third parties on our website and on board our aircraft.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Passenger revenues, as well as most non-ticket revenues, are recognized once the related flight departs. Accordingly, the value of tickets and portions of non-ticket revenues sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability,\u201d or ATL, until the related air travel is provided. Some of our non-ticket revenues are recognized at the time the ancillary products are purchased or ancillary services are provided, such as revenues from our subscription-based $9 Fare Club, which we recognize on a straight-line basis over 12\nmonths. Revenue generated from the FREE SPIRIT credit card affinity program are recognized in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2009-13. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Frequent Flier Program.\u201d\nWe recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees, which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets, but are not included in our revenues. We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following line items.\nAircraft Fuel. Aircraft fuel expense is our single largest operating expense. It includes the cost of jet fuel, related federal taxes, fueling into-plane fees and transportation fees. It also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from any activity on our fuel derivatives. Our fuel derivatives generally consist of United States Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps (jet fuel swaps) and United States Gulf Coast jet fuel options (jet fuel options).\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits expense includes the salaries, hourly wages, bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services, as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense consists of monthly lease rents for aircraft and spare engines under the terms of the related operating leases and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent. Supplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid or expected to be paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed and lease return condition obligations which we begin to accrue when they are probable. Aircraft rent expense is net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions on our flight equipment. As of December 31, 2015, 61 of our 79 aircraft and all of our 11 spare engines are financed under operating leases.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. Landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses, such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities, overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility.\nDistribution. Distribution expense includes all of our direct costs including the cost of web support, our third-party call center, travel agent commissions and related GDS fees and credit card transaction fees, associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense includes parts, materials, repairs and fees for repairs performed by third-party vendors directly required to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which is included under salaries, wages and benefits. It also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses, which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements. It also includes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses we defer under the deferral method of accounting for heavy maintenance events and recognize into expense on a straight-line or usage basis until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third-party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses, passenger re-accommodation expense, the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance, all other insurance policies except for employee related insurance, travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel, professional fees, personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses. No individual item included in this category represented more than 5% of our total operating expenses.\nSpecial Charges. Special charges include termination costs and secondary offering costs.\nOther Expense (Income)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft. For 2014, interest expense primarily represented interest related to the financing of purchased aircraft, interest related to the underpayment of prior year jet fuel FET and interest charged under the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA). Interest expense in 2013 primarily related to interest on the TRA. For a detailed discussion of the TRA, see Notes to the Financial Statements-17. Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nCapitalized Interest. Capitalized interest represents interest cost incurred during the acquisition period of an aircraft which theoretically could have been avoided had we not made PDPs for that aircraft. The percent of interest expense capitalized is equal to the amount of interest which could have been avoided. As such, if the amount of PDPs on deposit is less than the amount of related debt on which interest is incurred, then only a percent of total incurred interest expense qualifies for capitalization. These amounts are capitalized as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery. Capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest for 2015 primarily related to the interest incurred on long-term debt. For 2014, capitalized interest related to interest incurred on long-term debt, underpayment of prior year jet fuel FET and interest charged under the TRA. For 2013, capitalized interest related to interest incurred in connection with payments owed under the TRA.\nInterest Income. For 2015, interest income was related to interest earned on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our EETC. For a detailed discussion of the EETC, see Notes to the Financial Statements-9. Debt and Other Obligations.\u201d\nOther Expense. For 2014, other expense included $1.4 million related to the tax receivable settlement amount in excess of the amount previously accrued for. In addition, for 2014, other expense included a charitable contribution of $1.0 million that is specifically creditable against current income tax in the State of Florida, as allowed under state law.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nIn connection with our IPO in 2011, we entered into the TRA and thereby distributed immediately prior to the completion of the IPO to the holders of common stock as of such time, or the Pre-IPO Stockholders, the right to receive an amount equal to 90% of the cash savings in federal income tax realized by it by virtue of the use of the federal net operating loss, deferred interest deductions and alternative minimum tax credits held by us as of March 31, 2011, which was defined as the Pre-IPO NOL. Cash tax savings were generally computed by comparing actual federal income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such Pre-IPO NOLs (as defined in the TRA) not been available. Upon consummation of the IPO and execution of the TRA, we recorded a liability with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital. The amount and timing of payments under the TRA depended upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of taxable income generated in future periods and any limitations that may have been imposed on our ability to use the Pre-IPO NOLs. The term of the TRA was to continue until the first to occur (a) the full payment of all amounts required under the agreement with respect to utilization or expiration of all of the Pre-IPO NOLs, (b) the end of the taxable year including the tenth anniversary of the IPO or (c) a change in control of the Company.\nIn accordance with the TRA, we were required to submit a Tax Benefit Schedule showing the proposed TRA payout amount to the Stockholder Representatives within 45 calendar days of filing our tax return. Stockholder Representatives were defined as Indigo Pacific Partners, LLC and OCM FIE, LLC, representing the two largest ownership interest of pre-IPO shares. The Tax Benefit Schedule was to become final and binding on all parties unless a Stockholder Representative, within 45 calendar days after receiving such schedule, provided us with notice of a material objection to such schedule. If the parties, for any reason, were unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in any notice within 30 calendar days of receipt of such notice, we and the Stockholder Representatives had the right to employ the reconciliation procedures as set forth in the TRA. If the Tax Benefit Schedule was accepted, we then had five days after acceptance to make payments to the Pre-IPO stockholders. Pursuant to the TRA's reconciliation procedures, any disputes that could not be settled amicably, were to be settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator jointly selected by both parties.\nDuring the second quarter of 2012, we paid $27.2 million, or 90% of the 2011 tax savings realized from the utilization of NOLs, including $0.3 million of applicable interest, to the Pre-IPO Stockholders.\nDuring 2013, we filed an amended 2009 income tax return which resulted in a reduction to the estimated TRA liability from $8.0 million to $5.6 million. On September 13, 2013, we filed our 2012 federal income tax return, and on October 14, 2013, we submitted a Tax Benefit Schedule to the Stockholder Representatives. On November 27, 2013, pursuant to the TRA, we received an objection notice to the Tax Benefit Schedule from the Stockholder Representatives. On April 7, 2014, we received a demand for arbitration from the Stockholder Representatives. Prior to commencing arbitration proceedings, on June 17, 2014, we and Stockholder Representatives agreed on a settlement amount of $7.0 million in addition to interest of $0.3 million. The agreed upon settlement was in excess of the outstanding liability of $5.6 million at the time of settlement. The excess payment of $1.4 million was recorded within other expense in the statement of operations and recorded as cash from operations in the statement of cash flows. We have made all payments in accordance with the agreed upon settlement terms and have no outstanding obligations related to the TRA.\nTrends and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors affecting airlines and their markets, trends affecting the broader travel industry and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target. The following key factors may affect our future performance.\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record, reputation, code-sharing relationships, frequent flier programs and redemption opportunities. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flier initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to maximize unit revenue. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell.\nIn 2015, the airline industry saw greater and more persistent price discounting than in the preceding several years. A major reason enabling price discounting was the sharp decline in petroleum prices on world markets during the last couple years, which increased airline profitability and more than offset general increases in non-fuel costs. In addition, significant airline capacity increases in certain major cities - such as Dallas and Chicago - exerted strong downward price pressure in those markets. Finally, beginning in mid-2015 network carriers began seeking to match low-cost carrier and ULCC pricing on portions of their marginal unsold capacity, particularly in their key hub markets.\nAbsent significant increases in fuel prices and more constrained capacity, we expect the discounting trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the network carriers have developed, or are in process of developing, a fare-class pricing approach, in which a portion of available seats may be sold at or near ULCC prices, but without most product features available to their passengers paying at higher fare levels on the same flight. Broad fare discounting can have the effect of diluting the profitability of revenues of network carriers, which have units costs significantly above those of ULCCs, but the fare-class approach may allow network carriers to continue offering a competitive price to ULCCs on some flights or routes, while maintaining higher pricing to their traditional constituencies of business and more affluent travelers.\nSeasonality and Volatility. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past. We believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low-price travel. Finally, a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as South Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Northeast and northern Midwest regions of the United States, which are particularly vulnerable to weather, airport traffic constraints and other delays.\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel costs represent the single largest operating expense for most airlines, including ours. Fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years. Fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity, periods of market surplus and shortage and demand for heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as meteorological, economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast United States, particularly facilities\nadjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf Coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions, particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred, or when the threat of weather-related disruptions has caused Gulf Coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources. Our derivatives, from time to time, generally may consist of United States Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps (jet fuel swaps) and United States Gulf Coast jet fuel options (jet fuel options). Both jet fuel swaps and jet fuel options can be used at times to protect the refining price risk between the price of crude oil and the price of refined jet fuel, and to manage the risk of increasing fuel prices. Our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors, including our assessment of market conditions for fuel, our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements, the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market, our overall appetite for risk and applicable regulatory policies. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding jet fuel derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, we purchased all of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract. The cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain amendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new CBA, or the parties have been released to self-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lockouts.\nWe have four union-represented employee groups comprising approximately 73% of our employees at December 31, 2015. Our pilots are represented by the Airline Pilots Association, International, or ALPA, our flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, or AFA-CWA, our flight dispatchers are represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU, and our ramp service agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW. Conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages. In June 2010, we experienced a five-day strike by our pilots, which caused us to shut down our flight operations. The strike ended as a result of our reaching a tentative agreement under a Return to Work Agreement and a full flight schedule was resumed on June 18, 2010. On August 1, 2010, we entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement with our pilots. In August 2015, our CBA with our pilots became amendable and we are currently in discussions with ALPA regarding a new contract. In August 2013, we entered into a five-year agreement with our flight dispatchers. In August 2014, with the help of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. The tentative agreement was subject to ratification by the flight attendant membership. On October 1, 2014, we were notified that the flight attendants voted to not ratify the tentative agreement. We will continue to work together with the AFA-CWA and the NMB with a goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. On July 8, 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, including material economic terms, and we are in the process of negotiating a final collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW. We believe the five-year term of our CBAs is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs and provide us with competitive labor costs compared to other U.S.-based low-cost carriers. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their CBAs, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, such as the strike by our pilots in June 2010. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Any agreement we do reach could increase our labor and related expenses.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed into law. While much of the cost of the healthcare legislation enacted will occur after 2015 due to provisions of the legislation being delayed and phased in over time, we expect changes to our healthcare cost structure could potentially increase our operating costs, with healthcare costs increasing at a higher rate than our employee headcount.\nMaintenance Expense. Maintenance expense grew through 2015, 2014 and 2013 mainly as a result of a growing fleet and the gradual increase of required maintenance for the older aircraft in our fleet. As the fleet ages, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms. The amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates, average stage length, the interval between heavy maintenance events, the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time. However, we believe, based on our scheduled maintenance events, maintenance expense and maintenance-related amortization expense in 2016 will be approximately $164 million. In addition, we expect to capitalize $92 million of costs for heavy maintenance during 2016.\nAs a result of a significant portion of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time, heavy maintenance scheduled on each of our planes will occur at roughly the same time, meaning we will incur our most expensive\nscheduled maintenance obligations across our current fleet around the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service. When accounting for maintenance expense under the deferral method, heavy maintenance is amortized over the shorter of either the remaining lease term or the next estimated heavy maintenance event. As a result, deferred maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will generally have shorter amortization periods than those occurring earlier in the lease term. This will create higher depreciation and amortization expense specific to any aircraft related to heavy maintenance during the final years of the lease as compared to earlier periods. Please see - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Aircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization.\u201d\nMaintenance Reserve Obligations. The terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to post deposits for future maintenance, also known as maintenance reserves, to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our balance sheet. As a result, the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Aircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization\u201d and -Maintenance Reserves.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, please see Notes to Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenues from tickets sold are initially deferred as ATL. Passenger revenues are recognized when transportation is provided. An unused non-refundable ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue for the expired ticket value at the date of scheduled travel.\nOur most significant non-ticket revenues include revenues generated from air travel-related services paid for baggage, passenger usage fees, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, and loyalty programs. The majority of our non-ticket revenues are recognized once the related flight departs. Some of our non-ticket revenues, such as those related to itinerary changes, are recognized at the time products are purchased or services are provided. These revenues also include commissions from the sales of hotel rooms, trip insurance and rental cars recognized at the time the service is rendered. Non-ticket revenues also include revenues from our subscription-based $9 Fare Club, recognized on a straight-line basis over 12 months.\nCustomers may elect to change their itinerary prior to the date of departure. A service charge is assessed and recognized on the date the change is initiated and is deducted from the face value of the original purchase price of the ticket, and the original ticket becomes invalid. The amount remaining after deducting the service charge is called a credit shell which expires 60 days from the date the credit shell is created and can be used towards the purchase of a new ticket and our other service offerings. The amount of credits expected to expire unused is recognized as revenue upon issuance of the credit and is estimated based on historical experience. Estimating the amount of credits that will go unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment.\nFrequent Flier Program. We accrue for mileage credits earned through travel, including mileage credits for members with an insufficient number of mileage credits to earn an award, under our FREE SPIRIT program based on the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for credits that are expected to be redeemed. Incremental costs include fuel, insurance, security, ticketing and facility charges reduced by an estimate of amounts required to be", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report.\n2015 Year in Review\nThe year 2015 marks our ninth consecutive year of profitability. In 2015, we increased our capacity by 30.0%, as we grew our fleet of Airbus single-aisle aircraft from 65 to 79 aircraft, launched service to 40 new markets and added 1 new destination: Cleveland, Ohio.\nDuring 2015, we earned net income of $317.2 million ($4.38 per share, diluted), compared to net income of $225.5 million ($3.08 per share, diluted) in 2014. The increase in earnings was a result of our increased capacity as well as lower fuel and non-fuel unit costs, which allowed us to continue generating high profit margins.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we achieved an operating profit margin of 23.8%, the highest in our history, on $2,141.5 million in operating revenues. Our traffic grew by 27.1% as we continued to address an underserved market with ultra-low fares. Increased competitive pressures from major domestic network carriers aggressively discounting fares led to a 12.8% decrease in passenger yields year over year. As a result of this pricing environment, TRASM in 2015 was 10.08 cents, a decrease of 14.7% compared to the prior year period. Total revenue per passenger flight segment decreased 11.6%, year over year, from $135.14 to $119.49 driven by a decrease of 18.5% in ticket revenue per passenger flight segment.\nOur total non-ticket revenue increased by 23.6%, or $185.5 million, to $972.1 million in 2015. Despite the increased competitive pressures during 2015, our average non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment remained relatively stable with a decline of only 1.4%, to $54.24. Our unbundling model provides a more stable revenue stream as demonstrated during periods of lower passenger ticket yields.\nOur operating cost structure is a primary area of focus and is at the core of our ULCC business model in which we compete solely on the basis of price. Our unit operating costs continue to be among the lowest of any airline in the United States. During 2015, our adjusted CASM ex-fuel decreased by 6.5% to 5.50 cents. The decrease on a per unit basis was primarily due to a decrease in aircraft rent and in salaries, wages and benefits. The decrease in aircraft rent per ASM was driven by a change in the mix of leased and purchased aircraft. Labor expense per ASM in 2015 was lower, as compared to prior year, due to scale benefits from overall growth and the introduction of larger gauge aircraft. These decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the depreciation of purchased aircraft.\nDuring 2015, we took delivery of 14 new aircraft, of which 11 are financed through senior and junior long-term debt and 3 are financed through an EETC. This EETC was our first aircraft-backed bond publicly offered by the Company. As of December 31, 2015, our 79 Airbus A320-family aircraft fleet was comprised of 29 A319s, 42 A320s and 8 A321s, of which 18 are owned and 61 are financed under operating leases. As of December 31, 2015, our aircraft orders consisted of 87 A320 family aircraft with Airbus and an additional 5 direct operating leases for A320neos with a third party, scheduled for delivery from 2016 through 2021.\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are comprised of passenger revenues and non-ticket revenues.\nPassenger Revenues. Passenger revenues consist of the base fares that customers pay for air travel.\nNon-ticket Revenues. Non-ticket revenues are generated from air travel-related charges for baggage, passenger usage fee (PUF) for bookings through certain of our distribution channels, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, hotel and rental car travel packages and loyalty programs such as our FREE SPIRIT affinity credit card program and $9 Fare Club. Non-ticket revenues also include revenues derived from the sale of advertising to third parties on our website and on board our aircraft.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars. Passenger revenues, as well as most non-ticket revenues, are recognized once the related flight departs. Accordingly, the value of tickets and portions of non-ticket revenues sold in advance of travel is included under our current liabilities as air traffic liability,\u201d or ATL, until the related air travel is provided. Some of our non-ticket revenues are recognized at the time the ancillary products are purchased or ancillary services are provided, such as revenues from our subscription-based $9 Fare Club, which we recognize on a straight-line basis over 12\nmonths. Revenue generated from the FREE SPIRIT credit card affinity program are recognized in accordance with the criteria as set forth in Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2009-13. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Frequent Flier Program.\u201d\nWe recognize revenues net of certain taxes and airport passenger fees, which are collected by us on behalf of airports and governmental agencies and remitted to the applicable governmental entity or airport on a periodic basis. These taxes and fees include U.S. federal transportation taxes, federal security charges, airport passenger facility charges and foreign arrival and departure taxes. These items are collected from customers at the time they purchase their tickets, but are not included in our revenues. We record a liability upon collection from the customer and relieve the liability when payments are remitted to the applicable governmental agency or airport.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of the following line items.\nAircraft Fuel. Aircraft fuel expense is our single largest operating expense. It includes the cost of jet fuel, related federal taxes, fueling into-plane fees and transportation fees. It also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses arising from any activity on our fuel derivatives. Our fuel derivatives generally consist of United States Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps (jet fuel swaps) and United States Gulf Coast jet fuel options (jet fuel options).\nSalaries, Wages and Benefits. Salaries, wages and benefits expense includes the salaries, hourly wages, bonuses and equity compensation paid to employees for their services, as well as the related expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes.\nAircraft Rent. Aircraft rent expense consists of monthly lease rents for aircraft and spare engines under the terms of the related operating leases and is recognized on a straight-line basis. Aircraft rent expense also includes supplemental rent. Supplemental rent is made up of maintenance reserves paid or expected to be paid to aircraft lessors in advance of the performance of major maintenance activities that are not probable of being reimbursed and lease return condition obligations which we begin to accrue when they are probable. Aircraft rent expense is net of the amortization of gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions on our flight equipment. As of December 31, 2015, 61 of our 79 aircraft and all of our 11 spare engines are financed under operating leases.\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. Landing fees and other rents include both fixed and variable facilities expenses, such as the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities, overfly fees paid to other countries and the monthly rent paid for our headquarters facility.\nDistribution. Distribution expense includes all of our direct costs including the cost of web support, our third-party call center, travel agent commissions and related GDS fees and credit card transaction fees, associated with the sale of our tickets and other products and services.\nMaintenance, Materials and Repairs. Maintenance, materials and repairs expense includes parts, materials, repairs and fees for repairs performed by third-party vendors directly required to maintain our fleet. It excludes direct labor cost related to our own mechanics, which is included under salaries, wages and benefits. It also excludes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses, which we defer under the deferral method of accounting and amortize as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of fixed assets we own and leasehold improvements. It also includes the amortization of heavy maintenance expenses we defer under the deferral method of accounting for heavy maintenance events and recognize into expense on a straight-line or usage basis until the earlier of the next estimated heavy maintenance event or the remaining lease term.\nLoss on Disposal of Assets. Loss on disposal of assets includes the net losses on the disposal of our fixed assets.\nOther Operating Expenses. Other operating expenses include airport operations expense and fees charged by third-party vendors for ground handling services and food and liquor supply service expenses, passenger re-accommodation expense, the cost of passenger liability and aircraft hull insurance, all other insurance policies except for employee related insurance, travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel, professional fees, personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses. No individual item included in this category represented more than 5% of our total operating expenses.\nSpecial Charges. Special charges include termination costs and secondary offering costs.\nOther Expense (Income)\nInterest Expense. Interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to the financing of purchased aircraft. For 2014, interest expense primarily represented interest related to the financing of purchased aircraft, interest related to the underpayment of prior year jet fuel FET and interest charged under the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA). Interest expense in 2013 primarily related to interest on the TRA. For a detailed discussion of the TRA, see Notes to the Financial Statements-17. Tax Receivable Agreement.\u201d\nCapitalized Interest. Capitalized interest represents interest cost incurred during the acquisition period of an aircraft which theoretically could have been avoided had we not made PDPs for that aircraft. The percent of interest expense capitalized is equal to the amount of interest which could have been avoided. As such, if the amount of PDPs on deposit is less than the amount of related debt on which interest is incurred, then only a percent of total incurred interest expense qualifies for capitalization. These amounts are capitalized as part of the cost of the aircraft upon delivery. Capitalization of interest ceases when the asset is ready for service. Capitalized interest for 2015 primarily related to the interest incurred on long-term debt. For 2014, capitalized interest related to interest incurred on long-term debt, underpayment of prior year jet fuel FET and interest charged under the TRA. For 2013, capitalized interest related to interest incurred in connection with payments owed under the TRA.\nInterest Income. For 2015, interest income was related to interest earned on funds required to be held in escrow in accordance with the terms of our EETC. For a detailed discussion of the EETC, see Notes to the Financial Statements-9. Debt and Other Obligations.\u201d\nOther Expense. For 2014, other expense included $1.4 million related to the tax receivable settlement amount in excess of the amount previously accrued for. In addition, for 2014, other expense included a charitable contribution of $1.0 million that is specifically creditable against current income tax in the State of Florida, as allowed under state law.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the liability method. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred taxes are recorded based on differences between the financial statement basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities and available tax loss and credit carryforwards. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In evaluating the ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, in determining future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.\nIn connection with our IPO in 2011, we entered into the TRA and thereby distributed immediately prior to the completion of the IPO to the holders of common stock as of such time, or the Pre-IPO Stockholders, the right to receive an amount equal to 90% of the cash savings in federal income tax realized by it by virtue of the use of the federal net operating loss, deferred interest deductions and alternative minimum tax credits held by us as of March 31, 2011, which was defined as the Pre-IPO NOL. Cash tax savings were generally computed by comparing actual federal income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such Pre-IPO NOLs (as defined in the TRA) not been available. Upon consummation of the IPO and execution of the TRA, we recorded a liability with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital. The amount and timing of payments under the TRA depended upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of taxable income generated in future periods and any limitations that may have been imposed on our ability to use the Pre-IPO NOLs. The term of the TRA was to continue until the first to occur (a) the full payment of all amounts required under the agreement with respect to utilization or expiration of all of the Pre-IPO NOLs, (b) the end of the taxable year including the tenth anniversary of the IPO or (c) a change in control of the Company.\nIn accordance with the TRA, we were required to submit a Tax Benefit Schedule showing the proposed TRA payout amount to the Stockholder Representatives within 45 calendar days of filing our tax return. Stockholder Representatives were defined as Indigo Pacific Partners, LLC and OCM FIE, LLC, representing the two largest ownership interest of pre-IPO shares. The Tax Benefit Schedule was to become final and binding on all parties unless a Stockholder Representative, within 45 calendar days after receiving such schedule, provided us with notice of a material objection to such schedule. If the parties, for any reason, were unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in any notice within 30 calendar days of receipt of such notice, we and the Stockholder Representatives had the right to employ the reconciliation procedures as set forth in the TRA. If the Tax Benefit Schedule was accepted, we then had five days after acceptance to make payments to the Pre-IPO stockholders. Pursuant to the TRA's reconciliation procedures, any disputes that could not be settled amicably, were to be settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator jointly selected by both parties.\nDuring the second quarter of 2012, we paid $27.2 million, or 90% of the 2011 tax savings realized from the utilization of NOLs, including $0.3 million of applicable interest, to the Pre-IPO Stockholders.\nDuring 2013, we filed an amended 2009 income tax return which resulted in a reduction to the estimated TRA liability from $8.0 million to $5.6 million. On September 13, 2013, we filed our 2012 federal income tax return, and on October 14, 2013, we submitted a Tax Benefit Schedule to the Stockholder Representatives. On November 27, 2013, pursuant to the TRA, we received an objection notice to the Tax Benefit Schedule from the Stockholder Representatives. On April 7, 2014, we received a demand for arbitration from the Stockholder Representatives. Prior to commencing arbitration proceedings, on June 17, 2014, we and Stockholder Representatives agreed on a settlement amount of $7.0 million in addition to interest of $0.3 million. The agreed upon settlement was in excess of the outstanding liability of $5.6 million at the time of settlement. The excess payment of $1.4 million was recorded within other expense in the statement of operations and recorded as cash from operations in the statement of cash flows. We have made all payments in accordance with the agreed upon settlement terms and have no outstanding obligations related to the TRA.\nTrends and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business\nWe believe our operating and business performance is driven by various factors affecting airlines and their markets, trends affecting the broader travel industry and trends affecting the specific markets and customer base that we target. The following key factors may affect our future performance.\nCompetition. The airline industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the airline industry are fare pricing, total price, flight schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a city, customer service, safety record, reputation, code-sharing relationships, frequent flier programs and redemption opportunities. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, target promotions and frequent flier initiatives. Airlines typically use discount fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slower travel periods to generate cash flow and to maximize unit revenue. The prevalence of discount fares can be particularly acute when a competitor has excess capacity that it is under financial pressure to sell.\nIn 2015, the airline industry saw greater and more persistent price discounting than in the preceding several years. A major reason enabling price discounting was the sharp decline in petroleum prices on world markets during the last couple years, which increased airline profitability and more than offset general increases in non-fuel costs. In addition, significant airline capacity increases in certain major cities - such as Dallas and Chicago - exerted strong downward price pressure in those markets. Finally, beginning in mid-2015 network carriers began seeking to match low-cost carrier and ULCC pricing on portions of their marginal unsold capacity, particularly in their key hub markets.\nAbsent significant increases in fuel prices and more constrained capacity, we expect the discounting trend to continue for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the network carriers have developed, or are in process of developing, a fare-class pricing approach, in which a portion of available seats may be sold at or near ULCC prices, but without most product features available to their passengers paying at higher fare levels on the same flight. Broad fare discounting can have the effect of diluting the profitability of revenues of network carriers, which have units costs significantly above those of ULCCs, but the fare-class approach may allow network carriers to continue offering a competitive price to ULCCs on some flights or routes, while maintaining higher pricing to their traditional constituencies of business and more affluent travelers.\nSeasonality and Volatility. Our results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of those for the entire year because the air transportation business is subject to significant seasonal fluctuations. We generally expect demand to be greater in the second and third quarters compared to the rest of the year. The air transportation business is also volatile and highly affected by economic cycles and trends. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending, fear of terrorism or war, weakening economic conditions, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, changes in governmental regulations on taxes and fees, weather and other factors have resulted in significant fluctuations in revenues and results of operations in the past. We believe demand for business travel historically has been more sensitive to economic pressures than demand for low-price travel. Finally, a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in markets such as South Florida, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Northeast and northern Midwest regions of the United States, which are particularly vulnerable to weather, airport traffic constraints and other delays.\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel costs represent the single largest operating expense for most airlines, including ours. Fuel costs have been subject to wide price fluctuations in recent years. Fuel availability and pricing are also subject to refining capacity, periods of market surplus and shortage and demand for heating oil, gasoline and other petroleum products, as well as meteorological, economic and political factors and events occurring throughout the world, which we can neither control nor accurately predict. We source a significant portion of our fuel from refining resources located in the southeast United States, particularly facilities\nadjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf Coast fuel is subject to volatility and supply disruptions, particularly in hurricane season when refinery shutdowns have occurred, or when the threat of weather-related disruptions has caused Gulf Coast fuel prices to spike above other regional sources. Our derivatives, from time to time, generally may consist of United States Gulf Coast jet fuel swaps (jet fuel swaps) and United States Gulf Coast jet fuel options (jet fuel options). Both jet fuel swaps and jet fuel options can be used at times to protect the refining price risk between the price of crude oil and the price of refined jet fuel, and to manage the risk of increasing fuel prices. Our fuel hedging practices are dependent upon many factors, including our assessment of market conditions for fuel, our access to the capital necessary to support margin requirements, the pricing of hedges and other derivative products in the market, our overall appetite for risk and applicable regulatory policies. As of December 31, 2015, we had no outstanding jet fuel derivatives. As of December 31, 2015, we purchased all of our aircraft fuel under a single fuel service contract. The cost and future availability of jet fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.\nLabor. The airline industry is heavily unionized. The wages, benefits and work rules of unionized airline industry employees are determined by collective bargaining agreements, or CBAs. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain amendable dates\u201d rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new CBA, or the parties have been released to self-help\u201d by the NMB. In most circumstances, the RLA prohibits strikes; however, after release by the NMB, carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures such as strikes and lockouts.\nWe have four union-represented employee groups comprising approximately 73% of our employees at December 31, 2015. Our pilots are represented by the Airline Pilots Association, International, or ALPA, our flight attendants are represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, or AFA-CWA, our flight dispatchers are represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, or TWU, and our ramp service agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, or IAMAW. Conflicts between airlines and their unions can lead to work slowdowns or stoppages. In June 2010, we experienced a five-day strike by our pilots, which caused us to shut down our flight operations. The strike ended as a result of our reaching a tentative agreement under a Return to Work Agreement and a full flight schedule was resumed on June 18, 2010. On August 1, 2010, we entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement with our pilots. In August 2015, our CBA with our pilots became amendable and we are currently in discussions with ALPA regarding a new contract. In August 2013, we entered into a five-year agreement with our flight dispatchers. In August 2014, with the help of the NMB, we reached a tentative agreement for a five-year contract with our flight attendants. The tentative agreement was subject to ratification by the flight attendant membership. On October 1, 2014, we were notified that the flight attendants voted to not ratify the tentative agreement. We will continue to work together with the AFA-CWA and the NMB with a goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. On July 8, 2014, certain ramp service agents directly employed by us voted to be represented by the IAMAW. In May 2015, we entered into a five-year interim collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW, including material economic terms, and we are in the process of negotiating a final collective bargaining agreement with the IAMAW. We believe the five-year term of our CBAs is valuable in providing stability to our labor costs and provide us with competitive labor costs compared to other U.S.-based low-cost carriers. If we are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their CBAs, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, such as the strike by our pilots in June 2010. A strike or other significant labor dispute with our unionized employees is likely to adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Any agreement we do reach could increase our labor and related expenses.\nIn 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was passed into law. While much of the cost of the healthcare legislation enacted will occur after 2015 due to provisions of the legislation being delayed and phased in over time, we expect changes to our healthcare cost structure could potentially increase our operating costs, with healthcare costs increasing at a higher rate than our employee headcount.\nMaintenance Expense. Maintenance expense grew through 2015, 2014 and 2013 mainly as a result of a growing fleet and the gradual increase of required maintenance for the older aircraft in our fleet. As the fleet ages, we expect that maintenance costs will increase in absolute terms. The amount of total maintenance costs and related amortization of heavy maintenance (included in depreciation and amortization expense) is subject to many variables such as future utilization rates, average stage length, the interval between heavy maintenance events, the size and makeup of the fleet in future periods and the level of unscheduled maintenance events and their actual costs. Accordingly, we cannot reliably quantify future maintenance expenses for any significant period of time. However, we believe, based on our scheduled maintenance events, maintenance expense and maintenance-related amortization expense in 2016 will be approximately $164 million. In addition, we expect to capitalize $92 million of costs for heavy maintenance during 2016.\nAs a result of a significant portion of our fleet being acquired over a relatively short period of time, heavy maintenance scheduled on each of our planes will occur at roughly the same time, meaning we will incur our most expensive\nscheduled maintenance obligations across our current fleet around the same time. These more significant maintenance activities will result in out-of-service periods during which our aircraft will be dedicated to maintenance activities and unavailable to fly revenue service. When accounting for maintenance expense under the deferral method, heavy maintenance is amortized over the shorter of either the remaining lease term or the next estimated heavy maintenance event. As a result, deferred maintenance events occurring closer to the end of the lease term will generally have shorter amortization periods than those occurring earlier in the lease term. This will create higher depreciation and amortization expense specific to any aircraft related to heavy maintenance during the final years of the lease as compared to earlier periods. Please see - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Aircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization.\u201d\nMaintenance Reserve Obligations. The terms of some of our aircraft lease agreements require us to post deposits for future maintenance, also known as maintenance reserves, to the lessor in advance of and as collateral for the performance of major maintenance events, resulting in our recording significant prepaid deposits on our balance sheet. As a result, the cash costs of scheduled major maintenance events are paid in advance of the recognition of the maintenance event in our results of operations. Please see -Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Aircraft Maintenance, Materials, Repair Costs and Related Heavy Maintenance Amortization\u201d and -Maintenance Reserves.\u201d\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. For a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies, please see Notes to Financial Statements-1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those policies that reflect significant judgments or estimates about matters both inherently uncertain and material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenues from tickets sold are initially deferred as ATL. Passenger revenues are recognized when transportation is provided. An unused non-refundable ticket expires at the date of scheduled travel and is recognized as revenue for the expired ticket value at the date of scheduled travel.\nOur most significant non-ticket revenues include revenues generated from air travel-related services paid for baggage, passenger usage fees, advance seat selection, itinerary changes, and loyalty programs. The majority of our non-ticket revenues are recognized once the related flight departs. Some of our non-ticket revenues, such as those related to itinerary changes, are recognized at the time products are purchased or services are provided. These revenues also include commissions from the sales of hotel rooms, trip insurance and rental cars recognized at the time the service is rendered. Non-ticket revenues also include revenues from our subscription-based $9 Fare Club, recognized on a straight-line basis over 12 months.\nCustomers may elect to change their itinerary prior to the date of departure. A service charge is assessed and recognized on the date the change is initiated and is deducted from the face value of the original purchase price of the ticket, and the original ticket becomes invalid. The amount remaining after deducting the service charge is called a credit shell which expires 60 days from the date the credit shell is created and can be used towards the purchase of a new ticket and our other service offerings. The amount of credits expected to expire unused is recognized as revenue upon issuance of the credit and is estimated based on historical experience. Estimating the amount of credits that will go unused involves some level of subjectivity and judgment.\nFrequent Flier Program. We accrue for mileage credits earned through travel, including mileage credits for members with an insufficient number of mileage credits to earn an award, under our FREE SPIRIT program based on the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for credits that are expected to be redeemed. Incremental costs include fuel, insurance, security, ticketing and facility charges reduced by an estimate of amounts required to be"}
