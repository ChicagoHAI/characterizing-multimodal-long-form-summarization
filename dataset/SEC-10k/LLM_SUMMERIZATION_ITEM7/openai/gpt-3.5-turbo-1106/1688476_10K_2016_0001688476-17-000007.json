Our primary service offerings include horizontal and vertical fracturing, wireline perforation and logging and engineered solutions, as well as other value-added service offerings. With approximately 944,250 hydraulic horsepower spread across 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets and 23 wireline trucks located in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Bakken Formation and other active oil and gas basins, we provide industry-leading completion services with a strict focus on health, safety and environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. Our company prides itself on our outstanding employee culture, our efficiency and our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and communities in which we operate.\nWe provide our services in conjunction with onshore well development, in addition to stimulation operations on existing wells, to well-capitalized E&P customers, with some of the highest quality and safety standards in the industry and long-term development programs that enable us to maximize operational efficiencies and the return on our assets. We believe our integrated approach and proven capabilities enable us to deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments, higher pressure rates and proppant intensity, and multiple fracturing stages in challenging high-pressure formations. In addition, our technical team and engineering center, which is located in The Woodlands, Texas,\nprovides us the ability to supplement our service offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address customers' completion requirements and challenges.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets and eight wireline trucks operating in the most active unconventional oil and natural gas basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation and the Bakken Formation. We are one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale and the Bakken Formation by total hydraulic horsepower deployed.\nWe believe the demand for our services will increase over the medium and long-term as a result of a number of favorable industry trends. While drilling and completion activity has improved along with a rebound in commodity prices from their lows in early 2016 of $26.19 per barrel (based on the WTI spot price) and $1.49 per mmBtu for natural gas, we believe there are long-term fundamental demand and supply trends that will benefit our company. We believe demand for our services will grow from:\n\u2022 increases in customer drilling budgets focused in our core service areas;\n\u2022 increases in the percentage of rigs that are drilling horizontal wells;\n\u2022 increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;\n\u2022 increases in the number of fracture stages in a typical horizontal wellbore; and\n\u2022 increases in pad drilling and simultaneous fracturing/wireline operations.\nWe believe demand and pricing for our services will be further enhanced by a reduction in available hydraulic fracturing equipment as a result of:\n\u2022 cannibalization of parked equipment and increased maintenance costs;\n\u2022 aging of existing fleets given the limited investment since the industry downturn in late 2014;\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>increased customer focus on well-capitalized, safe and efficient service providers that can meet or exceed their requirements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table> \u2022 reduced access to capital for fleet acquisition, maintenance and deployment.\nHow We Generate Our Revenues and Evaluate Our Business\nWe are organized into two reportable segments, consisting of Completion Services, including our hydraulic fracturing and wireline divisions; and Other Services, including our coiled tubing, cementing and drilling divisions. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our customer base, the complementary nature of our services, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on equipment utilization, revenue, segment gross profit and gross margin. We monitor our cost of services using such metrics as cost of operations per stage for divisions in our Completion Services segment and cost of operations per working day for divisions in our Other Services segment.\nSegment gross profit is a key metric that we use to evaluate segment operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. We define segment gross profit as segment revenues less segment direct and indirect cost of services. Cost of services include direct and indirect labor costs, proppant and freight, maintenance of equipment, chemicals, fuel and transportation freight costs, contract services, crew costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Gross margin is calculated by dividing segment gross profit by segment revenue.\nThe Costs of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal expenses involved in conducting our completion services are materials and freight, labor costs, the costs of maintaining our equipment and fuel costs.\nOur direct labor costs vary with the amount of equipment deployed and the utilization of that equipment. Approximately 81% of our field service employees are paid on an hourly basis. Another key component of labor\ncosts relates to the ongoing training of our field service employees, which improves safety rates and reduces attrition.\nApproximately 97% of our direct cost of services is associated with the Completion Services segment, with a majority of those costs relating to our hydraulic fracturing division. We incur significant costs relating to the proppant, chemicals, guar and fuel used in our hydraulic fracturing operations. These costs fluctuate with usage increases in proportion to increases in the number, size and utilization of our fleets, as well as the prices for each material, including delivery costs.\nFiscal 2016 Highlights\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Ranked as one of the top three providers in major growth basins, the Permian, Marcellus / Utica, SCOOP/STACK and Bakken based on deployed hydraulic horsepower\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Completed the integration of Trican's U.S. oilfield service operations seamlessly and expanded our hydraulic fracturing capacity to 23 fleets at December 31, 2016, and achieved cost savings of approximately $80 million\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Received Shell's Global Well Services Performance Award, recognizing exceptional performance and customer service in hydraulic fracturing and wireline services\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Continued strong hiring, retention and training track record\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Decreased our TRIR and LTIR by approximately 56% and 50%, respectively, from 2015 to 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Outlook\nAs described above, we believe the demand for our services will increase over the medium and long-term as a result of a number of favorable industry trends, including projected increases in demand for oil and natural gas liquids products, projected increases in drilling activity, and projected increases in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in the United States. We are encouraged by the increase in well completion activity we are seeing across our diversified footprint. We also believe that several differentiating attributes will enable our future success, including our high-quality, fit-for-purpose and well maintained equipment, our financial strength and discipline, the scale and flexibility of our supply chain, our ability to offer customized completions solutions and our speed-to-market advantage.\nHaving deployed two additional fleets in January 2017 and another one in March 2017, we currently have 16 hydraulic fracturing fleets deployed, representing approximately 70% utilization on our 23 total fleets. We were able to see continued improvement in our pricing for new dedicated capacity agreements, which reflected increased leading-edge pricing of approximately 25% sequentially on a gross basis. These factors and general improvement in market conditions lead us to expect sequential revenue increases of between 30% and 40% in the first quarter of 2017. Offsetting the revenue increases is the recent inflation in input costs, including sand. This inflation will serve as a partial headwind to our profitability, given the lag effect of pricing re-openers on our pressure pumping agreements. However, our agreements with our customers allow us to adjust pricing every three to six months to recover inflation and align contract pricing to market terms. As a result, the inflation in input costs may cause short term margin compression. In addition, we continue to leverage our scale in the market to drive efficiencies on our supply chain and logistics network with increased volume and activity.\nOverall, we believe that favorable trends in pricing, our established business model and the operating efficiency we benefit from with our current customers will enable us to generate attractive cash flow from incremental hydraulic fracturing fleet deployment in 2017. As a result, we are prepared to responsibly accelerate the re-activation of our remaining horsepower subject to the availability of our resources and/or the hiring and proper training of our crews.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for 2016 compared to 2015. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the financial and operating results of Keane and the Acquired Trican Operations for the period from March 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016.

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from Completion Services and Other Services. Revenue in 2016 increased by $54.4 million or 15%, to $420.6 million from $366.2 million in 2015. The increase in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue increased by $47.0 million, or 13%, to $410.9 million in 2016 from $363.8 million in 2015. This change was primarily attributable to a 100% growth in the number of deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets, as a result of increased utilization of our combined asset base following our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations. This increase was offset by a 43% decrease in the revenue per deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet as a result of competitive pricing driven by current market conditions.\nOther Services: Other Services segment revenue increased by $7.4 million, or 316%, to $9.7 million in 2016 from $2.3 million in 2015. The change was primarily attributable to revenues from the coiled tubing and cementing divisions acquired in connection with the Acquired Trican Operations, which contributed $9.7 million of revenue to\nthis segment in 2016. This increase was offset by a $2.3 million reduction in revenues from the drilling division, which was idled in May 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in rig count.\nCosts of services. Costs of services in 2016 increased by $109.7 million, or 36%, when compared to 2015. This increase was driven by higher activity in the Completion Services segment, increased costs in connection with a prolonged completion timeline driven by customer completion delays and increased maintenance costs associated with higher-pressure jobs. In addition, in 2016, we had one-time costs of $23.6 million consisting of acquisition and integration costs of approximately $13.6 million associated with the Acquired Trican Operations and commissioning costs of approximately $10.0 million, including labor and maintenance, to deploy idle hydraulic fracturing fleets and coiled tubing units acquired from Trican. These increases were partially offset by our cost saving initiatives as described below. Costs of services as a percentage of total revenue for in 2016 was 99%, which represented an increase of 15% from 2015. Excluding one-time costs of $23.6 million (described above) and $1.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, total costs of services was $392.7 million and $305.2 million in 2016 and 2015, or 93% and 83% of revenue, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 10%. Costs of services, as a percentage of total revenue is presented below:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment cost of services as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of services as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in cost of services by reportable segment is further discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment cost of services increased by $96.9 million or 32%, to $401.9 million in 2016 from $305.0 million in 2015. As a percentage of segment revenue, total cost of services was 98% and 84%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 14%. The increase in segment cost of services was driven by higher activity coupled with longer lateral segments and increased proppant volume and increased maintenance costs associated with higher-pressure jobs. In addition, in 2016, we had one-time costs of $22.5 million consisting of acquisition and integration costs of approximately $13.2 million associated with the Acquired Trican Operations and commissioning costs of approximately $9.3 million, including labor and maintenance, to deploy idle hydraulic fracturing fleets acquired from Trican. These increases were partially offset by cost saving initiatives to drive down supply and material costs through negotiated price concessions from vendors, management of labor costs and our fixed cost structure through facility consolidation and other cost saving initiatives related to shipping and equipment costs. Excluding one-time costs of $22.5 million and $0.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, Completion Services segment costs of services was $379.4 million and $304.2 million in 2016 and 2015, or 92% and 84% of segment revenue, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 8%.\nOther Services: Other Services segment cost of services increased by $12.9 million to $14.5 million, or 826% in 2016 from $1.6 million in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to cost of services in connection with the deployment of, and increased headcount related to, our coiled tubing and cementing operations acquired from Trican, which included one-time integration and commissioning costs of $1.1 million. This increase was partially offset by the $0.6 million decrease of cost of services related to the idling of our drilling services in May 2015. We idled our cementing services and coiled tubing division in April 2016 and December 2016, respectively. All associated overhead has been re-allocated to the Completion Services segment or eliminated. Excluding one-time costs of $1.1 million in 2016 described above, and $0.5 million in 2015, Other Services segment costs of services was $13.3 million and $1.1 million in 2016 and 2015, or 137% and 46% of segment revenue, respectively, which is an increase as a percentage of segment revenue of 91%. This increase was a result of unfavorable absorption of fixed costs on low revenue as coiled tubing was a new division acquired as part of the Acquired Trican Operations.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $31.4 million, or 45%, to $101.0 million in 2016 from $69.5 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to additional\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $42.1 million related to the property and equipment included in the Acquired Trican Operations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of Keane's existing equipment due to some assets becoming fully depreciated and reduced capital expenditures in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $27.0 million, or 104%, to $52.8 million in 2016 from $25.8 million in 2015. The increase in SG&A expense is related to increased headcount, property taxes and insurance associated with a larger asset base as a result of the Acquired Trican Operations. SG&A as a percentage of total revenue was 13% in 2016 compared with 7% in 2015. Total one-time charges, excluding unit-based compensation, were $23.4 million in 2016 and $3.5 million in 2015, which were primarily related to the acquisition and integration of the Acquired Trican Operations and professional fees incurred in connection with the IPO. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of our Canadian subsidiary due to $2.5 million of wind-down costs incurred during 2015, which were no longer recurring during 2016. Excluding one-time costs of $23.4 million and $3.5 million described above, SG&A expense was $29.4 million and $22.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represents an increase of 31% primarily driven by the acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations.\nImpairment. In 2016, we recognized impairment expense of $0.2 million as a result of our non-compete agreement relating to the drilling business within our Other Services segment, due to the fact that this non-compete was no longer expected to generate any future cash flows. In 2015, we recognized impairment expense of $3.9 million, which was comprised of a $2.4 million impairment on indefinite-lived intangible assets in our Completion Services segment as a result of the loss of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of Ultra Tech Frac Services, LLC (the UTFS Acquisition\u201d), a $1.2 million impairment on the trade name of our drilling business in our Other Services segment and a $0.3 million impairment on our drilling rig fleet in our Other Services segment.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net, in 2016 decreased by $2.4 million, or 162% to income of $0.9 million from expense of $1.5 million in 2015. This decrease in was primarily driven by an expense recognized in 2015 related to the forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit due to the cancellation of a hydraulic fracturing equipment purchase order, which was no longer recurring during 2016.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by $14.8 million, or 63% to $38.3 million in 2016 from $23.5 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4.9 million increase in interest expense on our Notes due to an increase in the interest rate in accordance with the modified terms of the NPA; $7.0 million interest expense incurred on the 2016 Term Loan Facility in connection with the Trican acquisition; $1.8 million of unrealized and realized losses related to an interest rate swap derivative with all changes in its fair value being recognized within other expenses starting from March 2016, which is the date when hedge accounting was discontinued; and a $3.1 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and higher commitment fees incurred on the 2016 ABL Facility. These increases were partially offset by $1.7 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the forgiveness of interest on the Related Party Loan on March 16, 2016.\nNet income (loss). Net loss was $187.1 million in 2016 as compared with net loss of $64.6 million in 2015. The increase in net loss is due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above. Upon consummation of the IPO, our successor, Keane Group, Inc., became a corporation subject to federal income taxes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from Completion Services and Other Services. Revenue in 2015 decreased by $29.7 million, or 7% to $366.2 million from $395.8 million in 2014. The decrease in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue decreased by $19.4 million, or 5% to $363.8 million in 2015 from $383.2 million in 2014. This decline was primarily attributable to a 13% decrease in the revenue per deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet as a result of pricing pressure for our services, partially offset by a 9% increase in the number of deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets.\nOther Services: Other Services segment revenue decreased by $10.3 million, or 82%, to $2.3 million in 2015 from $12.7 million in 2014. The reduction was primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues from drilling services, which were idled in May 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in rig count throughout 2015.\nCosts of Services. Costs of services in 2015 decreased by $17.1 million, or 5%, to $306.6 million from $323.7 million in 2014, primarily due to the decrease in revenue of $29.7 million during the same period. Costs of services as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 were 84%, which represented a slight increase of 2% from the prior year. The decrease in cost of services by reportable segment is further discussed below.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment cost of services as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of services as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment cost of services decreased by $9.7 million, or 3%, to $305.0 million in 2015 from $314.8 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily related to a decrease in Completion Services segment revenue, coupled with management's continued efforts and focus on cost saving initiatives to drive down supply and material costs through negotiated price concessions from vendors and management of labor costs. As a percentage of segment revenue, Completion Services segment costs of services was 84% and 82% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Services: Other Services segment cost of services decreased by $7.4 million, or 83%, to $1.6 million in 2015 from $8.9 million in 2014. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in cost of services for our drilling services, which were idled in May 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.3 million, or 2%, to $69.5 million in 2015 from $68.3 million in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to additional depreciation associated with new hydraulic fracturing and wireline equipment acquired during the second half of 2014 and 2015, partially offset by higher depreciation charge during 2014 due to the revision of the estimated useful lives of hydraulic fracturing assets with cumulative effect reflected in the year of change in accounting estimate.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. SG&A expense, which represents the costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $0.4 million, or 1% to $25.8 million in 2015 from $25.5 million in 2014. SG&A as a percentage of revenue increased to 7% in 2015 as compared with 6% in 2014. Changes in SG&A were primarily attributable to a $2.3 million increase in legal and professional fees related to our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations and a $0.9 million increase in the costs of the Canadian subsidiary due to its wind-down of activities in the second quarter of 2015. In addition, income tax expense related to the Canadian subsidiary's operations increased by $0.4 million in 2015 as compared with 2014. These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in payroll expense related to the U.S. operations due to lower stock based compensation and bonus expense associated with lower year over year performance.\nImpairment. In 2015, we recognized impairment expense of $3.9 million, which was comprised of a $2.4 million impairment on indefinite-lived intangible assets in our Completion Services segment as a result of the loss of certain customer relationships related to the UTFS Acquisition, a $1.2 million impairment on the trade name of our drilling services in our Other Services segment and a $0.3 million impairment on our drilling rig fleet in our Other Services segment. In 2014, we recognized impairment expense of $11.1 million, which was comprised of a $0.5 million impairment in our Completion Services segment as a result of the loss of certain customer relationships in our Canadian wireline operations, a $10.0 million impairment of definite-lived intangible assets in our Other Services segment as a result of the termination of a customer contract and a $0.6 million impairment on the trade name of our drilling division in our Other Services segment.\nOther expense, net. Other expense, net of other income, decreased by $0.9 million, or 39%, to $1.5 million in 2015 as compared with $2.4 million in 2014. This decrease was primarily attributed to a loss on debt extinguishment of $2.3 million recognized in 2014 for the extinguishment of our then existing term note with PNC Bank, N.A. and an accrual for the minimum commitment obligation on a sand transload contract of $0.3 million, partially offset by the 2015 forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit due to the cancellation of a hydraulic fracturing equipment order.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by $13.0 million, or 124%, to $23.5 million in 2015 from $10.5 million in 2014. This increase was attributable to additional interest expense due to the issuance of the Notes, which were issued in August and December 2014, amortization of the related debt\nfinancing costs and interest on the Shareholder Loan (as defined herein) and new capital leases entered into in November 2014.\nNet income (loss). Net loss was $64.6 million in 2015 as compared with net loss of $45.6 million in 2014. The increase in net loss is due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, we have met our liquidity needs principally from cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit agreements and other debt offerings. During 2015, our primary source of cash was cash flows from operating activities. During 2016, our primary sources of cash were the loans under our 2016 Term Loan Facility. In addition, in March 2016 we received an equity contribution of $200.0 million from our shareholders to partially fund our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations and for working capital. Our principal uses of cash are to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and to service our outstanding debt.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $48.9 million of cash and $40.3 million of availability under our 2016 ABL Facility, which resulted in a total liquidity position (as defined by our combined cash and availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility) of $89.2 million.\nOn January 25, 2017, we consummated an IPO of 30,774,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share, of which 15,700,000 shares were offered by us and 15,074,000 shares were offered by the selling stockholder. We received $260.3 million in net proceeds after deducting $19.4 million of underwriting discounts and commissions associated with the shares sold by us and $18.6 million of underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us associated with the shares sold by the selling stockholder, excluding approximately $4.5 million in offering expenses payable by us with respect to the shares sold by us and the selling stockholder. The net proceeds were used to (i) fully repay our existing balance of approximately $99 million under our 2016 Term Loan Facility, and, in addition, approximately $13.8 million of prepayment premium related to such repayment and (ii) repay $50.0 million of our Notes, and, in addition, approximately $0.5 million of prepayment premium related to such repayment. The remaining $97.0 million is to be used for general corporate purposes. As a result, our cash on hand increased by $97.0 million to $145.9 million, resulting in a total liquidity position of $186.2 million as of December 31, 2016 on an as adjusted basis.\nOn February 17, 2017, as part of the ABL Refinancing Transaction we entered into the New ABL Facility. The New ABL Facility replaced the 2016 ABL Facility, which agreement was terminated in connection with the effectiveness of the New ABL Facility. No early termination fees were incurred by Keane Group, Inc. in connection with such termination. After giving effect to the ABL Refinancing Transaction, we would have had $50.4 million of availability under our New ABL Facility as of December 31, 2016 on an as adjusted basis. As of February 28, 2017, we had $90.3 million of availability under our New ABL Facility.\nOn March 15, 2017, we entered into the New Term Loan Facility. The proceeds from New Term Loan Facility were used to repay all amounts outstanding under the NPA, which was terminated in connection with the effectiveness of the New Term Loan Facility. The remaining proceeds were used to pay transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to satisfy our liquidity requirements depends on our future operating performance, which is affected by prevailing economic conditions, market conditions in the E&P industry, availability and cost of raw materials, and financial and business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe believe that our existing cash position, cash generated through operations and our financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments for the next 12 months.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Thousands of Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(54,054\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(227,161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26,038\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(138,870\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided (used in) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>276,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10,518\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>137,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange rate on cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(400\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,502\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $54.1 million in 2016 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $37.5 million in 2015. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to competitive pricing pressure as a result of market conditions, which resulted in a decrease in operating results in 2016, as described in the Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\u201d In addition, the decrease in operating cash flows was also driven by acquisition, integration and commissioning costs of approximately $47.3 million associated primarily with the Acquired Trican Operations incurred during 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $37.5 million in 2015, compared to $18.7 million in 2014. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily attributable to positive operating results generated by our Completion Services segment, as well as cash generated by working capital changes.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $227.2 million in 2016 and $26.0 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to the cash payment of $203.9 million to Trican as part of our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations during 2016.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $26.0 million in 2015 and $138.9 million in 2014. This change is primarily attributable to significant purchases of hydraulic fracturing equipment during 2014, resulting in a net decrease in year over year purchases of equipment by $104.4 million and net decreases in advances of deposit on equipment by $9.8 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $276.6 million in 2016 as compared with net cash used in financing activities of $10.5 million in December 31, 2015. Net cash flow provided by financing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to a capital contribution from shareholders of $200 million and the gross proceeds from our 2016 Term Loan Facility of $100 million. The capital contribution and the gross proceeds from the 2016 Term Loan Facility were used to fund the acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations and working capital. These inflows were partially offset by cash paid for debt issuance costs of $15.1 million. Net cash flow used in financing activities in 2015 was primarily due to an amortization payment on the Notes and a final contingent consideration payment related to the UTFS Acquisition.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10.5 million in 2015, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $137.3 million in 2014. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2014 primarily relates to $185.9 million net proceeds from the Notes and $20.0 million from the Shareholder Loan, partially offset by extinguishment of capital leases of $48.2 million and payment of $9.5 million in connection with the UTFS Acquisition. In 2015, net cash used in financing activities was primarily related to $5.0 million of principal\npayments on the Notes and a final contingent consideration payment of $2.5 million made in February 2015 in connection with the UFTS Acquisition.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe nature of our capital expenditures is comprised of a base level of investment required to support our current operations and amounts related to growth and company initiatives. Capital expenditures for growth and company initiatives are discretionary. We currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2017 will range from $50 million to $60 million. We continuously evaluate our capital expenditures and the amount we ultimately spend will depend on a number of factors including expected industry activity levels and company initiatives (exclusive of acquisitions).\nContractual Commitments and Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that impact or could impact our liquidity.

The New ABL Facility replaced the 2016 ABL Facility, which agreement was terminated in connection with the effectiveness of the New ABL Facility. No early termination fees were incurred by Keane Group, Inc. in connection with such termination. We refer to the above as the ABL Refinancing Transaction.\u201d The following is a summary of the material provisions of the New ABL Facility. It does not include all of the provisions of the New ABL Facility, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New ABL Facility described.\nStructure. The New ABL Facility provides for a $150 million revolving credit facility (with a $20 million subfacility for letters of credit), subject to a borrowing base (as described below). In addition, subject to approval by the applicable lenders and other customary conditions, the New ABL Facility allows for an increase in commitments of up to $75 million.\nMaturity. The loans arising under the initial commitments under the New ABL Facility, that have not been extended, mature on February 17, 2022. The loans arising under any tranche of extended loans or additional commitments mature as specified in the applicable extension amendment or increase joinder, respectively.\nBorrowing Base. The amount of loans and letters of credit available under the New ABL Facility is limited to, at any time of calculation, an amount equal to (a) 85% multiplied by the amount of eligible billed accounts; plus (b) 75% multiplied by the amount of eligible unbilled accounts; provided, that the amount attributable to clause (b) may not exceed 20% of the borrowing base (after giving effect to any reserve, this limitation and the limitation set forth in the proviso in clause (c)); plus (c) the lesser of (i) 70% of the cost and (ii) 85% of the appraised value of eligible inventory and eligible frac iron; provided, that the amount attributable to clause (c) may not exceed 15% of the borrowing base (after giving effect to any reserve, this limitation and the limitation set forth in the proviso in clause (b)); minus (d) the then applicable amount of all reserves.\nInterest. Amounts outstanding under the New ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group Holdings, LLC's option, (a) the base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if total net leverage is greater than 4.0:1.0, 3.50%, (y) if the total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.0:1.0 but greater than 3.5:1.0, 3.25% or (z) if the total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.5:1.0, 3.00%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period, plus an applicable margin equal to (x) if total net leverage is greater than 4.0:1.0, 4.50%, (y) if the total net leverage ratio less than or equal to 4.0:1.0 but greater than 3.5:1.0, 4.25% or (z) if the total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.5:1.0, 4.00%. The margin is set at the highest level until the first day following the second full fiscal quarter ending after February 17, 2017 and the total net leverage ratio is determined on the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter then ended. Following an event of default, the New ABL Facility bears interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such loans at such time plus an additional 2.00% per annum during the continuance of such event of default, and the letter of credit fees increase by 2.00%.\nGuarantees. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New ABL Facility, the amounts outstanding under the New ABL Facility are guaranteed by Keane Group, Inc., KGH Intermediate Holdco I, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC, Keane Frac GP, LLC, each ABL Borrower (other than with respect to its own obligations) and each subsidiary of Keane Group, Inc. that will be required to execute and deliver a facility guaranty after February 17, 2017 (collectively, the \"ABL Guarantors\").\nSecurity.

The New ABL Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants (in each case, subject to customary exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New ABL Facility).\nFinancial Covenants. The New ABL Facility provides that if any of (a) an event of default is occurring and continuing, (b) if no loan or letter of credit (other than any letter of credit that has been cash collateralized) is outstanding, liquidity is less than the greater of (i) 15% of the loan cap and (ii) $17,500,000 at any time or (c) if any loan or letter of credit (other than any letter of credit that has been cash collateralized) is outstanding, excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 15% of the loan cap and (ii) $17,500,000 at any time, then the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as of the last day of the most recently completed four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements were required to have been delivered, may not be lower than 1.0:1.0. This financial covenant will remain in effect until the thirtieth consecutive day that all such triggers no longer exist.

The New ABL Facility contains customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New ABL Facility).\n2016 Term Loan Facility\nOn March 16, 2016, KGH Intermediate Holdco I, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC and Keane Frac, LP, entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the 2016 Term Loan Facility\u201d) with certain financial institutions (collectively, the 2016 Term Lenders\u201d) and CLMG Corp., as administrative agent for the 2016 Term Lenders. The 2016 Term Loan Facility initially provided for a $100 million term loan. The 2016 Term Loan Facility was prepaid in full on January 25, 2017 in connection with the IPO.\nIn conjunction with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC executed a new interest rate swap effective March 31, 2016 through May 9, 2019 which was designated as a cash flow hedge. Under the terms of the interest rate swap, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC receives LIBOR based variable interest rate payments, subject to a 1.50% floor, and makes payments based on a fixed rate of 1.868%, thereby effectively creating the equivalent of fixed-rate debt for the notional amount hedged of the 2016 Term Loan Facility. As of December 31, 2016, the notional amount of the interest rate swap is $98.1 million, decreasing quarterly to match the outstanding balance of the 2016 Term Loan Facility.\nNew Term Loan Facility\nOn March 15, 2017, Keane Group, Inc., Keane Group, Keane Frac, LP , KS Drilling, LLC (together with Keane Group, Keane Frac, LP and each other person that becomes a New Term Loan Borrower under the New Term Loan Facility in accordance with the terms thereof, the \"New Term Loan Borrowers\")and the New Term Loan Guarantors (as defined below) entered into a term loan agreement (the \"New Term Loan Facility\") with each lender from time to time party thereto and Owl Rock Capital Corporation as administrative agent and collateral agent. The following is a summary of the material provisions of the New Term Loan Facility. It does not include all of the provisions of the New Term Loan Facility, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the New Term Loan Facility described.\nStructure. The New Term Loan Facility provides for a $150 million initial term loan facility. In addition, subject to certain customary conditions, the New Term Loan Facility allows for incremental term loans in an amount equal to the sum of (a) $50,000,000 (less certain amounts in connection with permitted notes and subordinated\nindebtedness), plus (b) $75,000,000 (less certain amounts in connection with permitted notes and subordinated indebtedness), but only to fund permitted acquisitions subject to, in the case of subclause (b), immediately after giving effect thereto, the minimum liquidity covenant described below is satisfied, plus (c) an unlimited amount, subject to, in the case of subclause (c), immediately after giving effect thereto, the total net leverage ratio being less than 1.75:1.00.\nMaturity. August 18, 2022 or, if earlier, the stated maturity date of any other term loans or term commitments.\nAmortization. The New Term Loan Facility amortizes in quarterly installments equal to 1.00% per annum of the aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding, commencing with June 30, 2017.\nInterest. The initial term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Keane Group's option, (a) the base rate plus 6.25%, or (b) the adjusted LIBOR rate for such interest period (subject to a 1.00% floor) plus 7.25%. Following an event of default, the New Term Loan Facility bears interest at the rate otherwise applicable to such term loans at such time plus an additional 2.00% per annum during the continuance of such event of default.\nPrepayments. The New Term Loan Facility is required to be prepaid with: (a) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and other dispositions, subject to the terms of an intercreditor agreement between the agent for the New Term Loan Facility and the agent for the New ABL Facility and certain exceptions; (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of debt incurrences or issuances (other than debt incurrences permitted under the New Term Loan Agreement) and (c) 50% (subject to step-downs to zero, in accordance with a total net leverage ratio test) of excess cash flow minus certain voluntary prepayments made under the New Term Loan Facility and all voluntary prepayments of loans under the New ABL Facility to the extent the commitments under the New ABL Facility are permanently reduced by such prepayments.\nGuarantees. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New Term Loan Facility, the amounts outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by Keane Group, Inc., KGH Intermediate Holdco I, LLC, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC, Keane Frac GP, LLC, each New Term Loan Borrower (other than with respect to its own obligations) and each subsidiary of Keane Group, Inc. that will be required to execute and deliver a facility guaranty after March 15, 2017 (collectively, the \"New Term Loan Guarantors\").\nSecurity. Subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New Term Loan Facility, the obligations under the New Term Loan Facility are secured by (a) a first-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all of the assets of the New Term Loan Borrowers and the New Term Loan Guarantors to the extent not constituting ABL Facility Priority Collateral and (b) a second-priority security interest in and lien on the ABL Facility Priority Collateral.\nFees. Certain customary fees are payable to the lenders and the agents under the New Term Loan Facility.\nAffirmative and Negative Covenants. The New Term Loan Facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants (in each case, subject to customary exceptions as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New Term Loan Facility).\nFinancial Covenant.

The New Term Loan Facility contains customary events of default (subject to exceptions, thresholds and grace periods as set forth in the definitive documentation for the New Term Loan Facility).\nNote Purchase Agreements\nOn March 16, 2016, KGH Intermediate Holdco II, LLC, entered into an amendment which modified its existing note purchase agreement (as amended, the NPA\u201d) with certain financial institutions (collectively, the Purchasers\u201d) and U.S. Bank National Association, as agent for the Purchasers. The NPA initially provided for $200\nmillion of secured notes (which included a $50 million subfacility for delayed draw notes) (the Notes\u201d). The Notes bore interest at a rate per annum equal to 12.00%. As of December 31, 2016, $190 million of notes were outstanding under the NPA. In connection with the IPO, $50 million of the NPA was paid off on January 25, 2017. As of March 15, 2017, $138.7 million of notes were outstanding under the NPA, which were repaid in full on March 15, 2017 in connection with the Company entering into the New Term Loan Facility, as discussed in detail above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExcept for our normal operating leases, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, transactions or special purpose entities.\nRelated Party Transactions\nPrior to the completion of our IPO, our board of directors adopted a written policy and procedures (the Related Party Policy\u201d) for the review, approval and ratification of the related party transactions by the independent members of the audit and risk committee of our board of directors. For purposes of the Related Party Policy, a Related Party Transaction\u201d is any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including the incurrence or issuance of any indebtedness or the guarantee of indebtedness) in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be reasonably expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, (2) the company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any Related Party (as defined herein) has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. All Related Party Transactions will be reviewed in accordance with the standards set forth in the Related Party Policy after full disclosure of the Related Party's interests in the transaction.\nThe Related Party Policy defines Related Party\u201d as any person who is, or, at any time since the beginning of the company's last fiscal year, was (1) an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director of the company or any of its subsidiaries, (2) a person with greater than five percent (5%) beneficial interest in the company, (3) an immediate family member of any of the individuals or entities identified in (1) or (2) of this paragraph, and (4) any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing individuals or entities is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person or entity has a five percent (5%) or greater beneficial interest. Immediate family members (each, a Family Member\u201d) includes a person's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such person's home, other than a tenant or employee.\nFor further details about our transactions with Related Parties please refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and Note18 (Related Party Transactions) of Keane Group's financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nIn the notes accompanying the audited consolidated financial statements, we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following represent the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from our Completion Services and Other Services segments is earned and recognized as services are rendered, which is generally on a per stage, daily or hourly rate, or on a similar basis. All revenue is recognized\nwhen persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is complete, the amount is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, as follows:\nCompletion Services Revenue\nWe provide hydraulic fracturing and wireline services pursuant to contractual arrangements, such as term contracts and pricing agreements, or on a spot market basis. Revenue is recognized upon the completion of each job. Once a job has been completed to the customer's satisfaction, a field ticket is created that includes charges for the service performed and the chemicals and proppant consumed during the course of the service. The field ticket may also include charges for the mobilization of the equipment to the location, additional equipment used on the job, if any, and other miscellaneous items. This field ticket is used to create an invoice, which is sent to the customer upon the completion of each job.\nOther Services Revenue\nWe provide certain complementary services such as coiled tubing, cementing and drilling pursuant to contractual arrangements, such as term contracts or on a spot basis. We typically charge the customer for the services performed and materials provided on a per job basis.\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nWe calculate depreciation based on the estimated useful lives of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, the cyclical nature of our business, which results in fluctuations in the use of our equipment and the environments in which we operate, could cause us to change our estimates, thus affecting the future calculation of depreciation.\nWe continuously perform repair and maintenance expenditures on our service equipment. Expenditures for renewals and betterments that extend the lives of our service equipment, which may include the replacement of significant components of service equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The determination of whether an expenditure should be capitalized or expensed requires management judgment in the application of how the costs benefit future periods, relative to our capitalization policy. Costs that either establish or increase the efficiency, productivity, functionality or life of a fixed asset are capitalized.\nWe separately identify and account for certain significant components of our hydraulic fracturing units including the engine, transmission, power end and radiator, which requires us to separately estimate the useful lives of these components. For the majority of our other service equipment, we do not separately identify and track depreciation of specific original components. When we replace components of these assets, we typically have to estimate the net book values of the components that are retired, which is based primarily upon replacement cost, age and original estimated useful life.\nDefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nAt December 31, 2016, our balance of definite-lived intangible assets was $44.0 million, and the related amortization reflected in our statement of operations was $5.7 million, $4.9 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These intangible assets are primarily related to customer relationships, trade names, software and proprietary chemical blends acquired in business acquisitions. We calculate amortization for these assets based on their estimated useful lives. When these assets are recorded, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, these estimates contain judgments regarding the future utility of these assets and a change in our assessment of the useful lives of these assets could materially change the future calculation of amortization.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant, equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long-lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives. If the carrying amount is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. We estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows. Our fair value calculations for long-lived assets and intangible assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows, strategic plans, useful lives and market performance. We also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model.\nWe measure the fair value of our property and equipment using the discounted cash flow method or the market approach, the fair value of its customer contracts using the multi-period excess earning method and income based with and without\u201d method, the fair value of its trade names and acquired fracking fluid software technology using the income based relief-from-royalty\u201d method and the fair value of its non-compete agreement using lost income\u201d approach. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on judgmental assessments of projected revenue growth, fleet count, utilization, gross margin rates, SG&A rates, working capital fluctuations, capital expenditures, discount rates and terminal growth rates.\nWe have acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets related to business acquisitions. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We review our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, during the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset may exceed its fair value. If the carrying value of goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss for this difference. Our impairment loss calculations for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values of our reporting units, which have been defined as our reportable segments, and intangible assets, respectively. We estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and comparable market analyses. These types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability, industry factors, planned strategic initiatives, discount rates and other factors.\nIf actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be subject to additional impairment charges, which could be material to our results of operations. For example, if our results of operations significantly decline as a result of a decline in the price of oil, there could be a material increase in the impairment of long-lived assets in future periods. Also, if the actual results or performance of our Completion Services segment are not consistent with our projections, estimates and assumptions, there could be goodwill impairment charges in future periods.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations. We utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest rate risk associated with our floating-rate borrowings. We recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at their respective fair values. For derivatives designated in hedging relationships, changes in the fair value are either offset through earnings against the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged or recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, to the extent the derivative is effective at offsetting the changes in cash flows being hedged, until the hedged item affects earnings.\nWe only enter into derivative contracts that we intend to designate as hedges for the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). For all hedging relationships, we formally document the hedging relationship and our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively and a description of the method used to measure ineffectiveness. We also formally assess, both at the inception of the\nhedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as part of a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, the cash flow hedge is de-designated because a forecasted transaction is not probable of occurring or management determines to remove the designation of the cash flow hedge. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we continue to carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet and recognize any subsequent changes in its fair value in earnings. When it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, we discontinue hedge accounting and recognize immediately in earnings gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income related to the hedging relationship.\nUnit-Based Compensation\nPrior to consummation of the IPO, the Company sponsored a unit-based management compensation program called the Keane Management Holdings LLC Management Incentive Plan (the Class B Plan\u201d). The Company accounted for the units granted under the Class B Plan as compensation cost measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of grant date fair value using an option pricing model is highly complex and requires judgment as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of the Company's common ownership interest pre-IPO, the expected unit price volatility over the expected term of the awards, risk free interest rates, expected dividend yield and discount for lack of marketability pre-IPO. These estimates will not be used to determine the fair value of any awards granted under the Class B Plan following the IPO.\nThe Company recognized compensation expense for the Class B units on a straight-line basis over the service period of the entire award. In connection with the IPO and the reorganization, on January 20, 2017, the Class B Plan was assigned to and assumed by Keane Investor.\nPrior to the completion of the Trican transactions on March 16, 2016, the Company sponsored the Class C Management Incentive Plan (the Class C Plan\u201d), under which Class C units were granted to management. The Class C units granted under the Class C Plan vested based on the participants continued employment with the Company for time-based units and based on both the participants continued employment with the Company and the achievement of performance objectives as determined by the Compensation Committee for performance-based units. The Company estimated the fair value of the Class C units on the date of grant using a Monte-Carlo option pricing model. The Company recognized compensation expense for the Class C units on a straight-line basis over the service period of the entire award for the time-based component and ratably over the vesting period for the performance based component subject to the attainment of certain performance objectives. On March 16, 2016, the Company canceled all outstanding Class C units issued under the Class C Plan and issued to management Class B units under the Class B Plan using an applicable conversion ratio specific to each participant.\nTax Contingencies\nWhile Keane Group is not subject to federal income taxes for U.S. federal tax purposes, it is subject to foreign income tax for Canadian federal and provincial tax purposes. Keane Group is also subject to other state and local taxes, including margin tax in the state of Texas. As such, with the exception of the state of Texas and its Canadian subsidiary, Keane Group is not a taxable entity, it does not directly pay federal and state income taxes and recognition has not been given to federal and state income tax for the operations of the Company. Keane Group's tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by federal, state and local tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding Keane Group's tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the reporting of various taxable transactions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit\nby the various tax authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with Keane Group's various tax filing positions, Keane Group may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which Keane Group has established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. Keane Group adjusts its liability for these tax exposures in the period in which a tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available.\nUpon consummation of the IPO and Organizational Transactions, Keane Group, Inc., a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware, became subject to federal income taxes and will calculate deferred income tax assets and liabilities that could potentially be significant.\nOur liabilities for these tax positions contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be subject to losses or gains that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations\u201d. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities is measured in accordance with the guidance of ASC 850, Fair Value Measurements\u201d, using discounted cash flows and other applicable valuation techniques. Any acquisition related costs incurred by the Company are expensed as incurred. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Operating results of an acquired business are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition. Refer to Note 3 (Acquisition) in Keane Group, Holding, LLC's consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 22 (Recently Adopted Accounting Standards) and Note 23 (Recently Issued Accounting Standards) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "Summary:\nThe report is the MD&A section of an Annual Report on Form 10-K of a company that offers integrated well completion services in the U.S. The company went public in 2017 and operates in various oil and gas basins.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest pure-play providers of integrated well completion services in the U.S., with a focus on complex, technically demanding completion solutions. Our primary service offerings include horizontal and vertical fracturing, wireline perforation and logging and engineered solutions, as well as other value-added service offerings. With approximately 944,250 hydraulic horsepower spread across 23 hydraulic fracturing fleets and 23 wireline trucks located in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation, the Bakken Formation and other active oil and gas basins, we provide industry-leading completion services with a strict focus on health, safety and environmental stewardship and cost-effective customer-centric solutions. Our company prides itself on our outstanding employee culture, our efficiency and our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers and communities in which we operate.\nWe provide our services in conjunction with onshore well development, in addition to stimulation operations on existing wells, to well-capitalized E&P customers, with some of the highest quality and safety standards in the industry and long-term development programs that enable us to maximize operational efficiencies and the return on our assets. We believe our integrated approach and proven capabilities enable us to deliver cost-effective solutions for increasingly complex and technically demanding well completion requirements, which include longer lateral segments, higher pressure rates and proppant intensity, and multiple fracturing stages in challenging high-pressure formations. In addition, our technical team and engineering center, which is located in The Woodlands, Texas,\nprovides us the ability to supplement our service offerings with engineered solutions specifically tailored to address customers' completion requirements and challenges.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 13 hydraulic fracturing fleets and eight wireline trucks operating in the most active unconventional oil and natural gas basins in the U.S., including the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale, the SCOOP/STACK Formation and the Bakken Formation. We are one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the Permian Basin, the Marcellus Shale/Utica Shale and the Bakken Formation by total hydraulic horsepower deployed.\nWe believe the demand for our services will increase over the medium and long-term as a result of a number of favorable industry trends. While drilling and completion activity has improved along with a rebound in commodity prices from their lows in early 2016 of $26.19 per barrel (based on the WTI spot price) and $1.49 per mmBtu for natural gas, we believe there are long-term fundamental demand and supply trends that will benefit our company. We believe demand for our services will grow from:\n\u2022 increases in customer drilling budgets focused in our core service areas;\n\u2022 increases in the percentage of rigs that are drilling horizontal wells;\n\u2022 increases in the length of the typical horizontal wellbore;\n\u2022 increases in the number of fracture stages in a typical horizontal wellbore; and\n\u2022 increases in pad drilling and simultaneous fracturing/wireline operations.\nWe believe demand and pricing for our services will be further enhanced by a reduction in available hydraulic fracturing equipment as a result of:\n\u2022 cannibalization of parked equipment and increased maintenance costs;\n\u2022 aging of existing fleets given the limited investment since the industry downturn in late 2014;\n \u2022 increased customer focus on well-capitalized, safe and efficient service providers that can meet or exceed their requirements; and  \u2022 reduced access to capital for fleet acquisition, maintenance and deployment.\nHow We Generate Our Revenues and Evaluate Our Business\nWe are organized into two reportable segments, consisting of Completion Services, including our hydraulic fracturing and wireline divisions; and Other Services, including our coiled tubing, cementing and drilling divisions. This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our customer base, the complementary nature of our services, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on equipment utilization, revenue, segment gross profit and gross margin. We monitor our cost of services using such metrics as cost of operations per stage for divisions in our Completion Services segment and cost of operations per working day for divisions in our Other Services segment.\nSegment gross profit is a key metric that we use to evaluate segment operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. We define segment gross profit as segment revenues less segment direct and indirect cost of services. Cost of services include direct and indirect labor costs, proppant and freight, maintenance of equipment, chemicals, fuel and transportation freight costs, contract services, crew costs and other miscellaneous expenses. Gross margin is calculated by dividing segment gross profit by segment revenue.\nThe Costs of Conducting Our Business\nThe principal expenses involved in conducting our completion services are materials and freight, labor costs, the costs of maintaining our equipment and fuel costs.\nOur direct labor costs vary with the amount of equipment deployed and the utilization of that equipment. Approximately 81% of our field service employees are paid on an hourly basis. Another key component of labor\ncosts relates to the ongoing training of our field service employees, which improves safety rates and reduces attrition.\nApproximately 97% of our direct cost of services is associated with the Completion Services segment, with a majority of those costs relating to our hydraulic fracturing division. We incur significant costs relating to the proppant, chemicals, guar and fuel used in our hydraulic fracturing operations. These costs fluctuate with usage increases in proportion to increases in the number, size and utilization of our fleets, as well as the prices for each material, including delivery costs.\nFiscal 2016 Highlights\n \u2022 Ranked as one of the top three providers in major growth basins, the Permian, Marcellus / Utica, SCOOP/STACK and Bakken based on deployed hydraulic horsepower \n \u2022 Completed the integration of Trican's U.S. oilfield service operations seamlessly and expanded our hydraulic fracturing capacity to 23 fleets at December 31, 2016, and achieved cost savings of approximately $80 million \n \u2022 Received Shell's Global Well Services Performance Award, recognizing exceptional performance and customer service in hydraulic fracturing and wireline services \n \u2022 Continued strong hiring, retention and training track record \n \u2022 Decreased our TRIR and LTIR by approximately 56% and 50%, respectively, from 2015 to 2016 \n2017 Outlook\nAs described above, we believe the demand for our services will increase over the medium and long-term as a result of a number of favorable industry trends, including projected increases in demand for oil and natural gas liquids products, projected increases in drilling activity, and projected increases in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in the United States. We are encouraged by the increase in well completion activity we are seeing across our diversified footprint. We also believe that several differentiating attributes will enable our future success, including our high-quality, fit-for-purpose and well maintained equipment, our financial strength and discipline, the scale and flexibility of our supply chain, our ability to offer customized completions solutions and our speed-to-market advantage.\nHaving deployed two additional fleets in January 2017 and another one in March 2017, we currently have 16 hydraulic fracturing fleets deployed, representing approximately 70% utilization on our 23 total fleets. We were able to see continued improvement in our pricing for new dedicated capacity agreements, which reflected increased leading-edge pricing of approximately 25% sequentially on a gross basis. These factors and general improvement in market conditions lead us to expect sequential revenue increases of between 30% and 40% in the first quarter of 2017. Offsetting the revenue increases is the recent inflation in input costs, including sand. This inflation will serve as a partial headwind to our profitability, given the lag effect of pricing re-openers on our pressure pumping agreements. However, our agreements with our customers allow us to adjust pricing every three to six months to recover inflation and align contract pricing to market terms. As a result, the inflation in input costs may cause short term margin compression. In addition, we continue to leverage our scale in the market to drive efficiencies on our supply chain and logistics network with increased volume and activity.\nOverall, we believe that favorable trends in pricing, our established business model and the operating efficiency we benefit from with our current customers will enable us to generate attractive cash flow from incremental hydraulic fracturing fleet deployment in 2017. As a result, we are prepared to responsibly accelerate the re-activation of our remaining horsepower subject to the availability of our resources and/or the hiring and proper training of our crews.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for 2016 compared to 2015. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2016 include the financial and operating results of Keane and the Acquired Trican Operations for the period from March 16, 2016 through December 31, 2016. Results for the period prior to March 16, 2016 reflect the financial and operating results of Keane Group only. Accordingly, comparisons of our results for 2016 to 2015 may not be meaningful.\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated:\n\nRevenues. Total revenue is comprised of revenue from Completion Services and Other Services. Revenue in 2016 increased by $54.4 million or 15%, to $420.6 million from $366.2 million in 2015. The increase in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue increased by $47.0 million, or 13%, to $410.9 million in 2016 from $363.8 million in 2015. This change was primarily attributable to a 100% growth in the number of deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets, as a result of increased utilization of our combined asset base following our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations. This increase was offset by a 43% decrease in the revenue per deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet as a result of competitive pricing driven by current market conditions.\nOther Services: Other Services segment revenue increased by $7.4 million, or 316%, to $9.7 million in 2016 from $2.3 million in 2015. The change was primarily attributable to revenues from the coiled tubing and cementing divisions acquired in connection with the Acquired Trican Operations, which contributed $9.7 million of revenue to\nthis segment in 2016. This increase was offset by a $2.3 million reduction in revenues from the drilling division, which was idled in May 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in rig count.\nCosts of services. Costs of services in 2016 increased by $109.7 million, or 36%, when compared to 2015. This increase was driven by higher activity in the Completion Services segment, increased costs in connection with a prolonged completion timeline driven by customer completion delays and increased maintenance costs associated with higher-pressure jobs. In addition, in 2016, we had one-time costs of $23.6 million consisting of acquisition and integration costs of approximately $13.6 million associated with the Acquired Trican Operations and commissioning costs of approximately $10.0 million, including labor and maintenance, to deploy idle hydraulic fracturing fleets and coiled tubing units acquired from Trican. These increases were partially offset by our cost saving initiatives as described below. Costs of services as a percentage of total revenue for in 2016 was 99%, which represented an increase of 15% from 2015. Excluding one-time costs of $23.6 million (described above) and $1.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, total costs of services was $392.7 million and $305.2 million in 2016 and 2015, or 93% and 83% of revenue, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 10%. Costs of services, as a percentage of total revenue is presented below:\n\nThe change in cost of services by reportable segment is further discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment cost of services increased by $96.9 million or 32%, to $401.9 million in 2016 from $305.0 million in 2015. As a percentage of segment revenue, total cost of services was 98% and 84%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 14%. The increase in segment cost of services was driven by higher activity coupled with longer lateral segments and increased proppant volume and increased maintenance costs associated with higher-pressure jobs. In addition, in 2016, we had one-time costs of $22.5 million consisting of acquisition and integration costs of approximately $13.2 million associated with the Acquired Trican Operations and commissioning costs of approximately $9.3 million, including labor and maintenance, to deploy idle hydraulic fracturing fleets acquired from Trican. These increases were partially offset by cost saving initiatives to drive down supply and material costs through negotiated price concessions from vendors, management of labor costs and our fixed cost structure through facility consolidation and other cost saving initiatives related to shipping and equipment costs. Excluding one-time costs of $22.5 million and $0.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, Completion Services segment costs of services was $379.4 million and $304.2 million in 2016 and 2015, or 92% and 84% of segment revenue, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 8%.\nOther Services: Other Services segment cost of services increased by $12.9 million to $14.5 million, or 826% in 2016 from $1.6 million in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to cost of services in connection with the deployment of, and increased headcount related to, our coiled tubing and cementing operations acquired from Trican, which included one-time integration and commissioning costs of $1.1 million. This increase was partially offset by the $0.6 million decrease of cost of services related to the idling of our drilling services in May 2015. We idled our cementing services and coiled tubing division in April 2016 and December 2016, respectively. All associated overhead has been re-allocated to the Completion Services segment or eliminated. Excluding one-time costs of $1.1 million in 2016 described above, and $0.5 million in 2015, Other Services segment costs of services was $13.3 million and $1.1 million in 2016 and 2015, or 137% and 46% of segment revenue, respectively, which is an increase as a percentage of segment revenue of 91%. This increase was a result of unfavorable absorption of fixed costs on low revenue as coiled tubing was a new division acquired as part of the Acquired Trican Operations.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $31.4 million, or 45%, to $101.0 million in 2016 from $69.5 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to additional\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $42.1 million related to the property and equipment included in the Acquired Trican Operations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of Keane's existing equipment due to some assets becoming fully depreciated and reduced capital expenditures in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $27.0 million, or 104%, to $52.8 million in 2016 from $25.8 million in 2015. The increase in SG&A expense is related to increased headcount, property taxes and insurance associated with a larger asset base as a result of the Acquired Trican Operations. SG&A as a percentage of total revenue was 13% in 2016 compared with 7% in 2015. Total one-time charges, excluding unit-based compensation, were $23.4 million in 2016 and $3.5 million in 2015, which were primarily related to the acquisition and integration of the Acquired Trican Operations and professional fees incurred in connection with the IPO. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of our Canadian subsidiary due to $2.5 million of wind-down costs incurred during 2015, which were no longer recurring during 2016. Excluding one-time costs of $23.4 million and $3.5 million described above, SG&A expense was $29.4 million and $22.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represents an increase of 31% primarily driven by the acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations.\nImpairment. In 2016, we recognized impairment expense of $0.2 million as a result of our non-compete agreement relating to the drilling business within our Other Services segment, due to the fact that this non-compete was no longer expected to generate any future cash flows. In 2015, we recognized impairment expense of $3.9 million, which was comprised of a $2.4 million impairment on indefinite-lived intangible assets in our Completion Services segment as a result of the loss of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of Ultra Tech Frac Services, LLC (the UTFS Acquisition\u201d), a $1.2 million impairment on the trade name of our drilling business in our Other Services segment and a $0.3 million impairment on our drilling rig fleet in our Other Services segment.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net, in 2016 decreased by $2.4 million, or 162% to income of $0.9 million from expense of $1.5 million in 2015. This decrease in was primarily driven by an expense recognized in 2015 related to the forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit due to the cancellation of a hydraulic fracturing equipment purchase order, which was no longer recurring during 2016.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by $14.8 million, or 63% to $38.3 million in 2016 from $23.5 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4.9 million increase in interest expense on our Notes due to an increase in the interest rate in accordance with the modified terms of the NPA; $7.0 million interest expense incurred on the 2016 Term Loan Facility in connection with the Trican acquisition; $1.8 million of unrealized and realized losses related to an interest rate swap derivative with all changes in its fair value being recognized within other expenses starting from March 2016, which is the date when hedge accounting was discontinued; and a $3.1 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and higher commitment fees incurred on the 2016 ABL Facility. These increases were partially offset by $1.7 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the forgiveness of interest on the Related Party Loan on March 16, 2016.\nNet income (loss). Net loss was $187.1 million in 2016 as compared with net loss of $64.6 million in 2015. The increase in net loss is due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above. Upon consummation of the IPO, our successor, Keane Group, Inc., became a corporation subject to federal income taxes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for 2015 compared to 2014.\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated:\n\nRevenues. Total revenue is comprised of revenue from Completion Services and Other Services. Revenue in 2015 decreased by $29.7 million, or 7% to $366.2 million from $395.8 million in 2014. The decrease in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue decreased by $19.4 million, or 5% to $363.8 million in 2015 from $383.2 million in 2014. This decline was primarily attributable to a 13% decrease in the revenue per deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet as a result of pricing pressure for our services, partially offset by a 9% increase in the number of deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets.\nOther Services: Other Services segment revenue decreased by $10.3 million, or 82%, to $2.3 million in 2015 from $12.7 million in 2014. The reduction was primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues from drilling services, which were idled in May 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in rig count throughout 2015.\nCosts of Services. Costs of services in 2015 decreased by $17.1 million, or 5%, to $306.6 million from $323.7 million in 2014, primarily due to the decrease in revenue of $29.7 million during the same period. Costs of services as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 were 84%, which represented a slight increase of 2% from the prior year. The decrease in cost of services by reportable segment is further discussed below.\n\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment cost of services decreased by $9.7 million, or 3%, to $305.0 million in 2015 from $314.8 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily related to a decrease in Completion Services segment revenue, coupled with management's continued efforts and focus on cost saving initiatives to drive down supply and material costs through negotiated price concessions from vendors and management of labor costs. As a percentage of segment revenue, Completion Services segment costs of services was 84% and 82% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Services: Other Services segment cost of services decreased by $7.4 million, or 83%, to $1.6 million in 2015 from $8.9 million in 2014. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in cost of services for our drilling services, which were idled in May 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.3 million, or 2%, to $69.5 million in 2015 from $68.3 million in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to additional depreciation associated with new hydraulic fracturing and wireline equipment acquired during the second half of 2014 and 2015, partially offset by higher depreciation charge during 2014 due to the revision of the estimated useful lives of hydraulic fracturing assets with cumulative effect reflected in", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.

This segmentation is based on the primary end markets we serve, our customer base, the complementary nature of our services, our management structure and the financial information that is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. We evaluate the performance of these segments based on equipment utilization, revenue, segment gross profit and gross margin.

As a result, we are prepared to responsibly accelerate the re-activation of our remaining horsepower subject to the availability of our resources and/or the hiring and proper training of our crews.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following is a comparison of our results of operations for 2016 compared to 2015.

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from Completion Services and Other Services. Revenue in 2016 increased by $54.4 million or 15%, to $420.6 million from $366.2 million in 2015. The increase in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue increased by $47.0 million, or 13%, to $410.9 million in 2016 from $363.8 million in 2015. This change was primarily attributable to a 100% growth in the number of deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets, as a result of increased utilization of our combined asset base following our acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations. This increase was offset by a 43% decrease in the revenue per deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet as a result of competitive pricing driven by current market conditions.\nOther Services: Other Services segment revenue increased by $7.4 million, or 316%, to $9.7 million in 2016 from $2.3 million in 2015. The change was primarily attributable to revenues from the coiled tubing and cementing divisions acquired in connection with the Acquired Trican Operations, which contributed $9.7 million of revenue to\nthis segment in 2016. This increase was offset by a $2.3 million reduction in revenues from the drilling division, which was idled in May 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in rig count.\nCosts of services. Costs of services in 2016 increased by $109.7 million, or 36%, when compared to 2015. This increase was driven by higher activity in the Completion Services segment, increased costs in connection with a prolonged completion timeline driven by customer completion delays and increased maintenance costs associated with higher-pressure jobs. In addition, in 2016, we had one-time costs of $23.6 million consisting of acquisition and integration costs of approximately $13.6 million associated with the Acquired Trican Operations and commissioning costs of approximately $10.0 million, including labor and maintenance, to deploy idle hydraulic fracturing fleets and coiled tubing units acquired from Trican. These increases were partially offset by our cost saving initiatives as described below. Costs of services as a percentage of total revenue for in 2016 was 99%, which represented an increase of 15% from 2015. Excluding one-time costs of $23.6 million (described above) and $1.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, total costs of services was $392.7 million and $305.2 million in 2016 and 2015, or 93% and 83% of revenue, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 10%. Costs of services, as a percentage of total revenue is presented below:\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment cost of services as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>149\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of services as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in cost of services by reportable segment is further discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment cost of services increased by $96.9 million or 32%, to $401.9 million in 2016 from $305.0 million in 2015. As a percentage of segment revenue, total cost of services was 98% and 84%, in 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 14%. The increase in segment cost of services was driven by higher activity coupled with longer lateral segments and increased proppant volume and increased maintenance costs associated with higher-pressure jobs. In addition, in 2016, we had one-time costs of $22.5 million consisting of acquisition and integration costs of approximately $13.2 million associated with the Acquired Trican Operations and commissioning costs of approximately $9.3 million, including labor and maintenance, to deploy idle hydraulic fracturing fleets acquired from Trican. These increases were partially offset by cost saving initiatives to drive down supply and material costs through negotiated price concessions from vendors, management of labor costs and our fixed cost structure through facility consolidation and other cost saving initiatives related to shipping and equipment costs. Excluding one-time costs of $22.5 million and $0.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, Completion Services segment costs of services was $379.4 million and $304.2 million in 2016 and 2015, or 92% and 84% of segment revenue, respectively, an increase as a percentage of revenue of 8%.\nOther Services: Other Services segment cost of services increased by $12.9 million to $14.5 million, or 826% in 2016 from $1.6 million in 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to cost of services in connection with the deployment of, and increased headcount related to, our coiled tubing and cementing operations acquired from Trican, which included one-time integration and commissioning costs of $1.1 million. This increase was partially offset by the $0.6 million decrease of cost of services related to the idling of our drilling services in May 2015. We idled our cementing services and coiled tubing division in April 2016 and December 2016, respectively. All associated overhead has been re-allocated to the Completion Services segment or eliminated. Excluding one-time costs of $1.1 million in 2016 described above, and $0.5 million in 2015, Other Services segment costs of services was $13.3 million and $1.1 million in 2016 and 2015, or 137% and 46% of segment revenue, respectively, which is an increase as a percentage of segment revenue of 91%. This increase was a result of unfavorable absorption of fixed costs on low revenue as coiled tubing was a new division acquired as part of the Acquired Trican Operations.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $31.4 million, or 45%, to $101.0 million in 2016 from $69.5 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to additional\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $42.1 million related to the property and equipment included in the Acquired Trican Operations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of Keane's existing equipment due to some assets becoming fully depreciated and reduced capital expenditures in 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expense, which represents costs associated with managing and supporting our operations, increased by $27.0 million, or 104%, to $52.8 million in 2016 from $25.8 million in 2015. The increase in SG&A expense is related to increased headcount, property taxes and insurance associated with a larger asset base as a result of the Acquired Trican Operations. SG&A as a percentage of total revenue was 13% in 2016 compared with 7% in 2015. Total one-time charges, excluding unit-based compensation, were $23.4 million in 2016 and $3.5 million in 2015, which were primarily related to the acquisition and integration of the Acquired Trican Operations and professional fees incurred in connection with the IPO. These costs were partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of our Canadian subsidiary due to $2.5 million of wind-down costs incurred during 2015, which were no longer recurring during 2016. Excluding one-time costs of $23.4 million and $3.5 million described above, SG&A expense was $29.4 million and $22.3 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively, which represents an increase of 31% primarily driven by the acquisition of the Acquired Trican Operations.\nImpairment. In 2016, we recognized impairment expense of $0.2 million as a result of our non-compete agreement relating to the drilling business within our Other Services segment, due to the fact that this non-compete was no longer expected to generate any future cash flows. In 2015, we recognized impairment expense of $3.9 million, which was comprised of a $2.4 million impairment on indefinite-lived intangible assets in our Completion Services segment as a result of the loss of certain customer relationships related to our acquisition of Ultra Tech Frac Services, LLC (the UTFS Acquisition\u201d), a $1.2 million impairment on the trade name of our drilling business in our Other Services segment and a $0.3 million impairment on our drilling rig fleet in our Other Services segment.\nOther expense (income), net. Other expense (income), net, in 2016 decreased by $2.4 million, or 162% to income of $0.9 million from expense of $1.5 million in 2015. This decrease in was primarily driven by an expense recognized in 2015 related to the forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit due to the cancellation of a hydraulic fracturing equipment purchase order, which was no longer recurring during 2016.\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by $14.8 million, or 63% to $38.3 million in 2016 from $23.5 million in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4.9 million increase in interest expense on our Notes due to an increase in the interest rate in accordance with the modified terms of the NPA; $7.0 million interest expense incurred on the 2016 Term Loan Facility in connection with the Trican acquisition; $1.8 million of unrealized and realized losses related to an interest rate swap derivative with all changes in its fair value being recognized within other expenses starting from March 2016, which is the date when hedge accounting was discontinued; and a $3.1 million increase in amortization of debt issuance costs and higher commitment fees incurred on the 2016 ABL Facility. These increases were partially offset by $1.7 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the forgiveness of interest on the Related Party Loan on March 16, 2016.\nNet income (loss). Net loss was $187.1 million in 2016 as compared with net loss of $64.6 million in 2015. The increase in net loss is due to the changes in revenues and expenses discussed above. Upon consummation of the IPO, our successor, Keane Group, Inc., became a corporation subject to federal income taxes.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nThe

Total revenue is comprised of revenue from Completion Services and Other Services. Revenue in 2015 decreased by $29.7 million, or 7% to $366.2 million from $395.8 million in 2014. The decrease in revenue by reportable segment is discussed below.\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment revenue decreased by $19.4 million, or 5% to $363.8 million in 2015 from $383.2 million in 2014. This decline was primarily attributable to a 13% decrease in the revenue per deployed hydraulic fracturing fleet as a result of pricing pressure for our services, partially offset by a 9% increase in the number of deployed hydraulic fracturing fleets.\nOther Services: Other Services segment revenue decreased by $10.3 million, or 82%, to $2.3 million in 2015 from $12.7 million in 2014. The reduction was primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues from drilling services, which were idled in May 2015 as a result of the significant decrease in rig count throughout 2015.\nCosts of Services. Costs of services in 2015 decreased by $17.1 million, or 5%, to $306.6 million from $323.7 million in 2014, primarily due to the decrease in revenue of $29.7 million during the same period. Costs of services as a percentage of total revenue in 2015 were 84%, which represented a slight increase of 2% from the prior year. The decrease in cost of services by reportable segment is further discussed below.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Description\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment cost of services as a percentage of segment revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Completion Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4\n</td> <td>%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of services as a percentage of total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCompletion Services: Completion Services segment cost of services decreased by $9.7 million, or 3%, to $305.0 million in 2015 from $314.8 million in 2014. This decrease is primarily related to a decrease in Completion Services segment revenue, coupled with management's continued efforts and focus on cost saving initiatives to drive down supply and material costs through negotiated price concessions from vendors and management of labor costs. As a percentage of segment revenue, Completion Services segment costs of services was 84% and 82% in 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther Services: Other Services segment cost of services decreased by $7.4 million, or 83%, to $1.6 million in 2015 from $8.9 million in 2014. The decrease was attributable to a reduction in cost of services for our drilling services, which were idled in May 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.3 million, or 2%, to $69.5 million in 2015 from $68.3 million in 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to additional depreciation associated with new hydraulic fracturing and wireline equipment acquired during the second half of 2014 and 2015, partially offset by higher depreciation charge during 2014 due to the revision of the estimated useful lives of hydraulic fracturing assets with cumulative effect reflected in"}
