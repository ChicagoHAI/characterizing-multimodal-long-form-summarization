MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional factors relating to such statements, and see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Past operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results in any future periods.\nOverview\nWe are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa\u00ae, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, RoclatanTM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of building a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. This sales force of 100 sales representatives will initially be responsible for sales of Rhopressa\u00ae, and will also be responsible for sales of RoclatanTM, if approved. We also seek to enhance our longer-term commercial potential by identifying and advancing additional product candidates. This may be accomplished through our internal discovery efforts, our entry into potential research collaborations or in-licensing arrangements or our acquisition of additional ophthalmic products or technologies or product candidates that complement our current product portfolio, such as our recent collaboration with DSM, whereby we have access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia, designed to advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases, as discussed below.\nOur strategy also includes developing our business outside of North America, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan. In 2015, we revised our corporate structure to align with our business strategy outside of North America by establishing Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited. We assigned the beneficial rights to our non-U.S. and non-Canadian intellectual property for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM to Aerie Limited. As part of the IP Assignment, we and Aerie Limited entered into a research and development cost-sharing agreement pursuant to which we and Aerie Limited will share the costs of the development of intellectual property and Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited entered into a license arrangement pursuant to which Aerie Ireland Limited will develop and commercialize the beneficial rights of the intellectual property assigned as part of the IP Assignment. In 2016, we assigned the beneficial rights to certain of our intellectual property in the United States and Canada to Aerie Distribution and amended and restated the research and development cost-sharing agreement to transfer our rights and obligations under the agreement to Aerie Distribution.\nIn January 2017, we announced that we are building a new manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, although we will continue to use product sourced from our current contract manufacturer based in the United States. This will be our first manufacturing plant, which is expected to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae and, if approved, RoclatanTM. Our current contract manufacturer started producing commercial supply of Rhopressa\u00ae prior to Rhopressa\u00ae obtaining FDA approval in anticipation of such approval. Commercial supply from our own manufacturing plant is expected to be available by 2020. We are also in the process of adding a second contract manufacturer, which we expect may produce commercial supply by as early as the end of 2018.\nWe own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. We have patent protection for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally, through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.\nProduct and Product Candidate Overview\nRhopressa\u00ae, our product approved by the FDA, has demonstrated that it reduces IOP through ROCK inhibition, its MOA, by which Rhopressa\u00ae increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the TM, which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage from the eye. Our late-stage pipeline consists of RoclatanTM, a single-drop fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa\u00ae and latanoprost, which reduces IOP through the same MOA as Rhopressa\u00ae and, through a second MOA, utilizing the ability of latanoprost to increase the outflow of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye's secondary drain. Both are\ntaken once-daily in the evening and have shown in preclinical and clinical trials to be effective in reducing IOP, with a favorable safety profile.\nRhopressa\u00ae\nOur FDA-approved product, Rhopressa\u00ae, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa\u00ae, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa\u00ae represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa\u00ae will have the potential to compete with non-PGA products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to PGAs, due to its targeting of the diseased TM, its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa\u00ae may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.\nWe resubmitted our NDA for Rhopressa\u00ae to the FDA on February 28, 2017, and received approval from the FDA on December 18, 2017, two months earlier than the scheduled PDUFA date of February 28, 2018. FDA approval was based on efficacy data from three Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocket 1, Rocket 2 and Rocket 4, in which once-daily Rhopressa\u00ae was demonstrated to be non-inferior to twice-daily timolol. In addition, the 12-month safety data from the Rocket 2 registration trial confirmed a favorable safety profile for the drug and demonstrated a consistent IOP-reducing effect throughout the 12-month period at the specified measurement time points. We also included as supportive data the 90-day efficacy results of our Mercury 1 trial for RoclatanTM, further discussed below, with the NDA submission for Rhopressa\u00ae.\nOur Rocket 4 trial for Rhopressa\u00ae was designed to generate adequate six-month safety data for European regulatory approval, along with efficacy and safety data from our other Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocket 1 and Rocket 2. We expect to file an MAA for Rhopressa\u00ae with the EMA in the second half of 2018. We also initiated Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are designed to meet the requirements of Japan's PMDA for potential regulatory submission of Rhopressa\u00ae in Japan. These clinical trials enrolled Japanese and Japanese-American subjects to support subsequent Phase 3 registration trials that are expected to be conducted in Japan.\nRoclatanTM\nOur advanced-stage product candidate, RoclatanTM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa\u00ae and latanoprost. We believe, based on our clinical data, that RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of currently available therapies.\nWe have completed two Phase 3 registration trials for RoclatanTM. The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 1,\u201d was a 12-month safety trial with a 90-day efficacy readout. Mercury 1 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components, including Rhopressa\u00ae and the market-leading PGA, latanoprost, and the safety and tolerability results showed no drug-related serious adverse events. On July 19, 2017, we announced the Mercury 1 12-month safety results, noting the safety results for RoclatanTM showed no treatment-related serious adverse events and minimal evidence of treatment-related systemic effects. There were no new adverse events that developed over the 12-month period relative to the 90-day results, and there were no drug-related serious or systemic adverse events.\nThe second Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 2,\u201d was a 90-day efficacy and safety trial also designed to demonstrate statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components. The Mercury 2 trial design was identical to that of Mercury 1, except that Mercury 2 was a 90-day trial without the additional nine-month safety extension included in Mercury 1. Both Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 achieved their 90-day primary efficacy endpoints of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM over each of its components at all measured time points in patients with maximum baseline IOPs of above 20 mmHg to below 36 mmHg. We expect to submit an NDA for RoclatanTM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018.\nMercury 1 and Mercury 2 will also be used for European approval of RoclatanTM, and we initiated a third Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 3,\u201d in Europe during the third quarter of 2017. Mercury 3, a six-month safety trial, is designed to compare RoclatanTM to Ganfort\u00ae, a fixed-dose combination product of bimatoprost, a PGA, and timolol marketed in Europe. If successful, Mercury 3 is expected to improve our commercialization prospects in Europe. We currently expect to read out topline 90-day efficacy data for the trial in the first half of 2019 and to submit an MAA with the EMA for RoclatanTM by the end of 2019.\nPipeline Opportunities\nOur stated objective is to build a major ophthalmic pharmaceutical company. We are evaluating possible uses of our existing proprietary portfolio of Rho kinase inhibitors beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Our owned preclinical small molecule, AR-13503 (an earlier generation of which was known as AR-13154), has demonstrated the potential for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet AMD by inhibiting Rho kinase and Protein kinase C. As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. When used in combination with the market-leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This molecule has not yet been tested in humans in a clinical trial setting. Pending additional studies, AR-13503 may have the potential to provide an entirely new mechanism and pathway to treat diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, such as DME. We expect to submit an IND for AR-13503 in 2019. Since AR-13503 is a small molecule with a short half-life, and the aforementioned diseases are located in the back of the eye, a delivery mechanism is needed to deliver the molecule to the back of the eye for a sustained delivery period.\nTo that end, on July 31, 2017, we announced that we entered into a collaborative research, development and licensing agreement with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands. The research collaboration agreement includes an option to license DSM's bio-erodible polymer implant technology for sustained delivery of certain Aerie compounds to treat ophthalmic diseases. This technology uses polyesteramide polymers to produce an injectable, thin fiber that is minute in size. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated early success in conjunction with AR-13503, including demonstration of linear, sustained elution rates over several months and achievement of target retinal drug concentrations.\nFurther, on October 4, 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT\u00ae technology in ophthalmology and certain other assets from Envisia. The PRINT\u00ae technology is a proprietary system capable of creating precisely-engineered sustained release products utilizing fully-scalable manufacturing processes. In addition, we acquired Envisia's intellectual property rights relating to Envisia's preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant for the potential treatment of DME that also utilizes the PRINT\u00ae technology, which we refer to as AR-1105. We expect to submit an IND for AR-1105 in late 2018. We will also focus on using PRINT\u00ae to manufacture injectable implants containing AR-13503, potentially in conjunction with the bio-erodible polymer from DSM.\nWe may continue to enter into research collaboration arrangements, license, acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, and we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners. We are currently focused on the evaluation of technologies for the delivery of our owned molecules to the back of the eye over sustained periods. We are also currently screening our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for indications beyond ophthalmology, considering third-party studies and trials have demonstrated potential for Rho kinase inhibition in treating certain disease categories. We are initially focused on exploring potential opportunities for our molecules in pulmonary health, dermatology and cancers.\nFinancial Overview\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $249.7 million as of December 31, 2017, and we have subsequently raised an additional $136.2 million through a now-completed at-the-market\u201d offering and through sales of our common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated January 23, 2018 related to a registered public offering. We believe our cash and investments balances are adequate to provide for our current ongoing needs, though there may be need for additional financing activity as we continue to grow, including the potential use of a line of credit to finance the potential growth in our inventories and accounts receivable once Rhopressa\u00ae is launched, which we expect to be in the mid-second quarter of 2018. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in June 2005. To date, we have not generated any revenue. We received FDA approval for Rhopressa\u00ae on December 18, 2017, and expect to launch Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States in mid-second quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to commence generating product revenues from sales of Rhopressa\u00ae in mid-2018. We will not generate any revenue from RoclatanTM or any future product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products.\nHistorically, our operations have primarily been limited to research and development and raising capital. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $461.7 million. We recorded net losses of $145.1 million, $99.1 million and $74.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our capital resources and business efforts are largely focused on preparation for commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, advancing our product pipeline, international expansion\nand construction of our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae is, or RoclatanTM or any other products that may be approved in the future are, commercially successful, if at all. If we do not successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or RoclatanTM or any future product candidates, if approved, we may be unable to generate product revenue or achieve profitability. We may be required to obtain further funding through public or private offerings, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization or manufacturing efforts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for all officers and employees in general management, sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration. Other significant expenses include pre-approval commercial-related manufacturing costs, pre-launch sales and marketing planning activities, facilities expenses and professional fees for audit, tax, legal and other services.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase due to the commercialization efforts for Rhopressa\u00ae, including the expected hiring of sales representatives and additional employees focused on sales, marketing and manufacturing activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the research and development of our preclinical and clinical candidates, which include:\nTable 251: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with any collaboration arrangements, licenses or acquisitions of preclinical molecules, product candidates or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs associated with regulatory operations; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with research institutions, consultants and CROs that assist in conducting and managing clinical trials. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If future timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. Historically, such modifications have not been material.\nExcluding the $24.8 million of expense recognized in 2017 related to the Envisia asset acquisition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in 2018 due to clinical trial activities for both Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM for jurisdictions outside of the United States and for research initiatives aimed at advancing our pipeline, including our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense) primarily includes interest income, interest expense, and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments, and amortization or accretion of discounts and premiums on our investments. Interest expense consists of interest expense under the 2014 Convertible Notes, including the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated liability related to our build-to-suit lease obligation, which is held by a subsidiary with a U.S. dollar functional currency.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of stock-based compensation, fair value measurements and certain research and development expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The following accounting policies are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include:\nTable 257: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting preclinical and clinical trials or that produce commercial inventory prior to FDA approval; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>fees paid to service providers for audit, tax, legal and other services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We accrue our expenses related to clinical trials based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct research activities and/or manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.\nIf we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. Although we do not currently anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The estimated fair value of the 2014 Convertible Notes was $327.6 million and $209.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the estimated fair value of the 2014 Convertible Notes was primarily attributable to the increase in the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016.\nAcquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions to determine whether the acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805: Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805\u201d). Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In an asset acquisition that does not constitute a business, no goodwill is recognized, and the net assets acquired are generally recorded at cost. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). The ASU clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, or disposed of, is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The new standard was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2018; however, we elected to early adopt this ASU as of July 1, 2017. Under ASC Topic 805, including the provisions of ASU 2017-01, the October 4, 2017 transaction to acquire assets from Envisia was determined to meet the criteria of an asset acquisition rather than a business combination, resulting in a $24.8 million charge to research and development expense on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the three months ended December 31, 2017 for acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d). Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in a determination of whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award for employees, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense for options granted to non-employees is determined as the fair value of consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is remeasured each period until the related service is complete. The fair value of restricted stock awards ( RSAs\u201d), including restricted stock awards with non-market performance and service conditions ( PSAs\u201d) is determined based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense related to RSAs is recognized ratably over the vesting period. As the PSAs have multiple performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized for each vesting tranche over the respective requisite service period of each tranche if and when we deem it probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Compensation expense for stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan is measured and recognized on the date that we become obligated to issue shares of our common stock and is based on the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the purchase price on such date.\nSignificant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value\nDetermining the appropriate fair value measurement of stock-based awards requires the use of subjective assumptions. We estimate the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is affected by our common stock fair values as well as assumptions regarding a number of other subjective variables. These other variables include the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options at the grant date using the following assumptions:\nTable 261: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fair Value of our Common Stock. The fair value for our underlying common stock is determined using the closing price on the date of grant as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Volatility. We calculate expected volatility based on our historical volatility in combination with reported data for a selected group of similar publicly traded companies, or guideline peer group, for which the relevant historical information is available. We selected representative companies from the pharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development and therapeutic focus. We will continue to use a combination of our historical volatility and the guideline peer group volatility information for the foreseeable future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Expected Term. We used the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise and post-vesting termination data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nvesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The midpoint between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method.\nTable 264: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Risk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected time to exercise.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Forfeiture.

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for an explanation of our forfeiture policy election change and the related financial statement impact based on the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, forfeitures were estimated such that we only recognized expense for the shares expected to vest, and adjustments were made if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Dividend Yield.

Realization of future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Due to our history of operating losses and lack of available evidence supporting future taxable income, we maintain a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, with the exception of a release of valuation allowance during the year on a deferred tax asset related to a $1.7 million AMT refund that we expect to receive under the Tax Act. The amount of refund expected to be received is recorded as a non-current receivable.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nTable 268: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\nCHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>73,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>72,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>145,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(145,693\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>(1,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(146,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,866\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47,997\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily associated with the expansion of our employee base to support\nthe growth of our operations as well as expenses incurred in connection with preparatory commercial manufacturing activities, which commenced in 2016.\nEmployee-related expenses increased by $15.0 million, including an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense of $7.0 million. Our preparatory commercial manufacturing activities have primarily been related to the validation and scale-up of our current manufacturing activities for which we incurred $10.6 million of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017. Certain of our direct preparatory commercial operations and manufacturing activities were recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses prior to receiving FDA approval of Rhopressa\u00ae. Going forward, certain of these costs will be capitalized as inventory. Expenses related to our pre-launch sales and marketing planning activities increased by $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased by $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily related to the acquisition of assets from Envisia in which $24.8 million of acquired IPR&D was expensed during the year ended December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of the Envisia asset acquisition, research and development expenses decreased by $5.1 million primarily related to the completion of the Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM for U.S. approval, partially offset by expenses incurred for RoclatanTM registration trials for European approval and for Rhopressa\u00ae clinical trials designed for potential future approval in Japan. Research and development expenses for Rhopressa\u00ae totaled $5.3 million and $12.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Research and development expenses for RoclatanTM totaled $7.5 million and $15.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, employee-related expenses increased by $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to an increase in headcount to support the growth of our operations.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists of the following:\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,368\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>(555\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(459\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,170\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(41\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net decreased by $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to additional interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the increase in our cash, cash equivalents and investments, partially offset by an increase in unrealized foreign exchange loss included in other expense related to the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated build-to-suit lease obligation, which is held by a subsidiary with a U.S. dollar functional currency.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 270: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses\n</td> <td>52,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>96,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(96,872\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,786\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense), net\n</td> <td>(1,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,856\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(98,866\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,224\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(24,642\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $13.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily associated with the expansion of our employee base to support the growth of our operations as well as expenses incurred in connection with preparatory commercial manufacturing activities, which commenced in 2016.\nEmployee-related expenses increased by $6.2 million, including an increase in employee stock-based compensation expense of $2.6 million. Our preparatory commercial manufacturing activities were related to the validation and scale-up of our manufacturing activities for which we incurred $7.5 million of expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our research and development activity was primarily associated with Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. Research and development expenses increased by $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Costs for RoclatanTM increased by $11.6 million as a result of commencing Mercury 1 and preparatory activities for our other Phase 3 registration trials for RoclatanTM. Costs for Rhopressa\u00ae decreased by $10.0 million. Both Rocket 1 and Rocket 2 commenced in July 2014. Rocket 1 was completed in April 2015 and we began to incur expenses for Rocket 4 in mid-2015. In addition, employee-related expenses increased by $3.6 million as a result of an increase in headcount to support the growth of our operations.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net consists of the following:\nTable 271: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>YEAR ENDED\nDECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>CHANGE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% CHANGE\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(2,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>(96\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,987\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,994\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,856\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther income (expense), net decreased by $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a $2.9 million state tax benefit recognized in 2015 upon the sale of deferred state tax benefits to unrelated third parties, which did not occur in 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have funded operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and the issuance of convertible notes. We have incurred losses and experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae is, or RoclatanTM or any other products that may be approved in the future are, commercially successful, if at all.\nSources of Liquidity\nSince our initial public offering in October 2013, we have issued:\nTable 272: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>$125.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2014 Convertible Notes, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $122.9 million, after deducting discounts and certain expenses of $2.1 million,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Approximately 11.0 million shares of our common stock through December 31, 2017, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $351.3 million, after deducting fees and expenses.

The increase in net loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the expansion of our employee base and commercial operations and manufacturing activities in preparation for the launch of Rhopressa\u00ae. The increases are partially offset by reductions in expenditures for clinical trials as the Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM concluded in the United States.\nInvesting Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our investing activities used net cash of $42.8 million primarily related to purchases of available-for-sale investments of $104.5 million, purchases of property, plant and equipment of $16.0 million, primarily related to the build-out of our manufacturing plant in Ireland, and a $10.5 million cash payment for the acquisition of assets from Envisia, which were partially offset by maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments of $88.2 million. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2016, our investing activities provided net cash of $18.1 million primarily related to maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments of $58.3 million, which were partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale investments of $35.2 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $5.1 million to support the growth of our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our investing activities provided net cash of $9.4 million primarily related to maturities and sales of available-for-sale investments of $59.5 million, which were partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale investments of $46.9 million and purchases of software and equipment of $3.3 million.\nFinancing Activities\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our financing activities provided net cash of $135.6 million, $168.6 million and $51.8 million, respectively. The net cash provided by financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to the issuance and sale of common stock under our prior at-the-market\u201d sales agreements and under underwriting agreements related to registered public offerings, from which we received net proceeds of approximately $134.2 million, $167.4 million and $50.5 million, respectively.\nCapital Requirements\nWe expect to incur ongoing operating losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae is, or RoclatanTM or any other products that may be approved in the future are, commercially successful, if at all. We received FDA approval for Rhopressa\u00ae on December 18, 2017, and expect to launch Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States in mid-second quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to commence generating product revenues related to sales of Rhopressa\u00ae in mid-2018.\nOur principal liquidity requirements are for: working capital; future increased operational expenses; commercialization and manufacturing activities; expenses associated with developing our pipeline opportunities, including pursuing strategic growth opportunities; costs associated with executing our international expansion strategy, including clinical and potential commercialization activities in Europe and Japan; contractual obligations; capital expenditures, including completing our manufacturing plant in Ireland; and debt service payments.\nIn January 2017, we entered into a lease agreement for a new manufacturing plant in Ireland under which we are leasing approximately 30,000 square feet of interior floor space for build-out. Capital expenditures related to the manufacturing plant\ntotaled approximately $17.4 million in 2017. Estimated remaining equipment, construction and other related capital costs as of December 31, 2017 are approximately $27 million (excluding the potential impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations), of which approximately $24 million is expected to be spent in 2018.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments balance as of December 31, 2017 together with the financing net proceeds received in January 2018, discussed above, will provide sufficient resources to support our commercial activities for Rhopressa\u00ae through at least the next twelve months and to support the expected approval and planned commercialization of RoclatanTM in the United States.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the following:\nTable 276: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of commercialization activities for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM and any future product candidates, if approved, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and related product sales performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>commercial performance of Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM or any future product candidates, if approved;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs, timing and outcome of seeking regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 279: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>timing and costs of our ongoing and future clinical trials and preclinical studies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs to complete our new manufacturing plant in Ireland;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of any follow-on development or products, including the exploration and/or development of any additional indications or additional opportunities for new ophthalmic product candidates, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of any new business strategies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 283: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>costs of operating as a public company, including legal, compliance, accounting and investor relations activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>terms and timing of any acquisitions, collaborations, licensing, consulting or other arrangements; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We based our projections on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect or unreliable or may change due to circumstances beyond our control, and as a result, we may consume our available capital resources earlier than we originally projected. We may need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations or we may decide, based on various factors, that additional financings are desirable. If such funding is required, we cannot guarantee that it will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all.\nIncome Taxes and Net Operating Loss Carryforwards\nWe have incurred significant net operating losses ( NOLs\u201d) since our inception in June 2005. We expect to continue to incur NOLs until Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM and any future product candidates, if approved, are commercially successful, if at all. We received FDA approval for Rhopressa\u00ae on December 18, 2017, and expect to launch Rhopressa\u00ae in mid-second quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to commence generating product revenues related to sales of Rhopressa\u00ae in mid-2018; however, we do not expect to generate taxable income in 2018. The NOLs may be utilized to offset taxable income generated in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $196.2 million and $271.3 million, respectively, which will begin to expire at various dates beginning in 2024 through 2037, if not utilized.\nNOLs and tax credit carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities and may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a three-year period in excess of 50%, as defined under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as well as similar state provisions. This could limit the amount of tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of our company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law and enacted significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This new tax legislation, among other changes, reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be revalued during the period in which the new tax legislation is enacted, which resulted in the remeasurement of our federal deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the effects of the enacted changes in tax rate. As we provide a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets, there was no impact to income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the remeasurement. The Tax Act also repealed the corporate AMT for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and provides that existing AMT credit carryovers are refundable in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. We have approximately $1.7 million of AMT credit carryovers that we expect to be fully refunded between 2019 and 2022. The Tax Act also limits various business deductions, modifies the maximum deduction of NOLs and includes various international tax provisions. Many provisions in the Tax Act are generally effective in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and we will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to certain aspects of the Tax Act in assessing the potential impact on Aerie in the future. However, we do not expect the impact of the Tax Act to be material over the next twelve months given we do not expect to generate taxable income in 2018. On December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant may not have the necessary information available in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects. We have recognized provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax assets and the income tax benefit recognized for refundable AMT. The final impact assessment will be completed as additional information becomes available, but no later than one year from the enactment of the Tax Act, and may differ from provisional amounts, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, additional regulatory guidance that may be issued, the filing of our tax return and actions the we may take as a result of the Tax Act.\nOutstanding Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2017, our total indebtedness consisted of our $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2014 Convertible Notes. For a discussion of the 2014 Convertible Notes, see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>TOTAL\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>LESS THAN\n1 YEAR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 TO 3 YEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 TO 5 YEARS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>MORE THAN\n5 YEARS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible Notes(2)\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>125,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on Convertible Notes(2)\n</td> <td>8,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,381\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(3)\n</td> <td>9,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,619\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Our lease obligations are primarily related to our principal executive office and research facility in Durham, North Carolina, and corporate offices in Bedminster, New Jersey, Irvine, California and Dublin, Ireland.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional factors relating to such statements, and see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Past operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results in any future periods.\nOverview\nWe are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa\u00ae, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, RoclatanTM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of building a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. This sales force of 100 sales representatives will initially be responsible for sales of Rhopressa\u00ae, and will also be responsible for sales of RoclatanTM, if approved. We also seek to enhance our longer-term commercial potential by identifying and advancing additional product candidates. This may be accomplished through our internal discovery efforts, our entry into potential research collaborations or in-licensing arrangements or our acquisition of additional ophthalmic products or technologies or product candidates that complement our current product portfolio, such as our recent collaboration with DSM, whereby we have access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia, designed to advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases, as discussed below.\nOur strategy also includes developing our business outside of North America, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan. In 2015, we revised our corporate structure to align with our business strategy outside of North America by establishing Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited. We assigned the beneficial rights to our non-U.S. and non-Canadian intellectual property for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM to Aerie Limited. As part of the IP Assignment, we and Aerie Limited entered into a research and development cost-sharing agreement pursuant to which we and Aerie Limited will share the costs of the development of intellectual property and Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited entered into a license arrangement pursuant to which Aerie Ireland Limited will develop and commercialize the beneficial rights of the intellectual property assigned as part of the IP Assignment. In 2016, we assigned the beneficial rights to certain of our intellectual property in the United States and Canada to Aerie Distribution and amended and restated the research and development cost-sharing agreement to transfer our rights and obligations under the agreement to Aerie Distribution.\nIn January 2017, we announced that we are building a new manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, although we will continue to use product sourced from our current contract manufacturer based in the United States. This will be our first manufacturing plant, which is expected to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae and, if approved, RoclatanTM. Our current contract manufacturer started producing commercial supply of Rhopressa\u00ae prior to Rhopressa\u00ae obtaining FDA approval in anticipation of such approval. Commercial supply from our own manufacturing plant is expected to be available by 2020. We are also in the process of adding a second contract manufacturer, which we expect may produce commercial supply by as early as the end of 2018.\nWe own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. We have patent protection for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally, through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.\nProduct and Product Candidate Overview\nRhopressa\u00ae, our product approved by the FDA, has demonstrated that it reduces IOP through ROCK inhibition, its MOA, by which Rhopressa\u00ae increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the TM, which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage from the eye. Our late-stage pipeline consists of RoclatanTM, a single-drop fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa\u00ae and latanoprost, which reduces IOP through the same MOA as Rhopressa\u00ae and, through a second MOA, utilizing the ability of latanoprost to increase the outflow of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye's secondary drain. Both are\ntaken once-daily in the evening and have shown in preclinical and clinical trials to be effective in reducing IOP, with a favorable safety profile.\nRhopressa\u00ae\nOur FDA-approved product, Rhopressa\u00ae, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa\u00ae, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa\u00ae represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa\u00ae will have the potential to compete with non-PGA products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to PGAs, due to its targeting of the diseased TM, its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa\u00ae may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.\nWe resubmitted our NDA for Rhopressa\u00ae to the FDA on February 28, 2017, and received approval from the FDA on December 18, 2017, two months earlier than the scheduled PDUFA date of February 28, 2018. FDA approval was based on efficacy data from three Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocket 1, Rocket 2 and Rocket 4, in which once-daily Rhopressa\u00ae was demonstrated to be non-inferior to twice-daily timolol. In addition, the 12-month safety data from the Rocket 2 registration trial confirmed a favorable safety profile for the drug and demonstrated a consistent IOP-reducing effect throughout the 12-month period at the specified measurement time points. We also included as supportive data the 90-day efficacy results of our Mercury 1 trial for RoclatanTM, further discussed below, with the NDA submission for Rhopressa\u00ae.\nOur Rocket 4 trial for Rhopressa\u00ae was designed to generate adequate six-month safety data for European regulatory approval, along with efficacy and safety data from our other Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocket 1 and Rocket 2. We expect to file an MAA for Rhopressa\u00ae with the EMA in the second half of 2018. We also initiated Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are designed to meet the requirements of Japan's PMDA for potential regulatory submission of Rhopressa\u00ae in Japan. These clinical trials enrolled Japanese and Japanese-American subjects to support subsequent Phase 3 registration trials that are expected to be conducted in Japan.\nRoclatanTM\nOur advanced-stage product candidate, RoclatanTM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa\u00ae and latanoprost. We believe, based on our clinical data, that RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of currently available therapies.\nWe have completed two Phase 3 registration trials for RoclatanTM. The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 1,\u201d was a 12-month safety trial with a 90-day efficacy readout. Mercury 1 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components, including Rhopressa\u00ae and the market-leading PGA, latanoprost, and the safety and tolerability results showed no drug-related serious adverse events. On July 19, 2017, we announced the Mercury 1 12-month safety results, noting the safety results for RoclatanTM showed no treatment-related serious adverse events and minimal evidence of treatment-related systemic effects. There were no new adverse events that developed over the 12-month period relative to the 90-day results, and there were no drug-related serious or systemic adverse events.\nThe second Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 2,\u201d was a 90-day efficacy and safety trial also designed to demonstrate statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components. The Mercury 2 trial design was identical to that of Mercury 1, except that Mercury 2 was a 90-day trial without the additional nine-month safety extension included in Mercury 1. Both Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 achieved their 90-day primary efficacy endpoints of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM over each of its components at all measured time points in patients with maximum baseline IOPs of above 20 mmHg to below 36 mmHg. We expect to submit an NDA for RoclatanTM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018.\nMercury 1 and Mercury 2 will also be used for European approval of RoclatanTM, and we initiated a third Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 3,\u201d in Europe during the third quarter of 2017. Mercury 3, a six-month safety trial, is designed to compare RoclatanTM to Ganfort\u00ae, a fixed-dose combination product of bimatoprost, a PGA, and timolol marketed in Europe. If successful, Mercury 3 is expected to improve our commercialization prospects in Europe. We currently expect to read out topline 90-day efficacy data for the trial in the first half of 2019 and to submit an MAA with the EMA for RoclatanTM by the end of 2019.\nPipeline Opportunities\nOur stated objective is to build a major ophthalmic pharmaceutical company. We are evaluating possible uses of our existing proprietary portfolio of Rho kinase inhibitors beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Our owned preclinical small molecule, AR-13503 (an earlier generation of which was known as AR-13154), has demonstrated the potential for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet AMD by inhibiting Rho kinase and Protein kinase C. As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. When used in combination with the market-leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This molecule has not yet been tested in humans in a clinical trial setting. Pending additional studies, AR-13503 may have the potential to provide an entirely new mechanism and pathway to treat diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, such as DME. We expect to submit an IND for AR-13503 in 2019. Since AR-13503 is a small molecule with a short half-life, and the aforementioned diseases are located in the back of the eye, a delivery mechanism is needed to deliver the molecule to the back of the eye for a sustained delivery period.\nTo that end, on July 31, 2017, we announced that we entered into a collaborative research, development and licensing agreement with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands. The research collaboration agreement includes an option to license DSM's bio-erodible polymer implant technology for sustained delivery of certain Aerie compounds to treat ophthalmic diseases. This technology uses polyesteramide polymers to produce an injectable, thin fiber that is minute in size. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated early success in conjunction with AR-13503, including demonstration of linear, sustained elution rates over several months and achievement of target retinal drug concentrations.\nFurther, on October 4, 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT\u00ae technology in ophthalmology and certain other assets from Envisia. The PRINT\u00ae technology is a proprietary system capable of creating precisely-engineered sustained release products utilizing fully-scalable manufacturing processes. In addition, we acquired Envisia's intellectual property rights relating to Envisia's preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant for the potential treatment of DME that also utilizes the PRINT\u00ae technology, which we refer to as AR-1105. We expect to submit an IND for AR-1105 in late 2018. We will also focus on using PRINT\u00ae to manufacture injectable implants containing AR-13503, potentially in conjunction with the bio-erodible polymer from DSM.\nWe may continue to enter into research collaboration arrangements, license, acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, and we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners. We are currently focused on the evaluation of technologies for the delivery of our owned molecules to the back of the eye over sustained periods. We are also currently screening our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for indications beyond ophthalmology, considering third-party studies and trials have demonstrated potential for Rho kinase inhibition in treating certain disease categories. We are initially focused on exploring potential opportunities for our molecules in pulmonary health, dermatology and cancers.\nFinancial Overview\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $249.7 million as of December 31, 2017, and we have subsequently raised an additional $136.2 million through a now-completed at-the-market\u201d offering and through sales of our common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated January 23, 2018 related to a registered public offering. We believe our cash and investments balances are adequate to provide for our current ongoing needs, though there may be need for additional financing activity as we continue to grow, including the potential use of a line of credit to finance the potential growth in our inventories and accounts receivable once Rhopressa\u00ae is launched, which we expect to be in the mid-second quarter of 2018. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in June 2005. To date, we have not generated any revenue. We received FDA approval for Rhopressa\u00ae on December 18, 2017, and expect to launch Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States in mid-second quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to commence generating product revenues from sales of Rhopressa\u00ae in mid-2018. We will not generate any revenue from RoclatanTM or any future product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products.\nHistorically, our operations have primarily been limited to research and development and raising capital. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $461.7 million. We recorded net losses of $145.1 million, $99.1 million and $74.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our capital resources and business efforts are largely focused on preparation for commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, advancing our product pipeline, international expansion\nand construction of our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae is, or RoclatanTM or any other products that may be approved in the future are, commercially successful, if at all. If we do not successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or RoclatanTM or any future product candidates, if approved, we may be unable to generate product revenue or achieve profitability. We may be required to obtain further funding through public or private offerings, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization or manufacturing efforts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for all officers and employees in general management, sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration. Other significant expenses include pre-approval commercial-related manufacturing costs, pre-launch sales and marketing planning activities, facilities expenses and professional fees for audit, tax, legal and other services.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase due to the commercialization efforts for Rhopressa\u00ae, including the expected hiring of sales representatives and additional employees focused on sales, marketing and manufacturing activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the research and development of our preclinical and clinical candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies; \n \u2022 costs associated with any collaboration arrangements, licenses or acquisitions of preclinical molecules, product candidates or technologies; \n \u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities; \n \u2022 costs associated with regulatory operations; and \n \u2022 depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities.  Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with research institutions, consultants and CROs that assist in conducting and managing clinical trials. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If future timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. Historically, such modifications have not been material.\nExcluding the $24.8 million of expense recognized in 2017 related to the Envisia asset acquisition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in 2018 due to clinical trial activities for both Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM for jurisdictions outside of the United States and for research initiatives aimed at advancing our pipeline, including our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense) primarily includes interest income, interest expense, and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments, and amortization or accretion of discounts and premiums on our investments. Interest expense consists of interest expense under the 2014 Convertible Notes, including the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated liability related to our build-to-suit lease obligation, which is held by a subsidiary with a U.S. dollar functional currency.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of stock-based compensation, fair value measurements and certain research and development expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The following accounting policies are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include:\n \u2022 fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting preclinical and clinical trials or that produce commercial inventory prior to FDA approval; and \n \u2022 fees paid to service providers for audit, tax, legal and other services.  We accrue our expenses related to clinical trials based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct research activities and/or manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.\nIf we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. Although we do not currently anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The estimated fair value of the 2014 Convertible Notes was $327.6 million and $209.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the estimated fair value of the 2014 Convertible Notes was primarily attributable to the increase in the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016.\nAcquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions to determine whether the acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805: Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805\u201d). Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In an asset acquisition that does not constitute a business, no goodwill is recognized, and the net assets acquired are generally recorded at cost. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). The ASU clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, or disposed of, is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The new standard was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2018; however, we elected to early adopt this ASU as of July 1, 2017. Under ASC Topic 805, including the provisions of ASU 2017-01, the October 4, 2017 transaction to acquire assets from Envisia was determined to meet the criteria of an asset acquisition rather than a business combination, resulting in a $24.8 million charge to research and development expense on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the three months ended December 31, 2017 for acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d). Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in a determination of whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award for employees, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense for options granted to non-employees is determined as the fair value of consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is remeasured each period until the related service is complete. The fair value of restricted stock awards ( RSAs\u201d), including restricted stock awards with non-market performance and service conditions ( PSAs\u201d) is determined based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense related to RSAs is recognized ratably over the vesting period. As the PSAs have multiple performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized for each vesting tranche over the respective requisite service period of each tranche if and when we deem it probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Compensation expense for stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan is measured and recognized on the date that we become obligated to issue shares of our common stock and is based on the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the purchase price on such date.\nSignificant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value\nDetermining the appropriate fair value measurement of stock-based awards requires the use of subjective assumptions. We estimate the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is affected by our common stock fair values as well as assumptions regarding a number of other subjective variables. These other variables include the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options at the grant date using the following assumptions:\n \u2022 Fair Value of our Common Stock. The fair value for our underlying common stock is determined using the closing price on the date of grant as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market. \n \u2022 Volatility. We calculate expected volatility based on our historical volatility in combination with reported data for a selected group of similar publicly traded companies, or guideline peer group, for which the relevant historical information is available. We selected representative companies from the pharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development and therapeutic focus. We will continue to use a combination of our historical volatility and the guideline peer group volatility information for the foreseeable future. \n \u2022 Expected Term. We used the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise and post-vesting termination data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each \nvesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The midpoint between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method.\n \u2022 Risk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected time to exercise. \n \u2022 Forfeiture. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for an explanation of our forfeiture policy election change and the related financial statement impact based on the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, forfeitures were estimated such that we only recognized expense for the shares expected to vest, and adjustments were made if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. \n \u2022 Dividend Yield. Except for a one-time cash dividend related to the spin-off of certain non-core intellectual property that occurred in 2012, we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  Key weighted average assumptions utilized in the fair value calculation for the underlying common stock as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 appear in the table below.\n YEAR", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for additional factors relating to such statements, and see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Past operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results in any future periods.\nOverview\nWe are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa\u00ae, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, RoclatanTM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of building a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. This sales force of 100 sales representatives will initially be responsible for sales of Rhopressa\u00ae, and will also be responsible for sales of RoclatanTM, if approved. We also seek to enhance our longer-term commercial potential by identifying and advancing additional product candidates. This may be accomplished through our internal discovery efforts, our entry into potential research collaborations or in-licensing arrangements or our acquisition of additional ophthalmic products or technologies or product candidates that complement our current product portfolio, such as our recent collaboration with DSM, whereby we have access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia, designed to advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases, as discussed below.\nOur strategy also includes developing our business outside of North America, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan. In 2015, we revised our corporate structure to align with our business strategy outside of North America by establishing Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited. We assigned the beneficial rights to our non-U.S. and non-Canadian intellectual property for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM to Aerie Limited. As part of the IP Assignment, we and Aerie Limited entered into a research and development cost-sharing agreement pursuant to which we and Aerie Limited will share the costs of the development of intellectual property and Aerie Limited and Aerie Ireland Limited entered into a license arrangement pursuant to which Aerie Ireland Limited will develop and commercialize the beneficial rights of the intellectual property assigned as part of the IP Assignment. In 2016, we assigned the beneficial rights to certain of our intellectual property in the United States and Canada to Aerie Distribution and amended and restated the research and development cost-sharing agreement to transfer our rights and obligations under the agreement to Aerie Distribution.\nIn January 2017, we announced that we are building a new manufacturing plant in Athlone, Ireland, although we will continue to use product sourced from our current contract manufacturer based in the United States. This will be our first manufacturing plant, which is expected to produce commercial supplies of Rhopressa\u00ae and, if approved, RoclatanTM. Our current contract manufacturer started producing commercial supply of Rhopressa\u00ae prior to Rhopressa\u00ae obtaining FDA approval in anticipation of such approval. Commercial supply from our own manufacturing plant is expected to be available by 2020. We are also in the process of adding a second contract manufacturer, which we expect may produce commercial supply by as early as the end of 2018.\nWe own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM. We have patent protection for Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally, through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.\nProduct and Product Candidate Overview\nRhopressa\u00ae, our product approved by the FDA, has demonstrated that it reduces IOP through ROCK inhibition, its MOA, by which Rhopressa\u00ae increases the outflow of aqueous humor through the TM, which accounts for approximately 80% of fluid drainage from the eye. Our late-stage pipeline consists of RoclatanTM, a single-drop fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa\u00ae and latanoprost, which reduces IOP through the same MOA as Rhopressa\u00ae and, through a second MOA, utilizing the ability of latanoprost to increase the outflow of aqueous humor through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye's secondary drain. Both are\ntaken once-daily in the evening and have shown in preclinical and clinical trials to be effective in reducing IOP, with a favorable safety profile.\nRhopressa\u00ae\nOur FDA-approved product, Rhopressa\u00ae, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa\u00ae, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa\u00ae represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa\u00ae will have the potential to compete with non-PGA products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to PGAs, due to its targeting of the diseased TM, its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa\u00ae may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.\nWe resubmitted our NDA for Rhopressa\u00ae to the FDA on February 28, 2017, and received approval from the FDA on December 18, 2017, two months earlier than the scheduled PDUFA date of February 28, 2018. FDA approval was based on efficacy data from three Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocket 1, Rocket 2 and Rocket 4, in which once-daily Rhopressa\u00ae was demonstrated to be non-inferior to twice-daily timolol. In addition, the 12-month safety data from the Rocket 2 registration trial confirmed a favorable safety profile for the drug and demonstrated a consistent IOP-reducing effect throughout the 12-month period at the specified measurement time points. We also included as supportive data the 90-day efficacy results of our Mercury 1 trial for RoclatanTM, further discussed below, with the NDA submission for Rhopressa\u00ae.\nOur Rocket 4 trial for Rhopressa\u00ae was designed to generate adequate six-month safety data for European regulatory approval, along with efficacy and safety data from our other Phase 3 registration trials for Rhopressa\u00ae, Rocket 1 and Rocket 2. We expect to file an MAA for Rhopressa\u00ae with the EMA in the second half of 2018. We also initiated Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, which are designed to meet the requirements of Japan's PMDA for potential regulatory submission of Rhopressa\u00ae in Japan. These clinical trials enrolled Japanese and Japanese-American subjects to support subsequent Phase 3 registration trials that are expected to be conducted in Japan.\nRoclatanTM\nOur advanced-stage product candidate, RoclatanTM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa\u00ae and latanoprost. We believe, based on our clinical data, that RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of currently available therapies.\nWe have completed two Phase 3 registration trials for RoclatanTM. The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 1,\u201d was a 12-month safety trial with a 90-day efficacy readout. Mercury 1 achieved its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components, including Rhopressa\u00ae and the market-leading PGA, latanoprost, and the safety and tolerability results showed no drug-related serious adverse events. On July 19, 2017, we announced the Mercury 1 12-month safety results, noting the safety results for RoclatanTM showed no treatment-related serious adverse events and minimal evidence of treatment-related systemic effects. There were no new adverse events that developed over the 12-month period relative to the 90-day results, and there were no drug-related serious or systemic adverse events.\nThe second Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 2,\u201d was a 90-day efficacy and safety trial also designed to demonstrate statistical superiority of RoclatanTM to each of its components. The Mercury 2 trial design was identical to that of Mercury 1, except that Mercury 2 was a 90-day trial without the additional nine-month safety extension included in Mercury 1. Both Mercury 1 and Mercury 2 achieved their 90-day primary efficacy endpoints of demonstrating statistical superiority of RoclatanTM over each of its components at all measured time points in patients with maximum baseline IOPs of above 20 mmHg to below 36 mmHg. We expect to submit an NDA for RoclatanTM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018.\nMercury 1 and Mercury 2 will also be used for European approval of RoclatanTM, and we initiated a third Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 3,\u201d in Europe during the third quarter of 2017. Mercury 3, a six-month safety trial, is designed to compare RoclatanTM to Ganfort\u00ae, a fixed-dose combination product of bimatoprost, a PGA, and timolol marketed in Europe. If successful, Mercury 3 is expected to improve our commercialization prospects in Europe. We currently expect to read out topline 90-day efficacy data for the trial in the first half of 2019 and to submit an MAA with the EMA for RoclatanTM by the end of 2019.\nPipeline Opportunities\nOur stated objective is to build a major ophthalmic pharmaceutical company. We are evaluating possible uses of our existing proprietary portfolio of Rho kinase inhibitors beyond glaucoma and ophthalmology. Our owned preclinical small molecule, AR-13503 (an earlier generation of which was known as AR-13154), has demonstrated the potential for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet AMD by inhibiting Rho kinase and Protein kinase C. As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. When used in combination with the market-leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This molecule has not yet been tested in humans in a clinical trial setting. Pending additional studies, AR-13503 may have the potential to provide an entirely new mechanism and pathway to treat diabetic retinopathy, wet AMD and related diseases of the retina, such as DME. We expect to submit an IND for AR-13503 in 2019. Since AR-13503 is a small molecule with a short half-life, and the aforementioned diseases are located in the back of the eye, a delivery mechanism is needed to deliver the molecule to the back of the eye for a sustained delivery period.\nTo that end, on July 31, 2017, we announced that we entered into a collaborative research, development and licensing agreement with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands. The research collaboration agreement includes an option to license DSM's bio-erodible polymer implant technology for sustained delivery of certain Aerie compounds to treat ophthalmic diseases. This technology uses polyesteramide polymers to produce an injectable, thin fiber that is minute in size. Preclinical experiments have demonstrated early success in conjunction with AR-13503, including demonstration of linear, sustained elution rates over several months and achievement of target retinal drug concentrations.\nFurther, on October 4, 2017, we acquired the rights to use PRINT\u00ae technology in ophthalmology and certain other assets from Envisia. The PRINT\u00ae technology is a proprietary system capable of creating precisely-engineered sustained release products utilizing fully-scalable manufacturing processes. In addition, we acquired Envisia's intellectual property rights relating to Envisia's preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant for the potential treatment of DME that also utilizes the PRINT\u00ae technology, which we refer to as AR-1105. We expect to submit an IND for AR-1105 in late 2018. We will also focus on using PRINT\u00ae to manufacture injectable implants containing AR-13503, potentially in conjunction with the bio-erodible polymer from DSM.\nWe may continue to enter into research collaboration arrangements, license, acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies to broaden our presence in ophthalmology, and we continually explore and discuss potential additional opportunities for new ophthalmic products, delivery alternatives and new therapeutic areas with potential partners. We are currently focused on the evaluation of technologies for the delivery of our owned molecules to the back of the eye over sustained periods. We are also currently screening our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for indications beyond ophthalmology, considering third-party studies and trials have demonstrated potential for Rho kinase inhibition in treating certain disease categories. We are initially focused on exploring potential opportunities for our molecules in pulmonary health, dermatology and cancers.\nFinancial Overview\nOur cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $249.7 million as of December 31, 2017, and we have subsequently raised an additional $136.2 million through a now-completed at-the-market\u201d offering and through sales of our common stock pursuant to an underwriting agreement dated January 23, 2018 related to a registered public offering. We believe our cash and investments balances are adequate to provide for our current ongoing needs, though there may be need for additional financing activity as we continue to grow, including the potential use of a line of credit to finance the potential growth in our inventories and accounts receivable once Rhopressa\u00ae is launched, which we expect to be in the mid-second quarter of 2018. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception in June 2005. To date, we have not generated any revenue. We received FDA approval for Rhopressa\u00ae on December 18, 2017, and expect to launch Rhopressa\u00ae in the United States in mid-second quarter of 2018. As a result, we expect to commence generating product revenues from sales of Rhopressa\u00ae in mid-2018. We will not generate any revenue from RoclatanTM or any future product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products.\nHistorically, our operations have primarily been limited to research and development and raising capital. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $461.7 million. We recorded net losses of $145.1 million, $99.1 million and $74.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our capital resources and business efforts are largely focused on preparation for commercialization of Rhopressa\u00ae, advancing our product pipeline, international expansion\nand construction of our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland. As a result, we expect to continue to incur operating losses until such a time when Rhopressa\u00ae is, or RoclatanTM or any other products that may be approved in the future are, commercially successful, if at all. If we do not successfully commercialize Rhopressa\u00ae or RoclatanTM or any future product candidates, if approved, we may be unable to generate product revenue or achieve profitability. We may be required to obtain further funding through public or private offerings, debt financing, collaboration and licensing arrangements or other sources. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or commercialization or manufacturing efforts.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for all officers and employees in general management, sales and marketing, manufacturing, finance, and administration. Other significant expenses include pre-approval commercial-related manufacturing costs, pre-launch sales and marketing planning activities, facilities expenses and professional fees for audit, tax, legal and other services.\nWe expect that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase due to the commercialization efforts for Rhopressa\u00ae, including the expected hiring of sales representatives and additional employees focused on sales, marketing and manufacturing activities.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nWe expense research and development costs to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the research and development of our preclinical and clinical candidates, which include:\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense for research and development personnel; \n \u2022 expenses incurred under agreements with CROs, contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies; \n \u2022 costs associated with any collaboration arrangements, licenses or acquisitions of preclinical molecules, product candidates or technologies; \n \u2022 costs associated with preclinical activities and development activities; \n \u2022 costs associated with regulatory operations; and \n \u2022 depreciation expense for assets used in research and development activities.  Our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of patient enrollment and related expenses at clinical investigator sites as well as estimates for the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with research institutions, consultants and CROs that assist in conducting and managing clinical trials. We accrue expenses related to clinical trials based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol. If future timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed, we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly on a prospective basis. Historically, such modifications have not been material.\nExcluding the $24.8 million of expense recognized in 2017 related to the Envisia asset acquisition, we expect that our research and development expenses will increase in 2018 due to clinical trial activities for both Rhopressa\u00ae and RoclatanTM for jurisdictions outside of the United States and for research initiatives aimed at advancing our pipeline, including our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense) primarily includes interest income, interest expense, and foreign exchange gains and losses. Interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and investments, and amortization or accretion of discounts and premiums on our investments. Interest expense consists of interest expense under the 2014 Convertible Notes, including the amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the remeasurement of our Euro-denominated liability related to our build-to-suit lease obligation, which is held by a subsidiary with a U.S. dollar functional currency.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Significant estimates include assumptions used in the determination of stock-based compensation, fair value measurements and certain research and development expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. The following accounting policies are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with applicable vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include:\n \u2022 fees paid to CROs in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials; \n \u2022 fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations and service providers that assist in conducting preclinical and clinical trials or that produce commercial inventory prior to FDA approval; and \n \u2022 fees paid to service providers for audit, tax, legal and other services.  We accrue our expenses related to clinical trials based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and CROs that conduct research activities and/or manage clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the level of effort varies from our estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly.\nIf we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. Although we do not currently anticipate the future settlement of existing accruals to differ materially from our estimates, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low for any period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The estimated fair value of the 2014 Convertible Notes was $327.6 million and $209.6 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in the estimated fair value of the 2014 Convertible Notes was primarily attributable to the increase in the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2017 as compared to December 31, 2016.\nAcquisitions\nWe evaluate acquisitions to determine whether the acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805: Business Combinations ( ASC Topic 805\u201d). Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, whereby assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values and any excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In an asset acquisition that does not constitute a business, no goodwill is recognized, and the net assets acquired are generally recorded at cost. In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business ( ASU 2017-01\u201d). The ASU clarifies the definition of a business and provides a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, or disposed of, is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The new standard was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2018; however, we elected to early adopt this ASU as of July 1, 2017. Under ASC Topic 805, including the provisions of ASU 2017-01, the October 4, 2017 transaction to acquire assets from Envisia was determined to meet the criteria of an asset acquisition rather than a business combination, resulting in a $24.8 million charge to research and development expense on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the three months ended December 31, 2017 for acquired in-process research and development ( IPR&D\u201d). Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in a determination of whether an acquisition is a business combination or an acquisition of assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management, but are inherently uncertain.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation costs related to stock options granted to employees ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award for employees, based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. Compensation expense for options granted to non-employees is determined as the fair value of consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measured. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is remeasured each period until the related service is complete. The fair value of restricted stock awards ( RSAs\u201d), including restricted stock awards with non-market performance and service conditions ( PSAs\u201d) is determined based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense related to RSAs is recognized ratably over the vesting period. As the PSAs have multiple performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized for each vesting tranche over the respective requisite service period of each tranche if and when we deem it probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Compensation expense for stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan is measured and recognized on the date that we become obligated to issue shares of our common stock and is based on the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the purchase price on such date.\nSignificant Factors, Assumptions and Methodologies Used in Determining Fair Value\nDetermining the appropriate fair value measurement of stock-based awards requires the use of subjective assumptions. We estimate the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is affected by our common stock fair values as well as assumptions regarding a number of other subjective variables. These other variables include the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nWe estimate the fair value of stock options at the grant date using the following assumptions:\n \u2022 Fair Value of our Common Stock. The fair value for our underlying common stock is determined using the closing price on the date of grant as reported on The NASDAQ Global Market. \n \u2022 Volatility. We calculate expected volatility based on our historical volatility in combination with reported data for a selected group of similar publicly traded companies, or guideline peer group, for which the relevant historical information is available. We selected representative companies from the pharmaceutical industry with similar characteristics to us, including stage of product development and therapeutic focus. We will continue to use a combination of our historical volatility and the guideline peer group volatility information for the foreseeable future. \n \u2022 Expected Term. We used the simplified method as prescribed by the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise and post-vesting termination data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The simplified method is based on the vesting period and the contractual term for each grant, or for each \nvesting-tranche for awards with graded vesting. The midpoint between the vesting date and the maximum contractual expiration date is used as the expected term under this method.\n \u2022 Risk-free Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected time to exercise. \n \u2022 Forfeiture. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report for an explanation of our forfeiture policy election change and the related financial statement impact based on the new guidance effective January 1, 2017. Prior to the adoption of this guidance, forfeitures were estimated such that we only recognized expense for the shares expected to vest, and adjustments were made if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. \n \u2022 Dividend Yield. Except for a one-time cash dividend related to the spin-off of certain non-core intellectual property that occurred in 2012, we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  Key weighted average assumptions utilized in the fair value calculation for the underlying common stock as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 appear in the table below.\n YEAR"}
